AB Food sharing offers a clear example of prosocial behaviour, in which one individual's actions benefit another. Researchers have proposed a range of hypotheses that explain why food sharing may occur among unrelated individuals. Two such hypotheses, reciprocity and dominance, have been tested in many species, including fish, corvids, rats, bats and primates, showing that (1) recipients sometimes reciprocate sharing back to previous donors and (2) dominant individuals share more than subordinates. Although primates dominate the study of prosocial behaviour, active donation of food is actually quite rare in primates. In contrast, several corvid species spontaneously share food much more frequently. Here, we explored the role of reciprocity and dominance in spontaneous food sharing among male pinyon jays, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus, a North American corvid species that exhibits high levels of social complexity. Unlike much of the previous work, we tested prosocial behaviour among unrelated, non-pair-bonded adults. We observed high levels of active sharing, and donors showed clear preferences with whom they shared. We found no evidence that pinyon jays reciprocated shares in either the short or long term. This was true for both sharing within dyads (direct reciprocity) and sharing irrespective of most recent partner identity (generalized reciprocity). However, dominance influenced sharing in one of our squads, with dominant individuals sharing more than subordinates. This study highlights corvids as a fruitful model for the study of the proximate mechanisms underlying naturally occurring prosocial behaviours.

AB Eutherian mammals are unique in that sensory input from each eye is exchanged and shared between left and right brain hemispheres through the corpus callosum. All other vertebrates lack this structure and hence interocular information exchange is more restricted, raising issues of how information acquired with each eye contributes to the control of behaviour. Studies of food hoarding, laboratory- based discrimination tasks and homing in birds show that information acquired with one eye is not immediately available for action guided by the opposite one. We investigated interocular transfer, using filial imprinting in pekin ducklings, Anas platyrhynchos domestica, as our experimental system. In experiment 1 we imprinted hatchlings on either of two duck decoys, in three treatments differing on whether (A) birds were trained and later tested for a following response binocularly, (B) trained and tested monocularly, with the same eye, or (C) trained and tested monocularly, with opposite eyes. Birds preferred the training decoy for at least 3 h after imprinting in treatments A and B, but were indifferent in C. In experiment 2 birds were imprinted sequentially with two decoys, in three treatments where they were (D) trained and tested binocularly, (E) trained monocularly with a different decoy for each eye and tested monocularly with each eye, or (F) trained monocularly with a different decoy for each eye and tested binocularly. In treatment D ducklings were close to indifference, with a weak preference for the most recent decoy. In treatment E preference weakly favoured the decoy used during imprinting with the eye being tested. Finally, in treatment F there was no evidence for dominance of either eye. Thus, imprinting information is laterally isolated for at least 3 h, the experience status of the opposite eye (naIve or with a competing imprinting) has a small effect and we found no evidence for eye dominance.

AB Parental behaviour often exhibits plasticity to factors expected to affect the benefits or costs of care. For example, parent songbirds typically increase their provisioning behaviour as nestlings mature. Several mechanisms exist that could allow parents to track nestling age and provide appropriate care. We performed a short-term experiment on house sparrows, Passer domesticus, in which offspring of different ages were exchanged to assess the level of flexibility parents exhibit and the likely cues they use. We found that a pair's rate of food delivery, an individual parent's visit rate to the nest, the duration of a foraging trip, and both the time a parent was in the nest and how long they perched near the nest after emerging from feeding nestlings changed according to the age of the offspring at the time. This shift in parenting was evident by the second visit after the swap. The amount of food brought per trip did not change with either natural or manipulated age. While females spent more time in the nest than males, there were no sex differences in the responses to the experiment. Food delivery rate increased nestling mass gain during each phase of the experiment, suggesting that parental plasticity in delivery was beneficial to offspring. However, there was an additional effect of the experiment on nestling weight gain, suggesting possible effects of food type brought during each phase of the experiment. Parent sparrows appear to use cues of offspring age over a time span that differs greatly from the natural time course of changes in nestling demand. This extension of plasticity into unnatural conditions has implications for understanding individual differences in plasticity and how at least some organisms might adjust to rapid and unusual environmental change.

AB Learned song is among the best-studied models of animal communication. In oscine songbirds, where learned song is most prevalent, it is used primarily for intrasexual selection and mate attraction. Learning of a different class of vocal signals, known as contact calls, is found in a diverse array of species, where they are used to mediate social interactions among individuals. We argue that call learning provides a taxonomically rich system for studying testable hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of vocal learning. We describe and critically evaluate four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses for the origin and current function of vocal learning of calls, which propose that call learning (1) improves auditory detection and recognition, (2) signals local knowledge, (3) signals group membership, or (4) allows for the encoding of more complex social information. We propose approaches to testing these four hypotheses but emphasize that all of them share the idea that social living, not sexual selection, is a central driver of vocal learning. Finally, we identify future areas for research on call learning that could provide new perspectives on the origins and mechanisms of vocal learning in both animals and humans.

   does feeding behaviour serve as a signal?

AB Acorn woodpeckers, Melanerpes formicivorus, are cooperative breeders in which social groups consist of both nonbreeding helpers at the nest (offspring from prior reproductive attempts) and cobreeders of one or both sexes (usually siblings or a parent and his/her offspring). Regardless of composition, groups generally have one nest at a time at which all individuals participate in provisioning offspring. We tested the hypothesis that provisioning behaviour serves a signalling function used to gain social advantages within groups by enhancing dominance or social prestige, or by reducing the likelihood of being expelled from the group ('pay-to-stay'). We found that birds adjusted their provisioning behaviour based on the activities of other group members by clumping their visits and by alternating their visits with other group members, thus synchronizing and coordinating provisioning within groups. Despite this evidence that acorn woodpeckers respond to the provisioning behaviour of other group members, analyses of feeding rates and patterns of overlap revealed no support for the hypothesis that provisioning functions as a signal to other group members in any of three ways: breeder males signalling to breeder females to increase their probability of mating; helpers signalling to other helpers to enhance their dominance or social prestige; or helpers signalling to breeders to reduce the probability that they will be considered 'lazy' and be evicted from the group. Our results add to previous studies that have thus far failed to support a signalling function for provisioning behaviour in avian cooperative breeders.

AB A wide variety of animals display same-sex behaviours, including courtship, copulation and pairing. However, these behaviours create a paradox, as selection seemingly acts on maladaptive traits, and they have often been regarded as cases of mistaken identity, especially in invertebrates. We show that termite males show nest establishment and pairing formation that usually occur in monogamous colony foundation and demonstrate how this contributes to their fitness. We found that pairs of male dealates stopped searching for females and established nests without females, although single males rarely ceased searching for mates. Males in these male-male pairings had much higher survival than single males. Our colony fusion experiment showed that a male in a surviving same-sex pair can replace a male in an incipient colony and produce offspring. A mathematical model demonstrated that the observed strategy of establishing a male-male pairing instead of searching for females is advantageous when the risk of predation is high, even when colony fusion is very rare. These results indicate that, under certain ecological conditions, a cooperative same-sex pairing with a potential rival for reproduction can be adaptive. Our study implies the existence of various possibilities for explaining the adaptive significance of same-sex sexual behaviours. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals may use multiple signalling modalities to discriminate between conspecific versus heterospecific animals, or between individuals that represent a threat versus a mating opportunity. Multimodal signals used in intra- and interspecific discrimination can serve as redundant signals, or each modality may convey unique information. Furthermore, signals in different modalities may show different transmission properties through different habitats. In this study we investigated how two congeneric wrens, rufous -and -white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, and banded wrens, Thryophilus pleurostictus, use acoustic and visual signals for species discrimination in tropical forest habitats. We coupled song playback experiments with visual models to assess the importance of these signals, both in combination and in isolation. We assessed vegetation density in the territories of both species to assess whether more densely vegetated territories influence the use of visual signals. We presented both rufous -and -white wrens and banded wrens with conspecific and congeneric song treatments, model treatments and song -accompanied -by -model treatments. We found that both species responded strongly to song and song -accompanied -by -model treatments, but showed little or no response when the model was presented alone. These results suggest that wrens rely heavily on acoustic signals and very little on visual signals for discrimination. The species differed in their response to conspecific and congeneric trials, with rufous -and -white wrens showing little response to the congeneric trials but banded wrens responding strongly to both conspecific and congeneric trials. The asymmetrical response to the playback trials suggests that there may be a social dominance relationship between these two species, with rufous -and white wrens being dominant over banded wrens. No previous studies have investigated the relative importance of acoustic and visual signals in males and females for species discrimination. Our results suggest that acoustic signals are more important than visual signals for inconspicuous animals living in dense environments. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Investigations of intraspecific laterality of primates' gestural communication aim to shed light on the evolutionary origins of human handedness and language. Currently, little is known concerning laterality of gestures for purely intraspecific communication. As far as we know, this study is the first to assess laterality of gorillas' purely intraspecific gestures at the population level. We analysed hand use in dyadic interactions in 35 gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla, living in three groups in captivity focusing on their most frequent communication gesture types. We revealed a right-hand bias at the population level for the majority of the most frequent gestures recorded. Our findings support the evolutionary theories predicting that population level asymmetry should be found in fitness -relevant social behaviours and could be explained by an evolutionarily stable strategy based on intraspecific interactions. They also agree with reports evidencing predominant right-hand use for gestural communication by nonhuman primates and suggesting that gestural laterality is a precursor of the left -hemispheric lateralization of language.

AB The disruption of daily rhythms is one of the most studied ecological consequences of light pollution. Previous work showed that several songbird species initiated dawn song earlier in areas with light pollution. However, the mechanisms underlying this shift are still unknown. Individuals may immediately adjust their timing of singing to the presence of artificial light (behavioural plasticity), but the observed effect may also be due to phenotype-dependent habitat choice, effects of conditions during early life or micro-evolution. The main aim of this study was to experimentally investigate how males of four common passerine species respond to day-to-day variation in the presence of artificial night lighting in terms of the timing of singing. During two consecutive breeding seasons, we manipulated the presence of light throughout the night in a cyclic fashion in several naturally undisturbed forest patches. We show that individuals of all four species immediately and reversibly adjusted their onset of dawn singing in response to artificial light. The effect was strongest in the European robin, but relatively small in the blue tit, the great tit and the blackbird. The effect in the latter two species was smaller than expected from the correlational studies. This may be coincidence (small sample size of this study), but it could also indicate that there are longer-term effects of living in light-polluted urban areas on timing of dawn singing, or that birds use compensatory behaviours such as light avoidance. We found no evidence that our light treatment had carryover effects into the subsequent dark period, but robins progressively advanced their dawn singing during the light treatment.

AB Social laterality is the core of two major theories: one concerns the evolution of laterality at the population level and the other the evolution of human language. However, few studies have investigated gestural laterality in communication between conspecifics. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the production of intraspecific gestures taking into account the influence of multiple factors on gestural laterality: first, gestural characteristics (sensory modality, use of a communication tool, sharing degree in the population and duration); second, the interactional context (visual field and body sides of signaller and recipient, and emotional context); and third, individual sociodemographic characteristics of signaller and recipient (age, sex, group, hierarchy, affiliation and kinship). We questioned, first, whether gestural laterality differed with gesture at the population level and second, whether some factors influenced gestural laterality. To do so, we evaluated social laterality in dyadic interactions in 39 chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, living in three groups in captivity. We found that, at the population level, 13 of the 21 gestures we observed were performed predominantly with the right hand. Gestural laterality of signallers was influenced mainly by interactional context, gesture characteristics (except gesture duration) and signallers' hierarchical rank and age. Signallers used their hand ipsilateral to recipients for tactile and visual gestures and their contralateral hand for gestures involving auditory communication and a communication tool. Moreover, signallers' use of their right hand was more important for subordinates. This was also true in negative contexts for gestures common to most of the subjects. Our results further support the hypothesis that laterality in gestural communication might represent a precursor of the left-hemispheric lateralization of language. We discuss our results in relation to theories concerning the origins of cerebral hemispheric lateralization and their consistency with previous studies.

AB Animals are selective about when to learn by observing others. Models predict that social information becomes less reliable in uncertain environments, and therefore animals should reduce their use of social information in these environments; however, these parameters are often difficult to manipulate and control. We investigated how information reliability and environmental uncertainty affect the use of both social and nonsocial signals. Captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, were given a choice between two perches, one of which was rewarded. Jays could see either a social signal (a conspecific) or a nonsocial signal (a light) that provided some information about the rewarded perch. The nonsocial signal was yoked to the bird that generated the social signal, ensuring the two signals were of identical reliability. We manipulated signal reliability (i.e. the probability that the signal correctly indicated the rewarded perch) and environmental certainty (i.e. the probability that a given perch was rewarded). Qualitatively, jays used both social and nonsocial signals more often when the signals were reliable, and used them less often when environments were predictable. However, jays used social signals less than equally reliable nonsocial signals when environments were unpredictable. Our results suggest that signal reliability and environmental predictability interact to determine signal use, but they do not affect social and nonsocial signals in the same way.

AB Territorial animals settle territory disputes and discourage conspecific intrusion via close-range confrontations as well as nonconfrontational long-range signalling. Since individuals often differ consistently in general aggression and risk taking, the relative use of either close- or long-range territorial defence behaviour is likely to vary with the personality of the territory owner. Here we quantified the relationship between dawn song, a well-studied long-range signal, and responses to a close-range confrontation as well as how individuals in a territorial population vary in this relationship. For this we recorded dawn song and experimentally simulated territory intrusions via playbacks in wild personality-typed male great tits, Parus major. We show that males that sang at a higher rate at dawn also showed stronger vocal responses towards a simulated intruder, but spent less time in proximity to the intruder. Moreover, males with a higher exploration score, an established proxy for personality traits, showed the strongest vocal and spatial responses during the confrontation, yet exploration behaviour did not predict the dawn song rate. These findings highlight the importance of both confrontational and nonconfrontational territorial behaviours as well as personality for the social and territorial dynamics of animal populations.

AB Interactions with littermates are an important component of the early environment of altricial mammals, frequently with major consequence for individual development, growth and survival. Early differences in starting mass within litters are often predictive of individual differences in behaviour and development, although to what extent such differences are independent of (epi) genetic factors is not always clear. In our study on domestic rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, we created experimentally mixed litters consisting of either heavier or lighter pups obtained from different litters at birth and raised by foster mothers. We hypothesized that pups' body mass relative to their new littermates would determine the nature of their social interactions with consequences for their early growth, largely independent of their absolute or relative body mass in their litters of origin. As predicted, pups with a higher starting mass on postnatal day 1 compared to members of their new litter consistently had more neighbours in the litter huddle, thus reflecting their more central position. In turn, pups with more neighbours had relatively higher body temperatures, greater milk intake and a higher milk conversion ratio, resulting in relatively greater growth during the first critical postnatal week. Relative body mass in the litter of origin or absolute body mass had no notable effect, indicating that the observed developmental patterns were truly driven by pups' body mass relative to their current littermates rather than being a consequence of (epi) genetic effects potentially associated with their birth mass. In conclusion, our study underlines the importance of interactions among siblings in shaping individual differences in early growth and development largely independent of genetic factors.

AB Individuals gain valuable information by eavesdropping on others species' signals, but there are potentially greater constraints on eavesdropping than reception of signals from conspecifics. Eavesdroppers rely on signals addressed to others, which may come from unpredictable directions and distances. Furthermore, eavesdroppers might lack familiarity with other species' calls or perceptual adaptations to detect and recognize them, and these difficulties may be exacerbated by signal changes during transmission. We tested whether signal changes differentially affected the response to heterospecific compared with conspecific aerial ('hawk') alarm calls in two sympatric species that respond to each other's alarms, superb fairy-wrens, Malurus cyaneus, and white-browed scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis. We assessed the effects of signal attenuation (reduced amplitude) and degradation (including reverberation). Attenuation caused a reduction in probability of fleeing to cover, and birds were less likely to flee to heterospecific than conspecific alarms. Signal changes did affect the response to heterospecific compared to conspecific calls, but not in the simple way expected. For conspecifics, degradation had no effect, and attenuation caused a similar reduction in fleeing for degraded and undegraded calls. By contrast, for heterospecifics, attenuation caused a reduction in fleeing for undegraded but not degraded calls, which prompted constant, low fleeing rates. Additional measures of response suggest that a lower probability of fleeing was partly a consequence of poorer detection or recognition of calls, and not merely assessment of reduced danger. Overall, the results are consistent with greater constraints on heterospecific eavesdropping than conspecific communication, perhaps because of lower familiarity or perceptual specialization.

AB There is increasing evidence that learning processes contribute to variation in sexually selected traits, but their potential condition dependence is poorly understood. Birdsong is a learned, culturally transmitted mating signal where suboptimal developmental conditions impair song development, thus demonstrating that learned signals can show condition dependency. However, song learning is also contingent on conspecific song models, raising the question of potential synergistic effects of nutrition and social environment on song development. Zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, have been instrumental in testing how stressors experienced during the first month of life (i.e. before nutritional and social independence) affect song learning (developmental stress hypothesis). However, the critical phase for male song learning and female song preference learning is the second month of life, when juveniles start foraging independently and are joining larger social groups. This raises the question of how diet and peer group composition during this adolescent stage affect male song and female song preference development. To test these questions, postfledging juveniles were housed in peer groups of varying sex ratios and fed low or high-quality diets. Diet interacted with social conditions (sex ratio) in affecting male song rate and female song preferences but, foremost, the social environment shaped song and preference in previously unreported ways: despite the availability of an adult model, male song showed more similarity with the song of their former peers than with their respective tutor. Likewise, females, as adults, showed significant preferences for songs of their former peers over unfamiliar song but not for their respective tutor: the first demonstration of horizontal transmission of song preferences in female zebra finches. These results highlight how the quality of the rearing environment and social factors affect birdsong learning, contributing towards the growing evidence for developmental plasticity at different life stages of both mating traits and preferences.

AB The possible impacts of ocean acidification have gained substantial attention for their potential to alter physiological functioning of marine organisms. Less recognized are the present impacts of estuarine acidification, a widespread form of coastal acidification caused by terrestrial runoff and coastal current dynamics. We examined the effects of acidification (pH 8.0, 7.5 and 7.0) on the locomotory activity, respiration rate and foraging performance of a scavenging gastropod, Nassarius festivus, which relies on chemoreception to locate food sources. In addition, we assessed its ability to recover from exposure to acidified conditions, following 48 h at pH 8.0. The lowest pH conditions drove a greater proportion of individuals to retract into their shell, reduced respiration rate and resulted in worse foraging performance (i.e. lower travel speed during foraging, foraging success and consumption rate and longer feeding time). Nevertheless, individuals could recover from the effects of short-term acidification when the pH returned to normal. Overall, we demonstrated that foraging performance can be compromised by acidification, for which a global reduction in pH is set to force greater amplitudes of pH fluctuation, causing longer periods of acidification, shorter periods of recovery and potentially changing ecological roles such as nutrient recycling in coastal waters.

AB In social insects, the communication of social status helps individuals evaluate each other's reproductive potential, thus reducing conflict. Queens communicate their status through chemical signals, and the responses of workers to these signals include the suppression of ovarian activation. In most species of primitively social insects, dominant individuals indicate their status through aggressive behaviour, which also inhibits reproduction in workers. In some species, which lack queeneworker dimorphism, chemical signalling may act synergistically with agonistic interactions to establish the division of labour between females. Here, we investigated which mechanisms are involved in reproductive regulation in the orchid bee Euglossa melanotricha. Our long-term observations showed that dominant females monopolized egg laying and were able to recognize the eggs of subordinates. The overt aggression towards subordinates affected the egg-laying behaviour of these females but did not inhibit their ovarian development. We found that dominants maintained their monopoly on reproduction even after their experimental removal. When subordinates were removed, the productivity of the nest was reduced significantly, indicating clear benefits of the division of labour between females. We then analysed the chemical cuticular profile of the females and found that variation in the composition of hydrocarbons reflected the social status of the different individuals. The results of this study suggest that chemical signals evolved as honest signals and that workers restrain themselves from reproducing. This reduces reproductive options but increases selection pressures on the workers to obtain indirect fitness. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mother-pup vocal recognition abilities in pinnipeds reflect maternal reproductive strategies. In otariids, mother-pup pairs are frequently separated during lactation, pups are highly mobile at an early stage, and the high densities of colonies increase the risks of confusion between individuals. Accordingly, vocal recognition between mothers and pups is well developed in this group. In contrast, among phocids, the young are less mobile and mothers normally stay with their pups throughout lactation. Hence, the risks of confusion between individuals are relatively low and mother-young vocal recognition abilities are less developed in this family. Harbour seals, Phoca vitulina, are unique among phocids as females forage during lactation and pups are highly mobile throughout the 21-42-day nursing period. We performed playback experiments on 18 breeding female harbour seals to assess their abilities to recognize the calls of their pup and to evaluate the effect of maternal protectiveness and pup vocal stereotypy on the recognition process. In addition, we performed propagation tests to assess pup call propagation efficiency in the environment. As early as 3 days after birth, females were more responsive to calls of their own pup than to calls of nonfilial pups. Female responses also varied depending on their protective behaviour displayed towards their pup. Vocal discrimination abilities were positively correlated with the level of individuality conveyed in pup calls. Considerable differences in the propagation efficiency of pup calls were measured among sites used for mother-pup reunions. This study provides experimental evidence that wild harbour seal females recognize the calls of their pup among others, and that they memorize previous versions of their pup's calls, taking into account age- and size-related effects on vocalizations. Propagation tests further suggest that some mother-pup reunion sites are better suited for vocal recognition than others. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Among species with variable numbers of individuals contributing to offspring care, an individual's investment strategy should depend upon both the size of the breeding group and the relative contributions of each carer. Existing theoretical work on carer investment rules has, however, largely focused on biparental care, and on modelling offspring provisioning in isolation from other stages of investment. Consequently, there has been little exploration of how maternal investment prior to birth might be expected to influence carer provisioning decisions after birth, and how these should be modified by the number of carers present. In particular, it is unclear whether mothers should increase or decrease their investment in each offspring under favourable rearing conditions, and whether this differs under alternative assumptions about the consequences of being 'high quality' at birth. We develop a game-theoretical model of cooperative care that incorporates female control of prebirth investment, and allow increased maternal investment to either substitute for later investment (giving offspring a 'head start') or raise the value of later investment (a 'silver spoon'). We show that mothers reduce prebirth investment under better rearing conditions (more helpers) when investment is substitutable, leading to concealed helper effects. In contrast, when maternal prebirth investment primes offspring to benefit more from postbirth care, mothers should take advantage of good care environments by investing more in offspring both before and after birth. These results provide novel mechanisms to explain contrasting patterns of maternal investment across cooperative breeders. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Communication is a fundamental component of evolutionary change because of its role in mate choice and sexual selection. Acoustic signals are a vital element of animal communication and sympatric species may use private frequency bands to facilitate intraspecific communication and identification of conspecifics (acoustic communication hypothesis, ACH). If so, animals should show increasing rates of misclassification with increasing overlap in frequency between their own calls and those used by sympatric heterospecifics. We tested this on the echolocation of the horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus capensis, using a classical habituation-dishabituation experiment in which we exposed R. capensis from two phonetic populations to echolocation calls of sympatric and allopatric horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus clivosus and Rhinolophus damarensis) and different phonetic populations of R. capensis. As predicted by the ACH, R. capensis from both test populations were able to discriminate between their own calls and calls of the respective sympatric horseshoe bat species. However, only bats from one test population were able to discriminate between calls of allopatric heterospecifics and their own population when both were using the same frequency. The local acoustic signalling assemblages (ensemble of signals from sympatric conspecifics and heterospecifics) of the two populations differed in complexity as a result of contact with other phonetic populations and sympatric heterospecifics. We therefore propose that a hierarchy of discrimination ability has evolved within the same species. Frequency alone may be sufficient to assess species membership in relatively simple acoustic assemblages but the ability to use additional acoustic cues may have evolved in more complex acoustic assemblages to circumvent misidentifications as a result of the use of overlapping signals. When the acoustic signal design is under strong constraints as a result of dual functions and the available acoustic space is limited because of co-occurring species, species discrimination is mediated through improved sensory acuity in the receiver.

AB Several species besides humans respond negatively to inequity (i.e. receiving a less preferred outcome as compared to a social partner). Among primates, the taxon for which inequity responses have been most comprehensively studied, there are large individual differences in responses that have, thus far, not been well explained by demographic features such as sex, rank and age. Recent evidence shows that individuals' personalities are important in explaining differences in behavioural outcomes in other contexts. Thus, in the current study, we explored whether personality was associated with chimpanzees' responses to both inequity and contrast (i.e. receiving less than anticipated). Chimpanzees were paired with multiple members of their social groups. These pairs alternated trading a token to receive food rewards that either differed from what their partner received (inequity condition) or from what was initially offered (contrast condition) and we compared their responses to a control in which both subjects were offered and received the same reward for trading the token. We predicted that both personality and the quality and length of the pairs' relationship would influence subjects' reactions to unequal outcomes, as measured by their refusal to exchange tokens. The quality of subjects' relationships, based on a weighted average of grooming, contact and proximity, did not correlate with refusals to exchange, whereas pairs that had lived together longer were less likely to refuse in the contrast condition than were pairs that had lived together for less time. Considering personality, some of the dimensions influenced responses to both inequity and contrast similarly, but the more 'social' personality dimensions ('extraversion' and 'agreeableness') were more strongly correlated with sensitivity to inequity. These results highlight the importance of considering individual differences, including personality, when evaluating responses in cognitive and behavioural tests.

AB Prey consumption depends on the predator's ability to locate, capture and handle prey. We investigated these three steps in interactions between the delicate-bodied recluse spider Loxosceles gaucho (Araneae) and a heavy-bodied and armoured harvestman, Mischonyx cuspidatus (Opiliones). Although previous research suggested that the hard integument of such harvestmen protects them from being preyed upon by spiders larger than Loxosceles, indirect evidence suggested that Loxosceles spiders can subdue these prey. In the present study, we tested the following three hypotheses with regard to L. gaucho: (1) spiders use chemical cues left by prey to select foraging sites; (2) vibratory cues of prey are essential information in the predatory process; and (3) the spider's web sheet allows adequate handling of prey so vulnerable body regions of the prey can be bitten. To understand how a delicate predator can overcome the defences of a heavy-bodied and well-defended prey, we also quantitatively described the spider's behaviour. To test hypothesis 1, we compared the time spent in areas with harvestmen, crickets and no cues. For hypothesis 2, we compared latency to bite and number of bites in the presence or absence of vibratory information, and for hypothesis 3, we compared latency to detect prey, latency to capture prey and predation success. All three hypotheses were rejected. Loxosceles gaucho seems to be exceptional among spiders by not needing its web, indirect prey chemical cues, or prey's substrate borne vibrations to hunt the tested prey. What enables L. gaucho to prey upon M. cuspidatus is its unique hunting strategy, compared to previously studied spiders: it touches the prey with its tarsi possibly to locate weak parts of the prey's body, such as joints and distal parts of the legs, then it delivers several bites to these vulnerable areas. Our study is the first to document and describe how recluse spiders overcome the defences of an armoured harvestman. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Despite the potential benefits of modifying behaviour according to changing ecological conditions, many populations comprise individuals that differ consistently in behaviour across situations, contexts and points in time (i.e. individuals show personality). If personalities are adaptive, the balance between consistency and flexibility of behavioural traits should reflect the ability of individuals to detect and respond to changing conditions in an appropriate and timely manner and, thus, depend upon the pace and predictability of changing conditions. We investigated the balance between individual consistency and flexibility in the subsocial spider Anelosimus studiosus by assaying boldness across the diel cycle and correlating these data with patterns of prey and threat abundance in the natural habitat. We found significant diel flexibility in boldness correlating with drastic and predictable changes in prey availability. Moreover, the strength of within-individual flexibility in boldness was comparable to the strength of rank-order consistency among individuals. We also found evidence that mean boldness level and among-individual variation in boldness are correlated with reproductive status. These data emphasize the interplay between behavioural consistency and flexibility and suggest that temporal characteristics of ecological conditions may be vital in assessing the strength, stability and adaptive value of animal personalities.

AB It has been proposed that leks arise because of increased mating benefits in aggregations of displaying males, and some evidence supports this hypothesis. But observations also indicate that lekking aggregations include only a small percentage of the males in a population, implying that certain factors limit lek size. Potential factors include increasing travel costs to find and form large but distant aggregations, greater attraction of predators and higher levels of aggression. Any one of these constraints may cause the number of females arriving at larger leks to decelerate such that per capita male attractiveness, and hence mating success, declines above an optimum lek size. None the less, relatively little empirical work has examined what determines lek size. In particular the possibility that cognitive aspects might constrain lek size has rarely been considered. We studied this question in Achroia grisella, an acoustic moth in which singing males form small aggregations that attract females. We created artificial leks in the laboratory and tested their relative attractiveness to females; we also tested male preferences to form and join such aggregations. Females preferred male aggregations over solitary singers, but the marginal per capita attractiveness of an aggregation of n + 2 males versus n males waned for n >= 5. Similarly we found that males were attracted to other males singing in the vicinity, but this effect disappeared for n >= 4. We infer that lek size is limited because the marginal per capita attractiveness of larger leks only occurs for small groups. This constraint probably arises because females distinguish leks by overall song rate but are neuroethologically incapable of discriminating rates above a threshold value corresponding to groups of four to six males. These findings emphasize the critical role that neural constraints may play in determining fundamental parameters of complex behaviours such as lekking.

AB Communication via substrate vibrations can convey information on conspecific presence, individual quality, group cohesion and/or allow for predator avoidance. Although studies have identified that various species use this modality, few studies on mammalian taxa have investigated whether the information contained in substrate vibrations is a reliable indicator of resource-holding potential (RHP). The grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, breeding colony at Donna Nook, U.K., is part of a limited geographical region where the Body Slap (BS) behaviour is performed during male-male conflicts. This behaviour is thought to have a mechanical component. We examined whether the magnitude of the BS substrate vibrations contained reliable information on male mass and size as measures of RHP, and whether reliability varied across environmental conditions. To test this, we deployed seismometers during the breeding season that recorded continuous seismic data over a frequency bandwidth of 0.03-500 Hz. Locations and times of BS events performed by individual males were recorded, matched with the seismic data, and a distance-corrected magnitude was calculated for each event. Our results demonstrate the BS generates a stereotyped seismic signature measurable up to 126.3 m away. We found a positive correlation between the maximum and mean magnitudes of the substrate-borne vibrations and a male's length. Dampness of the sand substrate had no effect on magnitude. Results of this study confirm that the maximum magnitude substrate vibrations generated by the BS behaviour is an indicator of male size and that the substrate-borne vibrations are reliable across varying environmental conditions.

AB In most mammals, male-male contests over access to resources select for males to be larger, more aggressive and better armed than females. However, the functional significance of male-male aggression has been little studied in sex-role-reversed species, such as spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta. This species has highly aggressive, socially dominant females, to which male access cannot be directly improved by fighting. Here, we first demonstrated that males nevertheless display intrasexual aggression at rates similar to rates of intrasexual aggression displayed by adult females. We then tested three hypotheses suggesting functions of this aggression among males. Males aggressed significantly less in the presence of an adult female than when adult females were absent, suggesting that they do not use aggression to prevent other males from remaining in close proximity to females. New immigrants received significantly more aggression from other immigrants than did established immigrants, but new and established immigrants were treated equally by adult natal males. These results supported a hypothesis suggesting that male-male aggression functions to restrict clan membership, although the data indicated that immigrants, not adult natal males, engage in aggression for this reason. Finally, a hypothesis suggesting that this behaviour functions to provide access to food was supported by data showing that male-male aggression occurred significantly more frequently, and at higher intensities, in the presence than the absence of food. In contrast to male-male contests in most mammals, those in spotted hyaenas appear to increase a male's access to females only indirectly, which is presumably due to the sex-role-reversed nature of social dominance in spotted hyaenas.

AB Adopting different behavioural strategies may reduce within-group conflict, selecting for behavioural consistency ('personality'). Personality may also affect grouping tendencies. The relationship between the personality dimensions sociability and boldness nevertheless remains unclear. This knowledge gap may reflect a failure to consider potential trade-offs between avoiding conspecifics, potentially alleviating social stress, and avoiding predation. Furthermore, the effects of personality and state (e.g. body condition or age affecting the costs and benefits of behavioural actions) on cooperativeness should be considered together. This is because state may explain predation vulnerability, which may affect boldness under predation risk, and thus antipredator grouping tendencies. To address the problem, we determined how group size preference and group-forming time depended on boldness (flight initiation distance, FID, in response to an approaching human), body condition and breeding experience in facultatively social eiders, Somateria mollissima, where females form coalitions or care for the young solitarily. Breeding adults and young are subject to high predation pressure, providing a strong incentive for brood-tending females to cooperate. Because hormonal differences may also explain differences in sociability, we included baseline and handling-induced serum corticosterone concentrations of incubating females as potential predictors of sociability. We also statistically controlled for availability of potential partners. The relationship between boldness (FID) and the number of coalition partners ranged from negative (females in poor body condition) to positive (females in good body condition), arguing against a uniform relationship between boldness and sociability. The number of coalition partners decreased with female breeding experience. The time taken to form a coalition was shortest close to the hatching peak in the population. Shyness (long FID) delayed group formation. Despite a need for safety in numbers by shy females in poor body condition, their entry into groups may be constrained by their personality, suggesting a possible trade-off between predator and conspecific avoidance.

AB Many animals use extended phenotypes to attract mates, but the availability of suitable resources in the environment can affect the size and form of these signals, with unknown consequences for honest signalling. In some populations of the great bowerbird, Ptilonorhynchus nuchalis, males arrange decorations by size, with smaller decorations placed closer to the bower entrance than larger decorations. This may create a more even background pattern from the female's viewpoint within the bower than if decorations were arranged randomly. Males show consistent, individual variation in the size-distance gradient, which could reflect variation among males in the cognitive skills needed to arrange decorations. We examined whether individual consistency in gradient characteristics is related to a male's skill at decoration arrangement or the types of decorations at bowers. We paired 18 males and switched bower decorations between pairs. We measured gradient characteristics before switching and 4 and 8 days after switching. Gradient characteristics after switching were related to those of the bower from which decorations were received, not to those of the male's own bower before switching. Gradient characteristics were also related to the types of decorations received, including bones and snail shells. These results suggest that variation among males in the size-distance gradient is explained by differences in the availability of decorations at bowers, not the cognitive skills required to arrange decorations. Although variation in gradient characteristics could indicate the male's ability to locate and transport particular decorations, it could also reflect local availability of objects, with no relationship to male quality.

AB Sex-biased dispersal can reduce kin cooperation and kin competition in the dispersed sex. However, this may not be the case when group-living animals engage in parallel dispersal, which occurs when an individual transfers between groups together with other animals or immigrates alone into a group that contains familiar animals. Despite this potential effect on kin cooperation and competition, few studies have thoroughly investigated how parallel dispersal affects the kin composition of groups. To further our understanding of this topic, we investigated the effect of parallel dispersal on access to coresident kin in male white-faced capuchins, Cebus capucinus. Between 2006 and 2013, we collected demographic and genetic data from two to five groups in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. We genotyped 41 females and 39 males at 14 short tandem repeat loci, and we calculated their estimated relatedness values. The majority of males dispersed in parallel, and parallel dispersing males were more closely related to one another than were other males. Parallel immigrant males and natal females resided with a similar number of same-sex kin. Single immigrant males in multimale groups rarely resided with male kin, and they resided with fewer same-sex kin than did parallel immigrant males and natal females. Because parallel dispersal offers an opportunity for males to form long-lasting cooperative relationships with familiar kin, this dispersal pattern should be taken into account in future models of the evolution of social structure.

AB We describe and evaluate an integrative hypothesis for the origin and evolution of human religious cognition and behaviour, based on maximization of inclusive fitness. By this hypothesis, the concept of God is represented by one's circle of kin and social salience, such that serving God and serving this circle become synonymous. The theory is supported by data from anthropology, evolutionary theory, psychology, neuroscience, psychiatry, endocrinology and genetics. It is largely compatible with, yet can subsume, previous theories of religion that are also based on adaptation and natural selection. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behavioural traits can vary between individuals from the same population. These differences can involve consistent variation in the level of a particular behaviour (personality) or differences in the way individuals adjust their behaviour to environmental gradients (plasticity). In prey species, feeding rates and vigilance vary with environmental, social and individual factors and the feeding rate/vigilance relationship reflects the trade-off between food acquisition and safety. While feeding rates and vigilance have been shown to vary between individuals in relation to group size and predation risk, how they relate to other factors has not yet been investigated, nor has between-individual variation in this trade-off. We studied between-individual variation in vigilance, feeding rates and their trade-off in female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, to see whether females showed consistent behavioural differences and different plasticity in relation to ecological (food patch richness), social (group sizes) and physiological (reproductive states) conditions. We addressed two contrasting hypotheses: an 'ecological' hypothesis under which individuals facing the same conditions should behave similarly, and a 'behavioural' hypothesis under which they should behave differently because of their own personality or plasticity. Female kangaroos tended to adjust their behaviours similarly in relation to ecological and social conditions, supporting the ecological hypothesis. However, they also showed differences in personality and plasticity in relation to their reproductive states that could not be explained by energetic demand alone; this was suggestive of different maternal strategies, thus supporting the behavioural hypothesis. Altogether these results suggest that consistent differences in animals' personality and behavioural plasticity can be promoted by physiological conditions and are not necessarily repeatable across different ecological contexts.

AB Foraging innovations are increasingly viewed as a key source of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change. Often thought to be associated with increased cognitive abilities, innovative foraging behaviour could potentially emerge as a simple consequence of being able to use a greater variety of motor actions in the foraging context. Here, we explored the role of motor diversity in the innovative problem-solving abilities of a highly successful ecological invader, the Indian myna, Sturnus tristis, using an extractive foraging task with multiple compartments. Consistent with findings from several other species, persistence predicted the latency to solve the first compartment. However, motor diversity was the strongest predictor of both solving latency of all further compartments and number of compartments solved. We suggest that motor diversity may facilitate innovation by increasing the ways in which objects can be handled, which in turn would allow for associative learning processes to enhance the expression of successful foraging behaviours.

AB Fitness costs associated with brood parasitism have led host species to evolve several lines of defence. The first two lines of defence, aggression against adult parasites and egg rejection, are present at varying levels in almost all hosts. However, it remains unclear how these two fundamental defences covary at host individual level, with previous studies suggesting both positive and negative correlations. A theoretically critical yet empirically untested scenario is that variation in host antiparasite behaviour may relate to individual variation in host behavioural types or personalities. Here we examined whether host aggression against adult brood parasites and egg rejection behaviour were correlated with host behaviours displayed outside the context of brood parasitism. We selected the great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, a favourite cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, host as a suitable model. Only females reject foreign eggs and show high individual repeatability of both aggression towards cuckoos and nest guarding. We found that female behaviours in different situations (nest guarding, nest defence, handling in the net) were strongly correlated with each other. This is the first empirical evidence on correlation between individually consistent antiparasite adaptation (female nest defence) and behaviours that are not directly related to brood parasitism. In contrast, egg rejection/acceptance responses and latency to these responses did not correlate with any of the female defence/guarding behaviours and behaviour during handling. Proximately, this may be because nest defence and egg recognition represent cognitively and behaviourally completely different tasks. These patterns were not affected by female mating status in this polygynous cuckoo host. We hypothesize that differences in host behavioural types, rather than host egg discrimination ability, may predict host nest defence behaviour against adult brood parasites in general.

AB During courtship interactions, males typically perform displays that are assumed to demonstrate some aspect of their quality. While some displays are elaborate and spectacular in appearance, others involve comparatively simple repetitive actions. The functions of these dynamic repeated courtship displays are hypothesized to fall into two broad categories. Either the signal is repeated as a process of validation to counter errors in transmission, or the process of repetition itself advertises the ability to bear signalling costs. The function of any repetitive courtship display can thus be identified by investigating the nature of production costs as well as the pattern of repetition. In the present study, I investigated the function of signal repetition using a commonly used organism, the Mediterranean field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. Male G. bimaculatus court females by producing acoustic signals using rapid, repeated movements of their wings. I tested for the presence of energetic costs by analysing haemolymph lactate concentrations after time-controlled courtship interactions. Males that had performed 5 min of courtship were found to have higher levels of haemolymph lactate relative to controls. Furthermore, those individuals producing more rapid song had higher levels of haemolymph lactate. The song produced by courting crickets therefore incurs significant energetic costs, and probably serves to advertise the energetic cost capacity of the calling male. Thus, I confirm that stridulation is an energetically costly signal and demonstrate that anaerobic metabolism appears to be a significant cost of repeated courtship displays.

AB Variation in sexual behaviour has both genetic (no experience or social contact needed) and environmental (based on individual experience) components. Within species, males can maximize their fitness during inter-and intrasexual selection in a variety of ways. This may lead to evolution of alternative male mating behaviours resulting in a dichotomy between courting/guarding and sneaking tactics. We used Endler's guppies to investigate (1) whether individual sexually naive males have a preferred mating tactic (courting or sneaking), and (2) how male mating behaviour is affected by recent social history (male-or female-biased social environment). We found that individual males approached females by either courting or sneaking, even with no previous sexual experience. We further demonstrated that male sexual behaviour in standardized mating trials was strongly affected following exposure to a sex-biased social environment for 5 weeks. Males from female-biased social environments showed decreased mating effort overall compared to the baseline level (measured prior to assignment to a social environment treatment) but were more likely to court females rather than attempt sneak copulations. Males from male-biased social environments maintained a high level of mating effort and increased the rate of sneaking attempts compared to courtship displays. Our study highlights that both genetic and environmental sources of variation contribute to individual sexual behaviour. Current sexual behaviour was strongly modulated by recent social history, underpinning the importance of previous experience in the expression of sexual behaviour.

AB In some species, populations with the highest average aggressiveness also have the lowest sociability, suggesting a conflict between the expression of these behaviours. While this negative relationship has been found between populations, whether the same relationship can be found within a population, where the most aggressive individuals are also the least social ones, has not been tested in vertebrates. In the present study, we found a negative correlation between aggressiveness and sociability in only one of two populations of juvenile threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, reared in a common environment. Nevertheless, highly aggressive individuals that were also highly social were absent in both populations. Our results suggest that specific constraints or selection pressures resulted in the absence of this behaviour combination in both populations. Our findings also suggest that population-specific selection pressures may have resulted in the negative correlation present in only one population, although an effect of genetic drift or population-specific maternal effects are also possible. Our results do not support the hypothesis that this correlation was due to genetic constraints. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Female space use can have important fitness consequences, which are likely due to differential access to food resources. Many studies have explored spatial competition in solitary species, but little is known about how individuals in social species compete over shared space. In this study, we investigate spatial patterns of aggression among female East African chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii. This species provides an excellent opportunity to study spatial competition since (1) female chimpanzees occupy overlapping core areas (small areas of the community range in which individuals concentrate their space use) and (2) female core area quality is correlated with reproductive success, suggesting that females compete over long-term access to core areas. Here, we examine how female aggression towards other females varies inside and outside individual female core areas during a 14-year period at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Overall, females showed higher rates of aggression inside than outside their own core areas. This pattern was driven by spatial variation in aggression in nonfeeding contexts. While food-related aggression did not vary spatially, females were more aggressive in nonfeeding contexts inside their core areas than they were outside their core areas. These results suggest that female chimpanzees follow a mixed strategy in which they compete for long-term access to resources in their core areas as well as for immediate access to food throughout the community range.

AB Dominance hierarchies in groups of social animals can be based either on asymmetries that are important for agonistic interactions (such as body mass) or on more 'conventional' cues (such as age), which are respected despite having little relationship to the animal's fighting abilities. We investigated how social dominance is influenced by age and body mass in a herd of 29-39 beef cows over a 10-year period, focusing on all levels of the dominance hierarchy (individual, dyadic and group). The results demonstrate that age prevails over body mass in the structuring of the dominance network in beef cattle. At the individual level, path analysis confirmed that the dominance index of a cow was more strongly associated with her age than with her body mass. At the dyadic level, age superiority had a stronger influence on the direction of social dominance in pairs than body mass superiority. Older cows were dominant in 73.6% of those dyads studied, even when the younger cow was heavier. At the group level, the strong influence of age on dominance produced a hierarchy that was very stable and strongly transitive. Our findings show that beef cows, for the most part, do not use their physical strength to attain dominance over older, but lighter, herdmates. This results in a stable age-based hierarchy, which might serve a universally shared function that promotes the smooth functioning of the herd and/or the expression of experience by older cows. Among the theoretical models of conflict resolution, the system most closely resembles the partial bourgeois evolutionarily stable strategy. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB Positive feedback in communication is central to the emergence of collective behaviour in animal groups. The nonlinearity hypothesis predicts that group behaviour will be defined in large part by the degree of cooperative interaction in this feedback. Strong interactions mean that the effectiveness of communication grows nonlinearly with signal quantity, leading to robust spatial patterning and consensus decision making. These predictions have been supported in many experimental systems, but the corresponding behaviour of linear systems, where signal effectiveness is proportional to signal quantity, has not been well explored. We examined the consequences of tandem running, a linear method of recruitment, for collective decision making by foraging colonies of the ant Temnothorax rugatulus. We found that colonies collectively chose the better of two unequal feeders, but they allocated foragers equally when feeders were identical. This result accords with theoretical predictions and contrasts with symmetry breaking seen in species with highly nonlinear trail pheromone recruitment. Colonies were also able to reallocate foragers when the quality of two unequal feeders was switched, again in accord with theoretical expectations. We built a model based upon the behaviour of individual ants and found that colony-level qualities of choice, allocation and flexibility can be predicted by two behaviours: quality-dependent linear recruitment and quality-dependent attrition. These experiments are the first thorough investigation of the consequences of linear recruitment for collective animal behaviour. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many of the mechanisms advanced to explain the evolution of intraspecific cooperative behaviour, such as reciprocity or social prestige, hinge on an animal's ability to recognize individual group members. However, 'true' individual recognition, between adult group members, has never been demonstrated in a cooperatively breeding bird or mammal species. We tested whether a wild cooperative mammal, the dwarf mongoose, Helogale parvula, could recognize individual group members from their vocalizations. We provided test subjects with a large, desirable food item and then simulated the approach of another group member using playbacks of its contact calls. Mongooses were more vigilant after hearing the calls of individuals of higher rank than themselves (that could steal their food) compared with individuals of lower rank than themselves (that could not). We showed that the mongooses were not simply responding to age-related cues that conveyed potential information on rank, and provide some evidence that they were associating the unique characteristics of the call with an individually specific characteristic of the caller (i.e. its relative rank). We conclude that dwarf mongooses exhibit 'true' individual recognition, and this finding supports the potential validity of mechanisms that rely on individuals monitoring the behaviour of others to explain the evolution of cooperative behaviour.

AB Foraging bumblebees focus mainly on one flower species (their 'major'), and occasionally visit other flowers ('minors') that are less rewarding. Minoring allows tracking of potential alternative resources that might become more profitable with time. This is expected to provide an adaptive benefit under unstable foraging conditions, but to reduce foraging efficiency when resources are steady. We tested how predictability of food sources affects minoring and foraging success, using Bombus terrestris workers that fed on sucrose solution in artificial flowers. Bees exposed to three colour-distinct flower types with fluctuating food rewards performed more minoring (visits to a fourth, nonrewarding flower type) than bees that encountered a stable reward schedule. This difference was mostly due to a higher frequency of flower type shifts in the fluctuating-reward treatment. Flowers of the highest-rewarding type were visited less frequently in the fluctuating-reward than in the stable-reward treatment. This suggests that the fluctuating-reward schedule limited the bees' ability to track the most profitable flower type. Intervals between successive visits were longer in the fluctuating-reward than in the stable-reward treatment, possibly because the fluctuating schedule required time-consuming neural processing. As expected, the number of minoring visits correlated negatively with the number of colour shifts and with foraging success in the stable-reward treatment. In the fluctuating-reward treatment, on the other hand, sucrose intake rates were independent of minoring and colour shift frequencies. We suggest that novelty seeking by foragers can evolve when food sources offer fluctuating rewards, which reduce foraging success but also the cost of exploring new resources.

AB Migration evolves as a response to seasonally unfavourable environments but plasticity in reproductive physiology is another avenue by which insects can respond to resource-poor conditions. We investigated the relationship between individual variation in migratory propensity and the level of response to poor conditions modulated by the female reproductive physiology. We tested the hypothesis that, compared to migrants, residential behaviour is associated with a higher degree of phenotypic plasticity in oosorption, an adaptive physiological mechanism that allows females to recoup resources from undeveloped oocytes. Reallocation from reproduction to survival would allow females to skip migration and to cope with unfavourable environments. If this plasticity is evolved, we further predicted it would vary between as well as within populations. We examined variation associated with migratory behaviour in females from four populations of the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, using a behavioural assay to categorize females as either migrant or resident and observing the differences in oosorption between these groups. As expected, food availability, source population and wing length influenced the propensity for migratory flight, and food availability influenced levels of oosorption. We also found support for our key prediction that resident females are characterized by higher levels of ovarian oosorption than migrant females. Our study provides support for a physiological difference between migrant and resident females and suggests the presence of both physiological and behavioural tactics that interact with the potential for migration to provide adaptation to seasonally challenging environments.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

   coloration
ID PREY; INTIMIDATION; SURVIVAL
AB Many lepidopteran caterpillars appear to gain protection from insect-eating birds because they possess eyespots, a pair of conspicuous markings on the body generally thought to resemble the eyes of a predator. Similarly, many caterpillars widen their anterior body segments when threatened, and this defensive posture may also deter attack because it emphasizes the caterpillar's eyes and/or allows the caterpillar to resemble a snake more closely. Yet, given that this behaviour is not limited to caterpillars with eyespots, it is possible that the defensive posture may serve as a predator deterrent in itself. To disentangle the protective value of eyespots and widened anterior body segments, we created four types of artificial caterpillar in a 2x2 factorial design and deployed them on tree branches in the field where they were exposed to predation attempts by wild birds. The 'survivorship' of the artificial caterpillars was monitored over 90 h in six locations. We found a clear survival advantage for artificial prey with eyespots or a widened head shape. However, prey possessing both eyespots and a widened head did not survive longer than prey with either characteristic alone, suggesting that the traits did not act synergistically to deter attack. Interestingly though, only caterpillars in the eyespot-defensive posture treatment received more pecks directed towards the anterior 'head' region. Collectively, this study demonstrates clearly that caterpillars possessing either eyespots or widened anterior body segments are likely to experience reduced predation by wild birds, even at northern latitudes where there are relatively few arboreal snakes.

AB The regulation of oxidative status is critical because fluctuations in the production of aerobic by-products relative to the antioxidant capacity of the organism can have strong fitness consequences. Towards this end, organisms can use endogenous antioxidant defences, which are efficient at combating oxidative attacks but may be costly and need time to be activated. As food items vary in their antioxidant content, animals have the possibility to optimize their oxidative status, rapidly and at a low cost, by selecting food in their environment according to its antioxidant content. However, the actual role of dietary antioxidants remains contentious because their consumption entails inconsistent effects. We propose that this inconsistency stems from the lack of methodical examination of the cost-benefit ratio related to antioxidant intake, which should reflect the actual need for antioxidants by organisms. We apply the framework of self-medication to the regulation of oxidative status, which necessarily implies assessing the physiological needs of consumers. We formulate conditions under which self-medication is likely to occur, and show that most conditions are met for the regulation of oxidative stress. Linking self-medication to oxidative ecology therefore provides a novel mechanistic framework on how oxidative stress can be regulated; it highlights the transient nature of food selection upon the regulation of oxidative status, and thereby shows why indiscriminant supplementation of dietary antioxidants is likely to be misguided.

AB Social structure in group-living animals is defined by the nature and patterning of social interactions among members of the society. Social structure is shaped in large part by kinship and competition among group members, but can also be influenced by affiliative interactions among both kin and nonkin and can vary based on sex differences in dispersal patterns and social dynamics. Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, live in fission-fusion societies in which males form strong dyadic bonds and have social networks that can influence the social structure of the community. Females are generally less gregarious than males and bonding among females is considered rare or absent in East African populations. Although females in some populations are known to form 'neighbourhoods', these are assumed to reflect passive spatial arrangements. In this study I used data on female chimpanzee association and social interactions to examine how social dynamics among the dispersing sex influence social structure at Ngogo, Kibale National Park. Females at Ngogo were relatively gregarious and exhibited association preferences that extended beyond the dyadic level. Females formed distinct association clusters termed 'cliques' within which affiliative interactions occurred more than expected by chance. In addition, association patterns were found to be active social units and not a by-product of space use overlap. These findings demonstrate that intrasexual bonding is not limited to males in this population and that female social relationships, not just those of males, can influence chimpanzee grouping patterns and the corresponding social structure of the community. This study contributes to our growing understanding chimpanzee behavioural diversity. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Between-group contest competition and the relative importance of male resource defence have recently been suggested to have been previously underestimated. When males contribute to the defence of group-controlled resources, the quality of the home range may depend on the resource-holding potential of resident males. Among Argentine tufted capuchin monkeys, resident males defend access to high-quality food resources. Here I investigate consequences of this male-male cooperation for intergroup dominance relationships and home range quality. I recorded ranging behaviour for four habituated groups in Iguazu National Park to identify home ranges and core areas, and measured the availability of food species within botanical plots placed in these areas. I recorded the location and outcome of intergroup encounters and fitted predictive models using generalized estimating equations to assess the relative importance of male group size and location on the outcome, before performing linear mixed-effects modelling to identify long-term benefits of winning encounters. Relative male group size was the most important factor in determining the winner of encounters, outweighing the competitive advantage of ownership. The density of food species within the core area was not affected by the group's competitive ability, but core area size increased with male group size. Moreover, dominant groups were better able to defend their core area, and adjusting for the degree of home range overlap revealed that dominant groups may have higher per capita access to food. These results suggest that male-male cooperation in defence of food resources could ultimately increase female reproductive success. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A key issue in animal behaviour is the need to understand variation in behavioural responses to human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC) such as habitat loss, exotic species, pollution, human harvesting and climate change. Why do some individuals show maladaptive behaviours, while others show adaptive responses to evolutionarily novel situations? At present, we lack a unified conceptual framework for generating predictions and guiding empirical and theoretical work on this critical question. Drawing from the concept of ecological traps, I suggest that a conceptual framework for explaining this variation should include four main points: (1) behavioural responses (adaptive or not) are the result of cueeresponse systems, or behavioural 'rules of thumb'; (2) limited or imprecise, unreliable information often underlies suboptimal behaviour; (3) the organism's behavioural flexibility affects its response to novel situations; and (4) evolution (and development) in past environments has shaped cueeresponse systems, responses to imperfect information and degree of behavioural flexibility to be adaptive in past environments, but not necessarily in novel environments. The degree of match/mismatch between past environments and novel environments altered by HIREC is thus a key to explaining adaptive versus maladaptive behaviours. I suggest several existing frameworks that address these four points, and are thus potentially useful for explaining behavioural responses to HIREC: signal detection theory, adaptive plasticity theory, extended reaction norms and cost-benefit theory on variation in learning. I further discuss more complex aspects of reality that would be useful to add to these existing frameworks. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many species exhibit fission-fusion dynamics, yet the factors that influence the frequent changes in group size and membership in these species have not been widely studied. Social ties may be influenced by kinship but animals may also form preferred associations because of social attraction or may only associate because they have similar habitat preferences. We investigated the association patterns of 535 wild giraffes, Giraffa camelopardalis, in Etosha National Park, Namibia using behavioural and genetic data from individually identified giraffes. We collected 726 records of group composition over a 14-month period and calculated pairwise association indices, which were tested against a null model. We found that female-female pairs, but not male-male pairs, showed both preferred and avoided relationships. We tested whether females' relationships could be explained by the degree of relatedness between pairs and whether pairs overlapped spatially. Correlations between matrices of pairwise associations, spatial overlap and relatedness showed that female-female associations were strongly correlated with amounts of spatial overlap and pairs that exhibited preferred relationships were more closely related than would be expected by chance. However, only about one-quarter of the variation in observed associations could be explained by spatial overlap and relatedness and therefore much of this variation may have been related to individual social preferences.

AB Social assortativity, preferentially associating with certain individuals, is a widespread behaviour among a diverse range of taxa. Animals often choose to associate with other individuals based on characteristics such as sex, age, body size, rank and genetic relatedness. These preferences can scale up to shape the overall social structure of an animal group or population. We investigated possible factors that might shape the social network structure of common racoons, Procyon lotor, in a high-density urban population in Cook County, Illinois, U. S. A. Racoon associations were recorded using proximity detecting radiocollars that recorded when individuals came within 1-1.5 m of each other. In addition, dyadic measures of home range overlap and genetic relatedness were calculated for all individuals included in our study. We used multiple regression quadratic assignment procedures to determine what factors influenced the structure of racoon association networks. The only variable that positively influenced racoon social structure was male-male homophily, which is consistent with previous studies that documented frequent social interactions between adult male racoons. Genetic relatedness had no effect on racoon social networks and there was no evidence that males or females preferentially associated with close relatives, despite the presence of kin in the population. This pattern, that kinship does not play a significant role in shaping social structure, is strikingly unusual among mammals and is not consistent with many socioecological models. Although racoon individuals showed strong social partner preferences, it is unclear what factors drove these choices. This unpredictability in partner choice shaped the structure of the racoon social networks and has important implications for disease transfer in this widespread animal vector.

AB Adults that cannibalize juvenile conspecifics gain substantial energy and nutrients that are potentially limited in their normal diet, but they may also face the risk of filial cannibalism: the consumption of an individual's own offspring. However, the potential costs and benefits of cannibalism change with the reproductive status of an individual during its lifetime. Once adults become reproductively active, they suddenly face the potential loss of inclusive fitness associated with filial cannibalism, but they also have higher energy demands that could easily be met with cannibalism. Thus, selection should favour any behaviour that reduces the risk of filial cannibalism while maximizing the nutritional and other benefits of cannibalism. Here we take an experimental approach to examine the relative importance of kin discrimination, reproductive status and sex differences in influencing cannibalistic behaviour (including filial cannibalism) of adults using confused flour beetles, Tribolium confusum, as a model system. Using a series of complementary experiments, we show that the cannibalistic behaviour of T. confusum is driven by a combination of two factors that both reduce the risk of filial cannibalism. First, reproductive females preferred to cannibalize unrelated eggs over related eggs, indicating clear kin discrimination. In addition, females also showed a dramatic reduction in the general propensity for cannibalism after becoming reproductively active. Interestingly, the onset of reproduction also reduced cannibalism rates in males, indicating that this change in cannibalistic behaviour is consistent across sexes. Mating status had a greater influence on cannibalism rates than did sex. Together, kin discrimination and mating-status-dependent shifts in cannibalism rates reduced the risk of filial cannibalism by up to six- fold. In general, our findings suggest that evolution can alter the cannibalistic behaviour of individuals in multiple ways to reduce the risk of filial cannibalism while still maximizing the benefits of cannibalism.

AB Mating with relatives leads to inbred offspring, which are likely to experience reduced fitness owing to the expression of deleterious recessive alleles. Constraints in social mate choice do not always allow individuals to avoid pairing with kin. A possible means of inbreeding avoidance is to engage in extrapair copulations with unrelated extrapair individuals. In a population of great tits, Parus major, we tested whether broods of related partners were characterized by higher rates of extrapair paternity than neighbouring outbred broods. Contrary to our expectations, broods sired by related partners had about 60% lower rates of extrapair paternity relative to outbred broods. Parental status of female birds categorized as inbreeding, outbreeding locally born or outbreeding immigrant explained 29% of the variance in the proportion of extrapair young in their broods. Outbreeding locally born females and inbreeding females did not differ in rates of extrapair paternity, but had significantly fewer extrapair young than outbreeding immigrant females. Thus, the contrasting differences in the proportion of extrapair young in inbred and outbred great tit broods do not appear to be the consequence of inbreeding per se. Instead, variation in both promiscuity and inbreeding may reflect the operation of broad-scale effects caused by variation in large-scale dispersal behaviour.

AB Nutritional conditions experienced during early growth have important implications for the lifetime fitness of herbivores in nutritionally heterogeneous environments. We investigated the early life effects of imbalanced nutrient intake on key fitness components and how such effects can be overcome in a generalist leaf-feeding lepidopteran caterpillar, Spodoptera litura. Over the fifth larval instar, caterpillars were pretreated on one of three diets that varied in protein and carbohydrate content (p35:c7, p21:c21 or p7:c35; % dry mass). After moulting to the sixth instar, they were transferred to one of three no-choice diets (p35:c7, p21:c21 or p7:c35) or a food choice where they received two nutritionally complementary diets (p35:c7 versus p7:c35). Approximately 80% of caterpillars that had been protein-deprived (p7: c35) during the fifth instar moulted to the seventh instar and developed into heavier pupae than those pupating after the sixth instar. The threshold body mass for pupal metamorphosis was 144 mg at the start of the sixth instar. Ingesting a diet low in protein or carbohydrate during the early instar led to a deficit in body protein or lipid content, respectively. When given a choice, caterpillars pretreated on the low-protein diet (p7:c35) selected significantly more protein and thus had a higher intake ratio of protein to carbohydrate than those from other diets (p35:c7, p21:c21). Our results suggest that caterpillars are not only capable of switching their developmental program to reduce the deleterious effects of an early deficiency of protein, but also flexible at adjusting nutrient preferences to redress specific nutritional imbalances experienced early in life.

AB An important step towards understanding conflicts in animal societies lies in identifying socioecological predictors of individual reproductive tactics. In gonochoristic species, individuals can choose to adopt breeding or nonbreeding tactics, and if they breed, how large a share of reproduction they acquire. In hermaphroditic species, individuals can also adopt male or female breeding tactics. Hermaphrodites' wider suite of reproductive options makes them interesting models for investigating predictors of reproductive tactics. We used molecular and ecological data to determine socioecological correlates of discrete (breeding versus nonbreeding; males versus female) and continuous (share of reproduction) reproductive tactics in the hermaphroditic coral-dwelling fish, Dascyllus aruanus. The number of potential competitors within groups was positively related to coral size, and the amount of total reproduction over which they competed was associated with the size of the largest individual (i.e. the parental male). Discrete and continuous reproductive tactics were strongly influenced by rank and body size: high-ranking and large individuals were more likely to breed and attain larger reproductive shares and output. High-ranking breeders also obtained a larger reproductive output if they adopted male tactics, whereas low-ranking breeders obtained a larger share if they adopted female tactics, which can explain why these fish show protogynous sex change. Genetic analysis also revealed that subordinates could attain a larger reproductive share than dominants, and that extragroup individuals could contribute to reproduction. Our results shed new light on the causes of variation in reproductive tactics, the payoffs from group membership and the nature conflict in hermaphroditic societies.

AB Courtship displays are important in governing mate choice, ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom and often spectacular in appearance. As such, they have received a long history of study that has greatly advanced our knowledge of intersexual selection. Yet despite this historical interest, critical gaps remain in our understanding of what aspects of courtship mates find attractive. In particular, the importance of signal repetition during courtship is beginning to become more apparent, but its functional significance in mate choice is still unclear. We outline how models of repeated displays, which have allowed us to make great strides in understanding agonistic contests, can also help us to understand mate choice. In fact, we contend that such models are essential for understanding the existence of repetitious courtship signals and the decision rules used by females when choosing among possible mates. Models of repeated displays offer an important, and currently unutilized, tool for the study of mate choice that we anticipate will provide new insights on intersexual selection. To facilitate this end, we present a practical guide of how researchers can implement a game theory approach in their studies of courtship displays and mate choice.

AB In mating systems with alternative reproductive tactics, female mimicry may allow some males to avoid aggression from larger territorial males and garner matings. However, selection is predicted to favour the territorial males' ability to discriminate against female mimics as they may usurp fertilizations in a male's territory and potentially eat eggs fertilized by the territory owner. I tested whether territorial males were able to recognize female-like sneaker males in the natural population of Comanche Springs pupfish, Cyprinodon elegans. Results of a field study conducted at Balmorhea State Park, Balmorhea, TX, U.S.A., revealed that territorial males behaviourally discriminate size and sex of conspecifics. They were more aggressive to large males than to sneaker males. However, territorial males also directed more aggressive behaviours towards sneaker males than similarly sized females. As sneaker males garner little aggression when a large male intruder is also present, they will potentially gain opportunities to spawn if large males commonly intrude into males' territories. These results suggest that aggression towards sneaker males is context dependent and that the social environment may have important evolutionary fitness consequences for both territorial males and sneaker males.

AB Since inbreeding can result in reduced offspring fitness, female animals often avoid mating with close relatives. In theory, males may also avoid inbreeding under certain conditions, notably if alternative mating opportunities are available at low cost. Hence competitively successful or dominant males may be more likely to avoid inbreeding because they have more mating opportunities. We tested these predictions in a promiscuous rodent with clear male dominance relationships, the bank vole, Myodes glareolus. Specifically, we quantified behavioural responses in relation to sibling and nonsibling females presented simultaneously under controlled experimental conditions. Male bank voles spent significantly less time in proximity to sibling than nonsibling females. However, contrary to theoretical predictions, male preference for nonsibling females did not differ significantly according to social status. Additionally, we found that male bank voles showed no preference for females as a function of either their body mass or age. Our findings suggest that regardless of their social status, male bank voles find nonsibling females more attractive than siblings. We discuss these results in relation to recent evidence of male status-dependent mate choice. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cooperative behaviour through reciprocation or interchange of valuable services in primates has received considerable attention, especially regarding the timeframe of reciprocation and its ensuing cognitive implications. Much less, however, is known about reciprocity in other animals, particularly birds. We investigated patterns of agonistic support (defined as a third party intervening in an ongoing conflict to attack one of the conflict participants, thus supporting the other) in a group of 13 captive ravens, Corvus corax. We found support for long-term, but not short-term, reciprocation of agonistic support. Ravens were more likely to support individuals who preened them, kin and dominant group members. These results suggest that ravens do not reciprocate on a calculated tit-for-tat basis, but aid individuals from whom reciprocated support would be most useful and those with whom they share a good relationship. Additionally, dyadic levels of agonistic support and consolation (postconflict affiliation from a bystander to the victim) correlated strongly with each other, but we found no evidence to suggest that receiving agonistic support influences the victim's likelihood of receiving support (consolation) after the conflict ends. Our findings are consistent with an emotionally mediated form of reciprocity in ravens and provide additional support for convergent cognitive evolution in birds and mammals.

AB The egg parasitoid Telenomus podisi Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) can eavesdrop on vibratory signals of adult stink bugs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the parasitoid can selectively respond to the sex-and species-specific songs of different stink bugs. Two-choice plant bioassays were performed using dried bean plants with two expanded opposite leaves that were vibrated with played-back signals or with naturally produced signals from live insects placed on plants. Each leaf was vibrated with signals of the host Euschistus heros Fabricius (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), the alternative host Piezodorus guildinii (Westwood) or the nonhost Chinavia impicticornis (Stal) (played back). Parasitoid females showed a selective response to the female songs of E. heros when these songs were tested against male songs or male-female duets. Telenomus podisi females also preferred E. heros female songs to female songs of the other pentatomid bugs tested. Our results show that T. podisi females respond selectively to female songs of their preferred host (E. heros); this behaviour may have relevant adaptive significance for the parasitoid, allowing it to forage in microhabitats with increased probability of finding host eggs. We discuss the ecological significance of the use of vibratory signals and interactions with other (chemical) cues during the host-searching behaviour of T. podisi.

   ASSESSMENT STRATEGY; ENERGY-METABOLISM
AB One of the most important decisions that an animal faces is whether to persist or surrender in an aggressive contest. It pays to win these encounters, but it might be just as economical to evaluate fighting costs and adjust behavioural decisions accordingly. Relatively few studies have explored the physiological basis of contest costs and fewer have determined the internal signals that animals might attend to during combat. We explored relationships between physiological parameters, including energy substrates, anaerobic metabolites and steroid hormones, and both contest performance and contest success in male convict cichlids, Amatitlania nigrofasciata. Size-matched pairs were allowed to fight until one member of the pair submitted, and tissues were subsequently harvested for analysis. There were no significant status differences (winner, loser, control) in mean postfight physiological measures. Dominance reinforcement during a short postsettlement period buffered the winners' stress response. In both winners and losers, muscle lactate concentrations correlated positively with contest intensity, while only losers showed a significant increase in plasma glucose concentrations as contests intensified. Larger cichlids used more costly fighting tactics than smaller conspecifics, and size asymmetries affected contest outcomes between larger animals significantly more than they did those between smaller animals. These findings suggest that fighting is metabolically costly and that the ramifications of these costs may differ in a size-dependent fashion. We use a recent literature on the scaling of anaerobic tolerance to evaluate the possibility that larger cichlids may be more tolerant of lactate accumulation, and thus able to both engage in more intense fighting tactics and persist longer in escalated fights than marginally smaller opponents. Contest intensity varied independently of mass asymmetries but varied positively with the absolute size of both the winner and loser, suggesting that convict cichlids use self-assessment strategies during contests with similarly sized opponents.

ID ANIMALS; RISK
AB All mammals thus far studied sleep, yet important questions remain concerning the ecological factors that influence sleep patterns. Here, we developed an evolutionary individual-based model to investigate the effect of predation pressure on prey sleep. We investigated three ecological conditions, including one that assumed a dynamic interaction between predator and prey behaviour. In condition 1, we found that monophasic predators (i.e. with one sleep bout per 24 h) select for monophasic prey that sleep perfectly out of phase with predators. In condition 2, predators were monophasic but the safety of prey varied as a function of their activity (sleeping versus awake). In this condition, the prey adjusted their sleeping behaviour to lower the risk of predation. Finally, in condition 3, we modelled a more dynamic interaction between predator and prey, with predator activity dependent on prey activity in the previous hour. In this scenario, the prey adjusted their behaviour relative to one another, resulting in either greater or lesser synchrony in prey as a function of predator searching behaviour. Collectively, our model demonstrates that predator behaviour can have a strong influence on prey sleep patterns, including whether prey are monophasic or polyphasic (i.e. with many sleep bouts per 24 h). The model further suggests that the timing of sleep relative to predator behaviour may depend strongly on how other potential prey partition the activity period.

AB Dispersal, and especially movement between the natal and the new environment, is a costly process. Costs are incurred not only during the preparation or transfer phase but also on arrival in a new environment. Such costs comprise, for instance, time costs because of the need to search for a suitable microhabitat or integration costs when immigration occurs in already densely populated habitat. The failure to settle or to integrate may consequently inflate the costs already incurred during emigration and transfer. Therefore, we expect emigrating individuals to have evolved enhanced integration capacities. In our laboratory experiments, dispersive phenotypes of the agrobiont spider Erigone atra were characterized by (1) faster settlement in empty habitat and (2) increased willingness to compete for ownership of already occupied sites. These correlated behaviours point to dispersive phenotypes (1) being likely to experience a selective advantage at settlement and (2) not being a random subsample from the population. These correlated behaviours are predicted to have a strong impact on spatial population dynamics and gene flow. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Social bonds between groupmates and social motivation can influence the stability of the social structure among domestic birds. Group size may also influence social stability, but no information is available about its influence on social bonding. We investigated the effect of group size and social motivation on the strength of social bonds between familiar Japanese quail chicks. The behaviour of quail selected for high (HSR) or low (LSR) social reinstatement behaviour and housed in different group sizes (6, 15 and 30 individuals) was recorded during two successive 10 min situations: separation and return of a cagemate or an unfamiliar conspecific. In both lines and for all group sizes, chicks formed social bonds with cagemates, shown by disturbance at separation and a greater calming effect of the return of a familiar versus an unfamiliar quail. LSR chicks might form stronger social bonds than HSR ones but our results do not allow us to conclude confidently on that point. With increasing group size, the calming effect and especially the positive social interactions decreased in both lines, indicating a weakening of the social bond between familiar conspecifics, perhaps because of the larger number of potential partners or the establishment of a tolerant social strategy based on less aggression, less time spent in contact and weaker bonds. Further investigations of the relationship between group size and social bonding in this species may allow us to determine why their social behaviour changes with increasing group size and to make more suitable social environments for domestic birds.

AB Animals form memory types that differ in duration and stability. The initial anaesthesia-sensitive memory (ASM) can be replaced by anaesthesia-resistant memory (ARM), and/or by protein synthesis-dependent, long-term memory (LTM). We previously showed that two closely related parasitic wasp species differ in learning rate and memory consolidation. In Cotesia glomerata, LTM lasting at least 24 h was formed after single-trial conditioning, whereas single-trial conditioning led to ARM that waned before 24 h in Cotesia rubecula. This species formed LTM only after repeated conditioning trials spaced in time. Here, we used artificial selection on learning rate to investigate whether selection for a low learning rate in C. glomerata would result in C. rubecula-like memory dynamics. Memory consolidation was tested by using cold-shock anaesthesia and protein synthesis inhibitors. After single-trial conditioning, ARM was consolidated within hours in unselected C. rubecula, but directly, without an intermediate ARM phase, into LTM in unselected C. glomerata. We obtained low learning rate selection lines of C. glomerata wasps that, like C. rubecula, did not form LTM after single-trial conditioning, to see whether such wasps would then consolidate ARM instead of LTM. We showed that this was not the case. The selected wasps formed LTM after repeated, spaced conditioning trials, but formed only ASM without consolidation of ARM or LTM after single-trial learning. Ecological consequences of this type of memory formation are discussed. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sexual selection often involves female preference for males of a certain age, and a body of theory predicts preference for old males. We measured a comprehensive set of traits from the acoustic sexual display of male field crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, and found that nearly all song traits changed predictably as males aged, involving a general slowing down of the wing movements during song production. Our female preference experiments indicated a strong and repeatable preference for the songs of young males, contradicting the existing literature, which argues that female crickets prefer older males on the basis of changes in song carrier frequency. Rather, female preference for young male song was determined by its high energetic quality. We develop the 'old flight muscle' hypothesis, arguing that age-related degradation of stridulatory muscle performance is likely to result in the observed changes with age. Secondary sexual characters may be subject to oxidative somatic degradation suggesting that, when males provide only sperm, females should prefer the sexual displays of young males. Our results support new modelling approaches and a growing body of empirical evidence suggesting that old males are not always preferred by females.

AB Potential foraging and social traditions have been identified in groups of wild capuchin monkeys (Cebus spp.). Verification of traditions requires documentation that socially mediated learning contributes to acquisition by new practitioners. We investigated the emergence and maintenance of a foraging tradition in two generations of infant tufted capuchins (Cebus apella) in captive social groups. In baseline, we provided the first cohort of infants with a foraging apparatus that dispensed juice via two methods inside a small enclosure away from adult interference (the creche). Later in phase 1, we provided a second apparatus to all group members with only one method of solution available (in the group setting); the creche apparatus, with both methods available, remained accessible to infants only. Two years later (phase 2), we replicated phase 1 with a new cohort of infants from the same social groups. As adult activity and expertise with the apparatus increased across baseline (no adult activity), phase 1 (initially unskilled) and phase 2 (initially skilled), the proportion of infants in each cohort that acquired the foraging skill increased and their latency to skill acquisition decreased. Despite ambiguous evidence that the infants conformed to the specific method of solution common in their group, the social context clearly contributed to the development and maintenance of a general foraging tradition. The results provide support for the existence of traditions in wild capuchin groups. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Self-referential phenotype matching, or using one's own cues as a referent for recognizing kin, is expected in species with multiple paternity or maternity to discriminate among full siblings and half-siblings, or in nepotistic contexts to accurately assess relatedness. It would also facilitate optimal inbreeding and outbreeding. Self-matching has been predicted for Belding's ground squirrels, Urocitellus beldingi, yet previous work could not rule out the possibility that animals use family cues rather than or in addition to their own cues for recognition. After hibernation, U. beldingi recognize their littermates but not previously familiar nonkin. Kin templates, including cues of mother and littermates, may be maintained throughout life, or, they may be lost during hibernation with memories of unrelated individuals, in which case self-matching must be used to create a new template in the spring. Using a cross-fostering design, these two possibilities were tested with olfactory discrimination tests after ground squirrels aroused from hibernation. Yearlings recognized their siblings, but not fostermates they had been reared with since birth, demonstrating that kin templates are lost over winter and self-matching is used to recognize kin after hibernation. Results are discussed in terms of plasticity of kin recognition systems, the costs and benefits of maintaining social memories, and the contexts in which templates are updated.

AB Dietary mixing of different food items enhances the performance of many animals; however, few studies have tested the mechanisms influencing mixing within individual plants by herbivores. We investigated the mechanisms promoting apparent foliage-age dietary mixing by a specialist sawfly, Pikonema alaskensis (Roh.) (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae), within juvenile black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.). Field defoliation surveys indicated that larvae generally prefer developing foliage, and most defoliation occurs in the upper crown of trees. However, when upper-crown developing foliage becomes scarce, many larvae consume mature foliage in the upper crown rather than dispersing to lower branches, where preferred developing foliage remains abundant. Manipulative field experiments were conducted to compare the performance of early and late-instar larvae fed mixed versus individual age classes (i.e. developing or mature) of foliage in the upper and lower crown. In contrast to all past studies, foliage-age mixing by P. alaskensis was not associated with nutrient balancing or toxin dilution. Instead, mixing was associated with an expansion of feeding breadth in larvae as they developed, coupled with high levels of variation in resource quality between upper and lower crown levels, which enabled older larvae consuming mature foliage in the upper crown to achieve similar survival as those consuming developing foliage in the lower crown. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity in studies of foliage-age preference-performance relationships for herbivores within trees and demonstrates how a herbivore can use dietary mixing to dramatically expand its resources while simultaneously accounting for heterogeneity within large, architecturally complex plants.

AB A widespread pattern across polygynous ungulate species, and many other vertebrate taxa, is for animals of the same species to live in spatially segregated single-sex groups outside the mating season. This type of social organization is known as sexual segregation. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain sexual segregation but there is still no agreement as to the main cause. Since this behaviour is common in polygynous ungulate species, we hypothesized that sexual segregation evolved in response to the development of male competitive mating skills. To formalize this hypothesis, we developed an individual-based evolutionary model. In this model individuals interact to gain resources and social fighting skills, which ultimately determine their reproductive success. Individuals influence their social interactions by preferring to interact with a particular 'body size class' of individuals. This preference is a heritable trait. Robust social preferences evolve which produce significant levels of sexual segregation over a wide range of parameters. Segregation is particularly strong when the marginal fitness of fighting skills exceeds a certain threshold. The results are qualitatively consistent with independent comparative studies, although formal validation will require carefully designed experiments. This suggests a linkage between the evolution of sexual segregation and sexual dimorphism in ungulates. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an evolutionary model has shown that sexual selection of fighting skills can drive sexual segregation in polygynous ungulates. 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To enhance the fitness benefits of social and sexual interaction, animals should be able to decipher information about the genetic makeup of conspecifics. The use of relative criteria to estimate genetic relatedness could facilitate nepotism or inbreeding avoidance, and the use of absolute criteria to estimate genetic quality could help identify the fittest competitor or the best mate. For animals to process trade-offs between relatedness and quality, however, both relative and absolute genetic information must be concurrently available and detectable by conspecifics. Although there is increasing evidence to suggest that animals make genetically informed decisions about their partners, and may even process trade-offs, we understand relatively little about the sensory mechanisms informing these decisions. In previous analyses of the olfactory signals of ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, we showed that both scrotal and labial secretions seasonally encode chemical information about (1) pairwise genetic relatedness, within and between the sexes, and (2) individual heterozygosity. Here, using a signaller-receiver paradigm, we conducted behavioural bioassays to test whether male and female lemurs are sensitive to these olfactory sources of genetic information in unfamiliar conspecifics. As the lemurs discriminated conspecific glandular secretions by pairwise relatedness and individual heterozygosity, volatile olfactory signals can be used by both sexes to concurrently process relative and absolute genetic information about conspecifics. Beyond supporting an olfactory mechanism of kin discrimination and mate choice in a primate, we suggest that animals could use olfactory processing to trade off between selection for the most compatible partner versus the most genetically diverse partner.

AB Newborn infants can affect female social dynamics, and provide ideal conditions to test the biological market theory and its assumptions. In infant markets, infants are the desired commodity, mothers control access to them, and other females (potential handlers) trade grooming for infant handling. The supply/demand ratio corresponds to the number of available infants per potential handler. Variation in the number of infants causes changes in the supply/demand ratio that can alter the market equilibrium. We investigated whether grooming was interchanged for handling in wild tufted capuchin females, Cebus apella nigritus. Behavioural observations were conducted on 10 mothers in three groups. Potential handlers were strongly attracted to infants and grooming the mothers (specifically, its occurrence rather than its duration) increased their probability of handling infants. However, the number of infants in the group did not affect the amount of grooming needed for access to infants. At least three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses can explain differences from previous findings. First, grooming in capuchin monkeys may represent a signal of benign intent with no market value. Second, dominance relations among handlers may have prevented competition by outbidding among handlers and thus hindered free trade. Third, the increased grooming required by mothers when infants were scarcer may reflect the need to calm more stressed mothers that were the subject of more frequent harassment; since in our study mothers did not appear to be more stressed when fewer infants were available, no effect of the number of infants on grooming by handlers emerged.

AB Polyandry brings about benefits for females but, from the males' perspective, if there is a possibility of females mating with multiple partners, male characteristics that prevent or delay remating of females are favoured, which may result in antagonistic coevolution between the sexes. The green-veined white butterfly, Pieris napi, is a predominantly polyandrous species with male nutrient donation transferred within the ejaculate at mating. Male ejaculates that are exaggerated in size or content can be interpreted as a means to reduce female remating. We explored whether geographical variation in the degree of polyandry among P. napi populations results from variation in the male's ability to manipulate females to mate at a suboptimal rate. Females that mated with a larger male capable of delivering a large spermatophore remated later than those that mated with a smaller male. However, we found no spatial variation in sexual size dimorphism or relative ejaculate size. Moreover, the mating frequency of females was not affected by the origin of males with which they mated. We argue that even if large male ejaculates evolved to ensure paternity of a given male with negative side-effects on female fitness, female counteradaptations conceal possible implications of antagonistic coevolution. Geographical variation in female mating frequency is probably maintained by selection acting upon female life history traits associated with the degree of polyandry.

AB In teleost fishes, the lateral system is assumed to contribute, among other roles, to maintaining schooling behaviour. Sight is also assumed to play a role in schooling, as fish with a cut lateral line do not stop schooling unless they are also blinded. This conclusion, however, is based on experiments where only the trunk lateral line was inactivated, leaving the head lateral system intact. We investigated how inactivation of the whole lateral system affects fish shoaling behaviour. Groups of firehead tetras, Hemigrammus bleheri, were videorecorded before and after inactivation of their whole lateral system with aminoglycoside antibiotics (and also in sham-treated specimens). Shoaling behaviour was characterized by nearest distance to the first, second and third neighbours, shoal radius, shoal order parameter and the number of collisions between individuals. Scanning electron microscope observations showed damage to most superficial neuromasts as a result of antibiotic treatment. Importantly, the antibiotic-treated fish proved unable to maintain a shoal. After the end of the treatment, however, they recovered both a normal tissue morphology and normal shoaling behaviour within about a month. The lateral system is thus more crucial to shoaling behaviour than previously believed. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
DE fiddler crab; sexual dimorphism; territoriality; territory defence; Uca
   annulipes
AB In many territorial species males invest substantially in weapons, which they use in fights to acquire and maintain territories that ultimately give them access to females. Females often live within male territories or in female-only areas that are segregated from males. Under these circumstances, females do not have to compete directly with males for space, and in the context of territory acquisition and defence there is therefore no cost to being weaponless. In fiddler crabs, however, weaponless females hold territories among well-armed males. How do they do this? Observations and replacement experiments were carried out on Uca annulipes to determine how males and females acquire and defend territories. Weaponless females were as capable as well-armed males of both acquiring and defending a burrow. Females acquired burrows by seeking out empty ones, while males acquired them by evicting male and female burrow owners. After acquiring a burrow, males mainly fought with male neighbours and females with female neighbours. Both sexes were equally likely to be evicted from their burrow and the likelihood that they remained on their territory for 24 h or more was the same. Males and females thus used different strategies of burrow acquisition and defence, and the male strategy appeared to be more costly. We discuss possible explanations for these differences.

AB It is generally assumed that age is potentially an important aspect affecting the mating biology of insects. Some theoretical models correlate mating success with male age, and predict female preference for either older males, as they have proven viability, or younger partners, to avoid age-related fitness costs. Differences in mating success of males in relation to age have been observed in Lepidoptera. We investigated the mating success of males in relation to their age, controlling for mating experience, and the fitness of their female mates in the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis. In a laboratory experiment we examined mating success in relation to age and the consequences of male age for female fitness parameters. Male age had no significant influence on mating success for O. nubilalis males: 0-day-old virgin males were as likely to mate as 3-, 6- and 9-day-old males. Testes size decreased and spermatophore size increased with virgin male age. Lifetime fecundity was highest for females that mated with 3-day-old virgin males, which was related to their greater longevity. There was no trade-off between daily fecundity and longevity for females mating with different-aged males. These results suggest that direct benefits from males are insufficient to account for the observed female mating preferences for different-aged males.

AB Polyandry is common in many animal species. The hypotheses proposed to explain the evolution of polyandry generally fall into two categories: to gain material benefits and to obtain genetic benefits. Here we report our findings on a polyandrous moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). The present study does not support the hypothesis that females gain material benefits from multiple copulations in terms of sperm replenishment, fecundity and longevity, because females that copulated once and females that copulated more than once with the same or different males had similar fertility, fecundity and longevity. Females used three strategies to gain possible genetic benefits: discriminating against previous mates probably via chemical cues, giving 60% chance of paternity to second males, and adjusting their oviposition patterns depending on whether they encountered new or previous mates after the first copulation. For the third strategy, females that encountered new mates after the first copulation saved eggs until the next day to facilitate fertilization of their eggs with the sperm of their new mates. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that polyandry increases offspring viability, because polyandry did not affect egg hatching success, offspring survival or weight. Ephestia kuehniella showed limited ability to disperse, and females laid all their eggs locally, mostly within 2 days, suggesting that offspring live together and that sib copulations are common in this species. Therefore, polyandry is probably a mechanism for reducing sib competition and inbreeding costs in offspring. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although the benefits of maternal care have been investigated in many species, the caring role of males in species with exclusive paternal care has received less attention. We experimentally quantified the protective role of paternal care in the harvestman Iporangaia pustulosa. Additionally, we compared the effectiveness of paternal care against predation in this species with a syntopic harvestman with maternal care, Acutisoma proximum. We demonstrated that nearly one-third of the unprotected Iporangaia clutches disappeared entirely in 12 days, while the other two-thirds suffered a mean reduction of 55% in egg number. Conversely, 50% of the control clutches did not suffer any reduction, and only one was entirely consumed by predators. We also demonstrated that the mucus coat that covers Iporangaia clutches has an important deterrent role against predation by conspecifics: 58.3% of the clutches without mucus were attacked and three of them were entirely consumed, whereas only three clutches with mucus were attacked, suffering a reduction of up to three eggs. Iporangaia males were as efficient as Acutisoma females in protecting eggs. However, unattended Acutisoma eggs were attacked 20% more frequently than unattended Iporangaia eggs. Unattended Iporangaia eggs are protected by a mucus coat that prevents or decreases predation rate, whereas Acutisoma eggs are more susceptible to predation, probably because they lack this mucus coat. Thus, besides the fact that Iporangaia males efficiently protect the offspring against egg predators, females also contribute to egg protection by providing a mucus coat that deters egg predators.

AB The organized flight of birds is one of the most easily observed, yet challenging to study, phenomena in biology. Birds that fly in organized groups generally do so in one of two fashions: Line formations and Cluster formations. The former groups are typical of large birds such as waterfowl, where birds fly arranged in single lines, often joined together. The scientific questions about these groups usually involve potential adaptive functions, such as why geese fly in a V. Cluster formations are typically made up of large numbers of smaller birds such as pigeons or starlings flying in more irregular arrangements that have a strong three-dimensional character. The groups are defined by synchronized and apparently simultaneous rapid changes in direction. Scientific questions about these groups are usually concerned with mechanism such as how synchrony is achieved. Although field observations about the phenomenon date to the origins of natural history, experimental studies did not begin until the 1970s. Early experimenters and theoreticians were primarily biologists, but more recently aeronautical engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists and, currently, physicists have been attracted to the study of organized flight. Computer modelling has recently generated striking visual representations of organized flight and a number of hypotheses about its functions and mechanisms, but the ability to test these hypotheses lags behind the capacity to generate them. We suggest that a multi disciplinary approach to the phenomenon will be necessary to resolve apparently conflicting current hypotheses. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social learning occurs through the observation of conspecifics performing biologically relevant behaviours. Like other forms of learning, aptitude for such tasks may be influenced by cerebral lateralization. Social recognition is subject to lateralization and it seems highly likely that any lateralization effect would be transposed onto a social-learning situation. We used a social version of a passive avoidance task in which one chick (the demonstrator) pecked at a red bead while another chick (the observer) viewed the demonstrator's response. This bead was either coated in the bitter-tasting substance methylanthranilate (MeA) or was left dry. Thirty minutes later both chicks were presented with a similar, dry, bead to determine whether learning had taken place. Experiment 1 showed that chicks were able to learn, by observation only, not to peck the bead when it had been coated in MeA at training. Experiment 2 demonstrated a role of lateralization in performing the task; specifically, male observer chicks trained binocularly but tested monocularly had a poorer performance in this task with the left hemisphere than with the right. In experiment 3, we both trained and tested chicks monocularly. This time there was no difference between left-eyed and right-eyed chicks, suggesting a spontaneous bias for encoding relevant information available at training in the right hemisphere. In conclusion, chicks are able to avoid pecking just by observing a conspecific. The social learning appears to be lateralized to the right hemisphere in male chicks, females showing no bias in lateralization. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Several studies have suggested that primates vary in their response to spatial reduction, which represents a challenge for captive animals. Under spatial reduction, primates can adopt various strategies to reduce social tension. Such strategies, which are not mutually exclusive, can involve avoidance and coping tactics. Recently, it has been shown that, during short-term crowding, bonobos may use both grooming and nonreproductive sexuality to avoid a potential rise in tension. Because bonobos are extremely playful, and play can be a risky activity, we tested whether play patterns were selectively avoided under space reduction. We collected daily data via focal animal sampling on a group of bonobos housed in the Apenheul Primate Park (Apeldoorn, The Netherlands) over a 12-month period. Among the adults, we found no difference in the contact play levels play fighting between the two space conditions (outdoors, 5000 m(2), and indoors, 230 m(2)), whereas indoors, there was a tendency toward an increase in locomotor-rotational play frequency. These findings indicate that bonobos do not adopt an avoidance tactic to reduce the risk involved in space reduction. Nevertheless, dyads showing higher rates of agonistic encounters were less likely to engage in contact play sessions. Even though it is difficult to affirm that space availability significantly induced higher playmate selectivity, we found that play signals significantly increased indoors, thus suggesting the need for a clearer 'declaration of intentions' in an unsafe situation.

AB Male dominance hierarchies are usually linked to relative body size and to weapon size, that is, to determinants of fighting ability. Secondary sexual characters that are not directly used as weapons could still be linked to dominance if they reveal determination or overall health and vigour and hence, indirectly, fighting ability. We studied the mating behaviour of the minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus, a cyprinid fish in which males develop breeding tubercles during the spawning season. The function of these breeding tubercles is still not clear. Using microsatellite markers, we determined male reproductive success under controlled conditions. The minnows were territorial and quickly established a dominance hierarchy at the beginning of the spawning season. Dominance was strongly and positively linked to fertilization success. Although body size and number of breeding tubercles were not significantly correlated in our sample, both large males and males with many breeding tubercles were more dominant and achieved higher fertilization success than small males or males with few tubercles. We found multimale fertilization in most clutches, suggesting that sperm competition is important in this species. Females showed behaviour that may be linked to spawning decision, that is, male dominance might not be the only determinant of male reproductive success in minnows.

AB Among the various properties of visual warning signals, colour seems to be especially important for avian predators. We tested the role of particular colours of an aposematic insect (firebug, Pyrrhocoris apterus; Heteroptera: Pyrrhocoridae) in unlearned avoidance, learning, memory and generalization of a naive avian predator (great tit, Parus major). The wild type of the firebug is aposematic, red-and-black, and its colour mutants (white, yellow, orange) retain the same black pattern; the bug can be made artificially nonaposematic (painted uniformly brown). Wild-caught great tits avoid the firebug depending on colour, and their reaction to variously coloured prey is a result of avoidance learning and may vary according to their experience. We trained naive great tits to avoid firebugs of different colours, and then gave some birds a memory test with firebugs of the same colour and other birds a generalization test with firebugs of a different colour. Naive, hand-reared great tits showed no initial avoidance and attacked firebugs irrespective of colour. They learned to avoid all the colour forms at a similar rate. The generalization was asymmetric: birds that learned to avoid red firebugs did not generalize their experience to yellow or white mutants whereas birds that learned to avoid yellow mutants generalized their experience to red firebugs. The red colour thus represents a more effective signal than the yellow; predation by birds could have played a crucial role in selectively favoured evolutionary transitions from yellow to red coloration in pyrrhocorids.

AB Can females enhance their fitness by choosing a mate based on his disease resistance in addition to his current health and robustness (i. e. male condition)? The complex nature of disease resistance may constrain the evolution of female choice for this trait. Using a mathematical model, we found that choice for immune function (an element of disease resistance) provided females with a fitness advantage. However, the fitness advantage was often small, much smaller than the fitness advantage that females obtained from mating with males in good condition. Females choosing for a combination of male condition and male immune function sometimes showed no fitness advantage compared with females choosing for condition alone, even when condition and immune function were positively correlated. Our results suggest that when condition and immune function are correlated, selection for choice for male immune function may be driven by the fitness advantage that comes from mating with males in the best condition, even if a sexually selected trait correlates with male immune function. Moreover, females choosing for males with maximal immune function produced offspring with immune functions above the level needed for maximal fitness. In some species, females may gain little or no fitness advantage by choosing for male immune function per se in addition to male condition, which may explain why not all studies find evidence for female choice for male immunocompetence.

AB Female vertebrates frequently ingest undeveloped ova and stillborn offspring. Two hypotheses have been proposed to interpret this behaviour: ( 1) it is a form of parental care, and ( 2) it recycles otherwise wasted energy, facilitating maternal recovery. Our study of Mexican lance-headed rattlesnakes provides the first quantitative description of cannibalism by postparturient rattlesnakes. We collected gravid females during June-July of 2004-2007 in central Mexico, recording 239 litters from 190 females. Production of nonviable offspring was common ( 48% of litters). Most females ( 68%) ate some or all nonviable offspring, consuming an average of 11% of postpartum mass. Females consumed undeveloped ova and stillborn neonates in similar proportions. To evaluate factors that influenced the decision to cannibalize we used logistic regression. The best model included four predictive variables: ( 1) parturition date; ( 2) proportion of nonviable offspring mass per litter; ( 3) maternal investment index; and ( 4) snout-vent length ( SVL). All variables exerted a positive effect on maternal cannibalism, although SVL was only a marginally significant predictor. Consumption of nonviable offspring confers energetic benefits to emaciated postparturient females. Energetic benefits are greatest when a large proportion of a litter is nonviable, while the pressure to cannibalize is greatest when late parturition shortens the time available to forage before the next reproductive event. Our results demonstrate the importance of maternal cannibalism in rattlesnakes, and suggest stronger support for the maternal recovery hypothesis than for the parental care hypothesis.

AB In Gammarus pulex, male-male competition is generally intense because the operational sex ratio (OSR) is strongly biased towards males; however, studies have shown possible fluctuation in this intrasexual competition, which could be caused by sperm depletion, a phenomenon recently found in gammarids. Sperm depletion may also affect male mating behaviour. We therefore tested the influence of sperm depletion on the OSR in G. pulex. Two sets of experiments were conducted: first, to find out the number of sperm in the testis before and after mating events (sperm depletion), and second, to test the implications of sperm depletion for the mating behaviour of male G. pulex. We found substantial sperm allocation to each reproductive event but also a relatively fast replenishment. However, contrary to one of our hypotheses, sperm depletion had no impact on the male reproductive 'time-out' and therefore on the OSR, since depleted males could engage in a precopula within a few hours of a previous copulation. The decision to initiate an amplexus de novo was more dependent on indicators of the female's quality such as her time left to moult. Depletion status also did not affect male competitive ability. Indeed, in a competitive context, recently mated G. pulex males were more likely to pair again than those males that had not mated recently, independently of sperm reserves, male size and energy storage. Consequently, some males had better access to reproduction than others, which could be explained by various hypotheses. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Task assignment and division of labour in social groups persist as a key issue in the evolution of behaviour. Previous studies have argued that honeybees, Apis mellifera, display a pollen foraging syndrome that plays an important role in structuring the temporal division of labour within their colonies. Bees with low-sucrose-response thresholds early in life forage earlier and are more likely to be pollen-biased foragers than those that have higher thresholds early in life. We tested the hypothesis that sucrose-response thresholds are consistently expressed by bees performing a cluster of tasks-guarding, fanning and undertaking-that are typical of middle-aged bees. These three task groups show mean response thresholds that do not differ significantly from those of pollen foragers collected from the same colonies. However, a substantial percentage of undertakers do not respond in the bioassay, a feature that this group shares with nectar foragers. Notably, whereas mean colony response threshold varies among colonies, the ordination of response thresholds among tasks varies little among colonies. Sucrose-response thresholds for pollen and nectar foragers in our study were consistent with published results for these task groups. Our results support the hypothesis that task and sucrose-response thresholds are entwined and suggest the further hypothesis that fanning and guarding are associated with pollen collection.

AB Whether threat displays can reveal information about the strength or condition of the contestants is a long-debated issue. Enquist (1985, Animal Behaviour, 33, 1152-1161) showed that communication of such information is possible by means of choice of action in aggressive encounters. The key assumption of Enquist's model is that weak individuals signalling that they are strong (i.e. cheaters) cannot get away without fighting even if they want to, if they meet an honest strong individual. However, this assumption was not elaborated further and Enquist's model is often cited in support of Zahavi's handicap principle. Here I elaborate this assumption and show in terms of Enquist's model, by introducing spatial distance between opponents as a continuous variable, that it is the proximity of the opponent, what I call 'proximity risk', that maintains the honesty of threat displays. I show that the honest use of threat displays, sensu Enquist, is evolutionarily stable only within a certain distance threshold. Outside this threshold there may or may not be a zone where a mixture of honest and cheating displays can be evolutionarily stable. Outside this second zone threat displays are unreliable and thus expected not to be used and attended to. The model gives specific predictions about weaponry, species-specific fighting techniques and the value of these thresholds. Finally, I show that key predictions of the model, namely the relation between signal intensity, riskiness and proximity has strong support in the literature.

AB Male songbirds typically mate-guard by closely following the female during her fertile period. At dawn, males may sing near the nest or roost to direct their chorus at mates. Recent evidence suggests males may also be involved in singing interactions with neighbours during the dawn chorus. We used a 16-channel acoustic location system to examine the movement behaviour of 37 male black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, during the dawn chorus to determine if male proximity to the nest is a function of breeding stage. Males with fertile females covered a significantly smaller area within their territory, made fewer long-distance movements and sang at a lower song rate compared to males with nonfertile females. Males with fertile mates remained significantly closer to their nest cavity than males with incubating mates. Males with nonfertile mates spent more time near their neighbours with fertile mates than near their neighbours with nonfertile mates. Neither social rank nor age had a significant effect on movement behaviour or song rate. Our results clearly show that female fertility influences dawn chorusing behaviour in male black-capped chickadees. Males may remain near their nest to minimize the risk of cuckoldry, but when their partner is not fertile males may increase movement behaviour to interact with neighbours and/or to advertise to potential extrapair mates.

AB Migratory birds deposit fat and protein before passing ecological barriers and must economize these during such crossings. Birds crossing the western Sahara during autumn face a trade-off between cold and humid air along with head winds at high altitudes versus warm and dry air along with tail winds at low altitudes. Since water loss rate increases with temperature, migrants should avoid warm and dry air to save water and hence fly at high altitudes. By quantifying nocturnal songbird migration across the western Sahara with radar, we found that more than 60% of the songbirds migrated below 1000 m above ground level. Thus, the majority of songbirds performed sustained migratory flights in much warmer and drier conditions than predicted ( weighted means: 30 degrees C; relative humidity: 27%; water vapour density: 7.8 g/m(3)). Based on the metabolically available water from fat and protein catabolism, we estimated the maximum possible overall water loss rate of a flying model bird, the garden warbler, Sylvia borin, for the entire Sahara crossing at 0.29 g/h. This is considerably lower than water loss rates for the same model bird passing our study site, 0.62 g/h at 30 degrees C, based on applied calculations of physiological studies. Our results clearly show that migrating songbirds can fly at much higher temperatures, and have considerably lower water loss rates, than predicted. This new insight based on observations under natural conditions will have substantial impact on the development of new physiological models for birds and other animals with restricted access to water.

AB Male-male competition for mating territories can exert negative frequency- dependent selection on a male secondary sexual trait, such as nuptial coloration. This can occur when males bias aggression towards owncoloured competitors, resulting in a fitness advantage for rare phenotypes, thereby promoting the evolution and maintenance of stable colour polymorphisms. It could operate in the extensive radiations of haplochromine cichlid fish in East African lakes. In a previous investigation we studied wild- caught blue and red Pundamilia males from Lake Victoria; males from a location where most resemble blue (referred to as bluish males) biased aggression towards blue stimulus males. In contrast, blue males from a location where blue and red occur sympatrically biased aggression towards red stimulus males. Using lab- bred bluish and blue males, we tested the hypothesis that exclusive experience with blue males (blue treatment) leads to an aggression bias towards blue and that experience with blue and red males (mixed treatment) leads to an aggression bias towards red. Contrary to predictions, blue- treated males did not distinguish between blue and red males, whereas mixed- treated males preferentially attacked blue stimulus males. The data suggest that prior experience can affect aggression biases and that experience with more than one phenotype may be required for the development of biases. Yet, our results cannot explain the direction of differences in specific biases observed in wild- caught males from different populations. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal groups are often nonrandom assemblages of individuals that tend to be assorted by factors such as sex, body size, relatedness and familiarity. Laboratory studies using fish have shown that familiarity among shoal members confers a number of benefits to individuals, such as increased foraging success. However, it is unclear whether fish in natural shoals obtain these benefits through association with familiars. We investigated whether naturally occurring shoals of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, are more adept at learning a novel foraging task than artificial ( in which we selected shoal members randomly) shoals. We used social network analysis to compare the structures of natural and artificial shoals and examined whether shoal organization predicts patterns of foraging behaviour. Fish in natural shoals benefited from increased success in the novel foraging task compared with fish in artificial shoals. Individuals in natural shoals showed a reduced latency to approach the novel feeder, followed more and formed smaller subgroups compared to artificial shoals. Our findings show that fish in natural shoals do gain foraging benefits and that this may be facilitated by a reduced perception of risk among familiarized individuals and/or enhanced social learning mediated by following other individuals and small group sizes. Although the structure of shoals was stable over time, we found no direct relationship between shoal social structure and patterns of foraging behaviour.

AB Cultural evolution is an important force in creating and maintaining behavioural variation in some species. Vocal dialects have provided a useful model for the study of cultural evolution and its interactions with genetic evolution. This study examined the acoustic and geographical changes in vocal dialects over an 11-year span in the yellow-naped amazon, Amazona auropalliata, in Costa Rica. Contact calls were recorded at 16 communal night roosts in 1994 and 19 roosts in 2005, with 12 of the roosts sampled in both surveys. In both surveys, three dialects were found, each characterized by a distinctive contact call type and each encompassing multiple roosts. The limits between two of these dialects, the North and South dialects, was found to be geographically stable, while at the boundary between the North and Nicaraguan dialect there was introgression of each call type into roosts in the bordering dialect. Acoustic measurements and cross-correlations of spectrograms detected no change in the acoustic structure of contact calls in the South dialect but did show significant differences in the calls of both the North and Nicaraguan dialect between 1994 and 2005. These results are consistent with the vocal convergence hypothesis, which proposes that dialects are long-term features maintained through some combination of biased transmission of local call types and purifying selection against foreign call types. Migration, copying errors and cultural drift may also play a role in the more subtle changes seen in the acoustic form of dialect call types.

AB Most studies of female mating preferences have found preferences for males with greater trait expression. This has led to the suggestion that most female preferences are in the direction of greater sensory stimulation and may be the result of pre-existing sensory biases. Recently, studies have revealed that mating preferences can be lost or reversed, even in species where a pre-existing sensory bias appears to be the basis of female preferences. These studies concentrate on changes in female preferences on evolutionary timescales, and there is little evidence of whether female mating preferences based on pre-existing sensory biases can be altered by individual experience. Using green swordtail fish, we investigated whether female preferences for less ornamented males can be induced by manipulating early social experience. Throughout their early life females were exposed to either all long-sworded males, all short-sworded males or alternating long-and short-sworded males. Restricting experience in this way resulted in only females with experience restricted to short-sworded males developing any consistent preference, and this was for short-sworded males. This is the first evidence that female preferences based on pre-existing sensory biases can be altered ontogenetically and indicates such preferences can be remarkably labile.

AB Cleaning fish mutualisms appear to be good examples of biological markets. Two classes of traders exist: cleaner fish and their fish clients, each of which supplies a commodity required by the other (ectoparasite removal and a meal, respectively). However, clients are not all treated similarly by cleaners. There is evidence that clients with choice options (with potential access to more than one cleaner) have priority of access over clients without choice options. Market theory predicts that client value (i.e. ectoparasite load) should also influence cleaning service quality. We examined the relative roles of client choice options and client value in determining the duration of cleaning interactions between bluestreak cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, and their clients across three geographically distant sites. We found a lack of covariation between client choice options and gnathiid ectoparasite loads. Geographical differences in gnathiid availability altered the importance of client gnathiid load as a determinant of client inspection duration. As predicted, clients with both choice options and high gnathiid loads were inspected for longer, but this was observed only in an area with a relatively high incidence of parasitism. These correlational results suggest that the importance of client choice for aspects of cleaner fish service quality may be modulated by parasite availability.

AB While much research has focused on the evolution of conspicuous male displays, ornaments and behaviours, less is understood about the evolution of similar traits in females. To determine whether females express these traits as nonadaptive by-products of sexual selection favouring the same traits in males or whether females are directly selected to express such traits, the benefits of these traits must be understood. The prevalence of aggression in female-female competition suggests that females may experience direct sexual selection for aggressiveness, but data are lacking. I used the tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor, to test the hypothesis that selection directly favours aggressiveness in females during intrasexual competition over nesting sites. After assaying the aggressiveness of a population of tree swallows, I experimentally reduced the number of nesting cavities, a resource required for female reproductive success. More aggressive females were more likely to obtain nesting cavities after the experimental reduction, while female age and male aggressiveness did not predict nesting cavity acquisition. Aggressive behaviour in female tree swallows is therefore beneficial in the context of female-female competition for a critical breeding resource. These results indicate that the processes favouring aggressiveness in intrasexual competition among females may not be very different from the processes shaping aggressive behaviour in males.

AB Male Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, sing a single, individually distinctive song their entire life, which they presumably learn from other males in the same population. We took advantage of a strongly philopatric, known-age and known-parentage island population to examine the influence of five tutor types on song learning: a bird's social father, genetic father, natal neighbours, older breeding-year neighbours and 1-year-old breeding-year neighbours. Of 57 males banded as nestlings, there was wide variation in the tutor type with the greatest influence on song learning. Based on pairwise visual comparisons of spectrograms of all co-occurring males plus quantitative measures of similarity of digitized songs, only 12% of males sang songs that were most strongly influenced by their social father, as inferred by overall similarity of entire songs. About 45% of males were the product of extrapair paternity, but no male sang a song that was most similar to his genetic (versus social) father. Thirty-five per cent of males produced songs that were most similar to those of natal neighbours, 26% sang songs most like older breeding-year neighbours and 26% sang songs most like 1-year-old breeding-year neighbours. Neither a male's body condition at. edging nor his. edging date was related to tutor type, and tutors did not differ from nontutors in morphology, longevity or reproductive success. Savannah sparrows apparently draw upon a wide set of models heard in both their hatching and their breeding years, incorporating specific song elements into their own song rather than copying in its entirety any particular tutor's song.

AB Early body condition commonly has important downstream effects on fitness. One, as yet unexplored, mechanism behind these effects may be that condition in early life affects time budgets and hence opportunities to learn critical skills. Meerkat, Suricata suricatta, pups must choose between begging for food from helpers and foraging for themselves. I found that pups in good condition early in life invested more time in foraging than individuals in poor condition and subsequently developed greater foraging efficiency, which was maintained in later life. Young pups spent an average of 18% of their time foraging, even though all pups were initially incompetent foragers and gained few direct bene fits from their attempts. Pups whose hunger was reduced through experimental provisioning increased their investment in foraging. This suggests that investment in foraging is mediated by available energy reserves and raises the possibility that, although foraging is energetically costly, pups may gain long-term bene fits by practising. Surprisingly, manipulating body weight through long-term experimental provisioning did not result in increased investment in foraging or improved foraging efficiency. Possible explanations for this result are considered. The findings presented here provide some support for the hypothesis that high body condition allows individuals to invest time in costly foraging practice, leading to the development of skills. These effects, acting in tandem with other processes such as differential neural development, may help to explain common links between early condition and future fitness.

AB An almost universal component of moth reproduction is the long-range attraction of males by female-produced sex pheromones. Males are hypothesized to discriminate against incomplete and aberrant blend ratios. Male moth preference functions would then be unimodal with a single optimum coincident with the mean female sex pheromone blend. The resulting variation in female mating success would impose stabilizing selection on the ratio of components in the female sex pheromone. Stabilizing male preference functions would tend to constrain pheromone evolution, reduce phenotypic variation, and eliminate heritable variation. Despite the fact that these predictions are implicit to some models of pheromone evolution, there are few studies that have examined the shape of male moth preference functions over the range of pheromone blends produced by female moths. The shape of the male almond moth preference function was estimated using choice and no-choice wind tunnel trials to a range of naturally occurring ratios of pheromone components. Choice trials documented the predicted unimodal (stabilizing selection) preference function, whereas in the no-choice trials a flat (no selection) male preference function was documented. The no-choice trials are likely to be more representative of mating opportunities under natural conditions than the choice trials, as the opportunity to choose among equally receptive and available females may be rare in the field. If choice does not occur, this may reflect historical stabilizing selection, and male mating preferences may not be stabilizing over the range of currently produced female blend ratios.

We tested motivation to reach two resources that are potentially practical enrichments: a platform (providing a partly enclosed space and a raised area) and limited social contact with another rabbit through wire mesh and compared these to food and an empty space. To reach these resources, rabbits had to pay entry costs (pushing through weighted doors) which increased every 2 days. With rising costs, rabbits generally rescheduled their behaviour, often reducing visit number and increasing visit length. Measures from economics and behavioural ecology ranked the relative importance of resources similarly (food >= social contact >= platform > empty cage). 'Travel cost consumer surplus' (the area under a demand curve of price versus number of visits) ranked food and social contact similarly, but higher than the platform; 'aggregate consumer surplus' (the area under a plot of weight against the number of rabbits paying each price level for the resource) placed food higher than both social contact and the platform; 'reservation price' (maximum weight pushed) did not discriminate between the three resources; and 'expenditure rate' (weight x visits/days) again ranked food and social contact similarly, but higher than the platform. Overall, rabbits' motivation for access to limited social contact thus came close to that for food, suggesting that they value this highly. Rabbits were almost as strongly motivated to be near a platform, but rarely used it, suggesting it might serve a 'bolt hole' function. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When provisioning offspring many bird parents give specific calls, which typically stimulate begging. Previous studies have investigated the benefits of food calling during the nestling phase, however, there is a current paucity of data on the use of food calls after young have fledged. This study describes the use of 'purr' calls, given by adult pied babblers, Turdoides bicolor, when feeding both nestlings and fledglings. Offspring associated these calls with food delivery: nestlings begged in response to experimental playbacks of purr calls; whereas fledglings, which were no longer confined to the nest, approached calling adults. As well as with feeds, adults also gave purr calls in nonfeeding contexts. Playbacks of purr calls given in feeding and nonfeeding contexts elicited the same responses, suggesting that offspring expected food when they responded to both 'feed' and 'no-feed' purr calls. Adults seemed to use the association between purr calls and food delivery by giving no-feed purr calls to promote fledgling movement, for example when leading young away from predators. Fledglings directly benefited when they approached adults who gave no-feed purr calls, despite not receiving any food. This study raises the possibility that food calling during the fledgling phase is a widespread, but understudied form of parent-offspring communication in birds and may be a more important aspect of avian parental care than is currently realized.

AB The extent and spatial pattern of song similarity in the chowchilla were examined to determine at what scale song similarity changes, and whether this pattern is indicative of the timing of learning and dispersal strategy of this rainforest passerine. We recorded songs from across the species' entire range in the Wet Tropics of Australia. Songs were divided into their syllables, and a syllable catalogue was created for the whole population. Pairwise comparisons of syllable sharing were used to calculate a similarity index for each recorded group as well as for neighbours and non-neighbours. Chowchillas have a single-song repertoire, which is primarily used in territorial defence. Chowchillas show exceptional spatial variation in their song, and song similarity was significantly correlated with distance. Song similarity decreased sharply at 1 km, confirming the existence of song neighbourhoods that share near identical songs. Neighbours shared significantly more syllables than non-neighbours. Our results are consistent with the idea that chowchillas learn their songs after dispersal when settling into a new group. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Workers of most eusocial Hymenoptera can produce sons but rarely do so in the presence of the queen, despite the potentially high fitness payoff of direct reproduction. It has often been suggested that colony-level productivity costs may outweigh the fitness advantages of worker reproduction, but this has never been shown. We estimated these costs in two ant species with large complex societies, the leafcutter ants Acromyrmex echinatior and Acromyrmex octospinosus, by splitting 16 laboratory colonies and comparing the dynamics of the fungus garden volume between orphaned and queenright nests ( with and without laying workers, respectively). Apart from fungus volume as a longitudinal measure of colony productivity, we estimated sex allocation, the timing of the switch between raising queen offspring and worker sons, and differences in body mass between queen and worker sons. We showed that orphaned nests give priority to raising dispersing queen- derived sexuals ( virgin queens, haploid and diploid queen sons) over raising worker sons. Worker sons could be heavier than, equally heavy as, or lighter than queen sons, depending on the condition of the colony. The reduction in colony productivity of orphaned nests compared to their queenright counterparts was negligible ( <= 1.2%), at least during the first 9 weeks after queen loss when these costs could be estimated. Such low costs could only outweigh the benefit of worker laying if the survival of worker sons is low, for example if workers show efficient worker policing, or discriminate against all male brood outside the brief reproductive season.

AB Animals are known to derive benefits from associating with familiar individuals, and familiarity is important in the structuring of animal groups. In fish, individuals are known to shoal preferentially with others they have previously spent time with (familiar individuals). One mechanism used in fish shoaling decisions may be local olfactory cues; individuals prefer to shoal with conspecifics that have experienced a similar recent environment to themselves. We investigated the role of diet-based cues in the social decisions of domestic guppies, Poecilia reticulata. Diet strongly affected shoaling decisions. Fish fed a bloodworm diet preferred to shoal with familiar individuals and with those that had been fed a similar diet. Flake foodfed fish, on the other hand, preferentially associated with fish fed on bloodworm, and showed a strong preference for unfamiliar fish when both shoals were fed flake food. These results suggest that several factors may interact to influence shoaling decisions. Bloodworm-fed fish also strongly preferred the olfactory cues of their own diet to flake food odour whereas flake food-fed fish showed no preference for either odour type. Fish on bloodworm diets, however, grew faster. We suggest potential explanations for the flake food-fed individuals' preference for unfamiliar fish.

AB Animals searching for prey and males searching for mates share similar problems of detection if their targets are diverse in colour or physical appearance. There is good evidence for predators switching their preferences for prey in a frequency-dependent way; predators focus on the most common form, and the decreased predation on rarer forms allows multiple forms to survive. Frequency-dependent mate selection has also been proposed to explain the maintenance of several female colour morphs in damselflies. However, the fact that one of the female morphs is coloured like a male (androchrome) and behaves similarly to males suggests the phenomenon of male mimicry in this system as an alternative explanation for the polymorphism. We compared androchrome frequencies in populations and mating pairs in Ischnura elegans, over a range of androchrome frequencies (8-90%). In 22 of 23 samples androchromes mated less often than expected (significantly in 13 samples). We found no evidence for males switching their preferences in a frequency-dependent way. A test of male preference for female morphs in a population with 85% androchromes indicated that males behaved indiscriminately and did not prefer the commonest (male-like) morph. Our results support androchrome male mimicry rather than learned mate recognition by males (a purely frequency-dependent model) as the main mechanism behind the maintenance of this sex-limited colour polymorphism.

AB Avian incubation attentiveness has important fitness consequences through its influence on the number and quality of hatched young and energetic costs imposed on parents. Nest attentiveness is highly variable across species and geographical regions. We reviewed the literature and found a worldwide pattern that nest attentiveness of passerines is generally lower in south temperate and tropical regions than in north temperate regions. We also conducted a food manipulation experiment to assess the extent to which nest attentiveness may reflect proximate responses versus an evolved behaviour. We used the karoo prinia, Prinia maculosa, in South Africa, which has very low nest attentiveness (similar to 49%) compared with that of many passerine birds. We provided supplemental food during early incubation to experimental females and compared nest attentiveness and on- and off-bout lengths of experimental and paired control females. Nest attentiveness of females at food-provisioned nests was significantly higher than that of control females (57% versus 49%). Food-supplemented females also spent significantly less time off the nest than did control females, whereas mean on-bout lengths did not differ. However, mean nest attentiveness of food-provisioned females was still substantially below that of other similar bird species worldwide. Food can be an important proximate influence on parental care behaviour, but proximate influences of food do not explain broad latitudinal patterns of attentiveness.

AB We conducted two experiments on song memorization in zebra finches using a new measure of song recognition memory. We passively exposed zebra finches to songs presented from a loudspeaker, then trained them to discriminate a subset of the exposed songs from novel ones in a Go/No-go operant discrimination between familiar and novel songs. Following discrimination training, untrained exposed and novel probe songs were presented without reinforcement. The birds generalized their responses from the training songs to the unreinforced probe songs, demonstrating recognition memory for the previously exposed probe songs. The results show that juvenile females (experiment 1) and juvenile males (experiment 2) memorize several conspecific songs through passive exposure. Song recognition memory was maintained for a minimum of 3 weeks (experiment 1), and there was no difference in recognition memory for conspecific or heterospecific songs in juvenile males that were exposed to song during the sensitive period (experiment 2). The new procedure uses the power of operant conditioning techniques to assess recognition memory, while controlling for possible artificial influences of operant procedures on the song memorization process. The findings of experiment 2 have implications for theories of selective learning of bird song. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent findings in the field of ecological stoichiometry indicate that the relationships among key macro-nutrient elements (e.g. carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) of organisms and their resources may underlie variation in fitness-conferring behaviours. The amount of phosphorus in an individual's body is often correlated with its rate of growth and reproduction, and low-phosphorus diets are known to reduce growth in a number of insect and crustacean herbivores. These findings suggest that the stoichiometric imbalance between organismal biomass requirements and the relative scarcity of nutrients in nature may underlie variation in condition-dependent behaviours. Here we investigate relationships between body elemental composition and long-distance mate attraction signals produced by male Texas field crickets, Gtyllus texensis. Signalling was strongly and positively correlated with the percentage of phosphorus present in the body, but was not correlated with the percentage of carbon or nitrogen present. We also found evidence suggesting that callers and noncalling satellites differ in their elemental composition. To our knowledge, our data are the first to indicate that there may be a relationship between total body phosphorus content and a sexually selected trait. We present a preliminary evaluation of proximate hypotheses to account for the observed patterns. Our results indicate that a stoichiometric perspective may help us to understand the causes of variation in behaviour.

AB With rare exceptions, avian offspring are continuously attended by one parent for at least the first few days after hatching. The duration of this phase of the nesting cycle is regulated by a trade-off between the benefits of brooding/guarding and those of foraging. We manipulated offspring age in grey-headed albatrosses, Thalassarche chrysostoma, by swapping chicks between nests. Parents given chicks 6 days older than their own shortened brooding by only 1.2 days, and parents given chicks 6 days younger than their own extended brooding by 1.4 days. Despite being relatively unresponsive to chick age, parents adjusted brooding in relation to calendar date and to chick condition. The results suggest that adults do not use chick age per se as a cue, but instead probably use an internal timer, and fine-tune the decision to end brooding according to date and chick mass. The duration of brood guarding did not correlate with adult body condition, suggesting that adults had a sufficient safety margin to allow them to respond to chick needs without compromising their own residual reproductive value. Chick survival at the end of brood guarding was strongly dependent on calendar date (early and late chicks suffered higher mortality), which suggests that grey-headed albatrosses benefit from breeding synchronously. We conclude that the length of the brood-guarding period is dependent on chick condition and seasonal variation in chick predation risk.

AB The function of aggressive signals, including both their information content and the circumstances under which they cause resolution or escalation of conflict, continues to be controversial. We studied the information content of aggressive songs in the house cricket, Acheta domesticus, to test their ability to inform opponents about fighting ability and motivation. We show that songs produced by individual males are highly repeatable and contain information about male resource holding potential, the ability of a male to win an aggressive contest. Temporal components of aggressive song were correlated with male body size, and size affected both the intensity and outcome of fights. In contrast, we found no components of song that signal motivation to fight. Although males with restricted access to mates were significantly more aggressive and won fights more often, their songs did not reflect the asymmetry in motivation to fight. We discuss possible reasons for the absence of signals of motivation during animal contests. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is great interest in investigating whether video can be used as an effective stimulus in avian behavioural research. Although there are clear predictions as to the efficacy and limitations of video, there are few empirical tests of whether video stimuli can elicit naturalistic behaviours in birds. Here we assess whether noninteractive digital video presented on flat thin-film transistor (TFT) monitors can be used in zebra finch mate choice studies. Specifically, we tested whether female finches prefer their pair-bonded male over an unfamiliar male when these males are presented as live birds or as noninteractive video images. Our data indicate that, when auditory cues are masked by white noise, female zebra finches strongly prefer to court unfamiliar live males. We hypothesize that the preference for unfamiliar males results from the masking of auditory cues that are crucial to pair-bond maintenance. In video stimulus trials, although females actively courted the video images of males more than they did live males in the live male trials, females did not prefer the unfamiliar males over their pair-bonded males. Therefore, noninteractive digital video presented on TFT screens solicits courtship behaviour from females but also fundamentally changes their mate preferences. We discuss these patterns in light of the possible visual and behavioural differences between the video and live male stimuli and conclude that video displayed on TFT monitors must be used with caution in mate preference studies.

AB Competition between males to reproduce has led to various forms of resource-guarding behaviour. A recent theoretical investigation suggested that guarding strategies should be closely linked to the risk of take-over and the competitive ability of males, but experimental evidence is still scarce. We investigated precopulatory mate guarding of premoult females in a solitary orb-weaving spider Zygiella x-notata (Araneae: Araneidae). We tested the hypotheses that larger males should (1) be more successful at guarding, (2) acquire their mates by usurping them from other males (take-over), and (3) start guarding females as close as possible to their final moult. In a field study, we recorded the mating activity of marked males throughout a breeding season and conducted a male removal experiment to suppress male-male competition near randomly selected guarded females. We found strong male-male competition for guarding premoult females. Male take-over occurred frequently in the population, even though guarding was efficient at locally reducing male turnover near females. Large males were overall more successful in their guarding attempts because of their higher competitive ability, but guarding success did not increase linearly with body size. Large males mainly acquired females by evicting previous guardians. They spontaneously started guarding females closer to their moult than small males; however, this was not significant when no direct competition occurred between them. We discuss possible mechanisms to explain variation in guarding duration and success and the evolution of male body size in this spider. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Territory defence can be seen as a dynamic long-term process that involves some learning. For example, a resident may adjust its territory proclamation behaviour depending on its prior experience with territorial intruders. We investigated whether short territorial challenges could have long-lasting effects on the singing behaviour of male birds. We used song playbacks to simulate intrusions into autumn territories of male winter wrens, Troglodytes troglodytes, shortly after dawn and compared male singing behaviour immediately before and I day after the simulated intrusion. As in many other bird species, unchallenged male wrens tended to sing more songs before than after sunrise. One day after a simulated intrusion, however, this pattern was much more pronounced. Males significantly increased their song output before sunrise, but maintained or even reduced song output after sunrise. This result suggests that dawn singing before sunrise is particularly important for territory defence. On the day after the intrusion, the start of dawn singing varied less between males, although the average starting time remained the same. Our findings suggest that a territorial challenge can influence singing behaviour almost 24 h after the intrusion. The amount and timing of birdsong, as a preventive territorial proclamation, can thus be adjusted to past territorial challenges. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study, of Animal Behaviour.

AB Contact calls are used to maintain cohesion and coordinate movements in social animals. The amount and type of identity information provided by contact calls are linked to social organization. Socially stable species often converge on shared group-specific contact calls. In socially fluid species, contact calls tend to be individually distinctive; evidence indicates that such calls are important for mediating individual-specific interactions. Dolphins, for example, will mimic the individually distinctive contact calls of other individuals while socializing. We examined contact calls in another fission-fusion species, the orange-fronted parakeet. Free-living and temporarily captive nonbreeding pairs as well as free-living breeding pairs were recorded. In all contexts, pairs produced multiple (up to nine) discrete contact call types, but like dolphins, typically favoured one to two individually specific variants per bird. The number of dominant variants produced and their evenness of use varied with context. Captive pairs produced the fewest dominants, using them with high evenness. Free-living nonbreeding pairs produced more dominants, and showed similarly high evenness. Breeding pairs varied widely in the number of dominants produced and their evenness of use, showing both the highest and lowest values of each. Latent acoustic measures revealed greater structural variation within and among dominants for free-living compared to captive pairs, presumably reflecting the increased opportunity for social interaction available in the wild. Across contexts, calls could be accurately assigned to pair using acoustic measures; however, within-pair call clustering was not greater than that between pairs. Pairs' calls were distinctive, but in a way that preserved individual variation.

AB Interference ideal free distribution (IFD) models predict animal distributions across resource patches, taking into account the effects of resource density and competitor interference on an individual's resource intake rate. Assuming that individuals behave to maximize fitness, foragers should aggregate at patches of high resource abundance when interference is weak. However, when interference is strong, foragers should choose to reduce interference by foraging at less crowded patches, even if these patches have lower resource density. Consequently, interference IFD predicts disproportionately high animal densities at rich patches when interference is low and a more uniform distribution among patches when interference is strong. To test this prediction we observed house sparrows, Passer domesticus, at a rich and a poor patch with different seed densities. We manipulated interference by altering the size of the pair of patches: two small patches (high interference) or two large patches (low interference). Birds experienced no interference at large patches where fighting was infrequent and preferred the rich patch where foraging rates increased with bird numbers. In contrast, birds aggressively interfered with each other at small patches, and interference was higher in rich patches than in poor patches. As predicted, birds increased their use of poor patches to minimize interference, resulting in an even distribution of birds across rich and poor patches. Our results show how changes in interference with resource density can make consumer distributions independent of resource distribution, even at moderate interference intensities. Manipulating interference through patch size may provide a unique opportunity to examine the effects of competitive asymmetries on patch use.

AB The evolutionary significance of sexual cannibalism depends on the timing of male death. Both female and male spiders possess paired genital organs and, while females can mate multiply, males of some species have limited mating rates because they can use each copulatory organ only once. By attacking a male after he has used one of his pedipalps but before he has used the other one, females may severely reduce male reproductive success. In the orb-web spider Argiope bruennichi, females attack every male during his first copulation and only 20% of virgin males survive such an attack. To measure costs and benefits associated with single versus double insertions for males, we created two double-mating treatments: we experimentally manipulated first males to use one or both of their pedipalps with a single female and then assessed paternity success of a second male (P2). Double insertions reduced P2 by increasing copulation duration rather than by increasing the number of insertions per se. When we separated the consumption of males experimentally from the act of killing, consumption had no effect on paternity. By counting sperm in used and unused peclipalps of males, we determined that sperm transfer is directly related to copula duration and that males are able to transfer 50% of their sperm load in each palp within 10 s of copulation. Our experiments revealed that sexual cannibalism after the first insertion is costly for males and we propose that these costs arise because females benefit from polyandry.

AB I analysed mate choice for indirect genetic benefits displayed by an ornament theoretically by means of a neural network model. In particular, the fitness of a choosy female was compared to that of a nonchoosy one under various ecological conditions such as variation in ornament size between males, the cost of searching, the heritability of the ornament and a correlation between 'good genes' and the phenotypic expression of the ornament. Females were allowed to choose between either six or 43 males with ornaments of various sizes. They were allowed to compare males until the largest of the presented males was chosen. I found that choosiness was favoured with increasing variation in ornament size between males, combined with a high heritability of the ornament, a very high correlation between the 'good genes' and the phenotype, and low search costs. In general, as the correlation between the 'good genes' and the phenotype decreased the variance in expected fitness of choosy females increased. The results suggest that the conditions favouring this type of mate choice are restrictive and apply only to a small set of species. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We tested the hypothesis that changes in male reproductive tactics are often associated with female receptivity or female density. We used a phylogenetic context, comparing three species of the parasitoid wasp Nasonia. Females of these species may emerge from the host puparium as virgins or having already mated (called within-host mating, WHM). Males vary in their probability of aggressively defending the host puparium after they emerge. We used six lines of Nasonia, two from each species, to test whether male aggressive tendencies were higher in species in which females emerge as virgins. During adult emergence from the host puparia, we scored female WHM and male aggressive behaviour, site fidelity and dispersal. We found a positive association between male and female behaviour at the species level. First, male N. vitripennis were highly aggressive and did not disperse, and 95% of females emerged as virgins. In contrast, N. giraulti males showed little to no aggression and a high tendency to disperse after emerging from the host, and 100% of females mated prior to emergence. Finally, for N. longicornis, both male aggressive behaviour and WHM were variable. Based on the molecular phylogeny of Nasonia, we hypothesize that the behavioural differences between males of N. vitripennis and N. giraulti represent the ancestral and derived states, respectively, and that N. longicornis is in an early stage of divergence from N. vitripennis. We suggest that WHM and decreased male aggression in male N. giraulti evolved as a response to the spread of the host generalist N. vitripennis.

AB Predators should benefit from assessing the risks posed by prey that differ in their dangerousness. Assessment might come at any phase of the predatory sequence: search/recognition, pursuit/attack and handling/subjugation. Grasshopper mice are voracious carnivores in North American deserts, feeding almost exclusively on arthropods. In certain regions, grasshopper mice co-occur with extremely neurotoxic bark scorpions, whose sting can prove lethal to vertebrates. We presented three different prey items to wild-caught grasshopper mice at several field sites in the southwestern U.S. The three items, listed in increasing order of dangerousness, were: laboratory crickets, Acheta domesticus, having few or no defences; two sister species of Vaejovis spp., a non-neurotoxic genus of scorpion; and two sister species of toxic Centruroides. Grasshopper mice made no distinctions among the prey in either the recognition or pursuit phases of the encounter, attacking crickets and both genera of scorpions with little hesitation. There were, however, significant differences in how the mice handled the three different prey types, with Centruroides requiring significantly more effort to subdue. The difficulties that mice had in dispatching Centruroides were not related to the neurotoxic components of these scorpions' venoms, to which the mice are resistant. Instead, the difficulties appeared to result from other constituents of Centruroides' venom that cause intense, short-term pain.

   CONTEXT; SYSTEM
AB In desert ants, path integration is the fundamental system of long-distance navigation. Normally, the path integrator is reset to the zero state whenever the ant returns to the starting point of its foraging journey, the nest. We investigated whether the landmark panorama characterizing the nest entrance suffices to reset the path integrator. We designed an experimental paradigm in which the position where the ants' path integrator was at the zero state (PI position) did not coincide with the position of the nest as marked by the familiar landmark panorama (LM position). Once the ants displaced from the training area to a distant test field had arrived at the PI position, the artificial landmark array defining the nest site was installed at the LM position. The ants immediately headed towards the LM position and searched there persistently. However, upon removal of the landmarks they returned to the PI position. Hence, they ignored information from their path integrator while they concentrated their search at the landmark-defined nest position, but they again relied on their continually updated path integrator as soon as the landmarks had been removed. Although their concentrated search at the LM position showed that the ants had used the landmarks as reliable cues for the position of their nest, this landmark-induced search for the nest entrance did not reset the ant's path integrator. In general, this might mean that geocentric visual cues in themselves are not sufficient to recalibrate the egocentric path integrator. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We carried out a longitudinal study on great tits from two lines bidirectionally selected for fast or slow exploratory performance during the juvenile phase, a trait thought to reflect different personalities. We analysed temporal stability and consistency of responses within and between situations involving exploratory and sociosexual behaviour. Exploratory behaviour was assessed both in the juvenile phase and in adulthood (2-3-year interval) by means of a novel object test and an open field test. We assessed agonistic behaviour twice in adulthood with a 7-month interval by confronting males with either a caged or a free-moving intruder. We assessed sexual behaviour in adulthood by presenting two caged conspecifics of the opposite sex. Exploratory scores still differed between the lines at both ages; however, slow birds became faster with age and were less stable than fast birds. Slow explorers spent more time in agonistic displays and took longer to attack than fast birds. Slow birds also took longer than fast birds to approach a member of the opposite sex. We conclude that, at the level of line, behavioural differences were stable over time and extended to other situations. At the individual level, consistency across time and situations was less evident overall, but fast birds tended to be more consistent than slow birds. Slow explorers could be described as reactive copers, showing a relatively high degree of behavioural plasticity, and fast explorers as proactive, in line with similar studies in rodents.

AB Many animals use acoustic signals to attract potential mates but are simultaneously exposed to acoustically orienting predators or parasitoids. Given the conflicting selection pressures on signal components, males that signal often might be forced to make trade-offs among these signalling components to reduce their risk of becoming prey, or because of energetic, biomechanical, or physiological limitations. We explored the conditions under which males make trade-offs among components of signalling effort in the Texas field cricket, Gryllus texensis. Male Texas field crickets show extensive variation in the effort they allocate to mate attraction. We predicted that males with high and low signalling effort should show different covariances among the number of bouts produced per hour, average bout duration and average trilling amplitude. We found that high-effort males showed strong trade-offs between bout duration and hourly bout number and between trill amplitude and hourly bout number, whereas low-effort males showed no trade-offs between any of their trilling components. Our results suggest that males using different signalling efforts may experience different selective regimes on their trilling behaviour. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ability to accurately assess local predation risk is crucial, as it allows prey individuals to maximize trade-offs between predator avoidance and foraging behaviour. Here, we test the hypothesis that juvenile convict cichlids, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, rely on ambient chemosensory information to make threat-sensitive foraging decisions. In experiment 1, juvenile cichlids were exposed to conspecific chemical alarm cues above or below the threshold required to elicit an overt antipredator response and were allowed to forage on a choice of horizontal (on the substrate) or vertical (perpendicular to the substrate) food patches. Although cichlids exposed to a subthreshold alarm cue did not show an overt antipredator response, they significantly increased their use of the vertical food patch (head-up foraging posture). Cichlids exposed to a suprathreshold alarm cue significantly reduced foraging and aggressive behaviour and shifted to the head-up foraging position. In experiment 2, juvenile cichlids were exposed to the odour of an adult conspecific fed a vegetable diet, or one of two prey fish diets (juvenile cichlids or swordtails, Xiphophorus hellerii), or a distilled water control. Although we found no evidence of an overt antipredator response towards any of the stimuli, cichlids exposed to the odour of predators fed a prey fish diet significantly increased their use of the head-up foraging posture. Our results clearly show that juvenile cichlids are able to adjust their foraging patterns in a threat-sensitive fashion in response to ambient chemosensory information.

AB Among poeciliid fish, male sexual harassment is often intense and is costly for females. In Gambusia holbrooki, sexual harassment can greatly reduce female foraging efficiency when an isolated female is harassed by a single male and these costs are negatively correlated with male length. However, when females are in groups, male harassment is diluted and female foraging efficiency increases. When several males compete for the same female, mating attempts are monopolized by the dominant male and female foraging efficiency also increases. We tested whether females actively vary their schooling behaviour with conspecifics according to the presence of a harassing male. Consistent with the predictions, we found that females swam closer to each other when a male was visible. When chased by a male, females approached a group of males, and when males of different size were available, they preferred to stay close to large males. These results suggest that female schooling behaviour is a flexible strategy and that male sexual harassment may represent an important factor influencing social aggregation in poeciliids.

AB We explored behavioural adjustments made by parent house sparrows, Passer domesticus, when the nutritional condition of their dependent nestlings was improved experimentally. Male parents responded to artificially supplemented broods by increasing food deliveries, whereas female parents continued matching the already high rate of control females. Thus, parental care was not truncated in the face of fortified offspring, but actually escalated (ca. 17% more adult food deliveries overall). Supplemented nestlings showed a nonsignificant tendency to recruit into the adult breeding population more than controls. We propose that one important reason why male parents responded more strongly than their female partners centres on the lower marginal costs for additional male posthatching investment, specifically by demonstrating that increasing paternal investment is likely to confer higher fitness than alternative male activities.

AB The timing of twilight transition behaviour of diurnal reef fish is likely to be determined by the trade-off between food intake and risk of predation. However, the correspondence between fish behaviour and light-dependent feeding is poorly documented. We used flume measurements of prey detection and consumption by small reef-dwelling zooplanktivorous fish to examine the effects of light and prey flux on the fish's in situ behaviour during twilight. Feeding rates increased from nearly nil to saturation as light level increased, corresponding to about 45 min of the morning twilight. Changes in feeding rates were mostly due to light-dependent changes in reactive distance. In the reef, fish emerged from their nocturnal shelter at lower light intensities than those at which they retreated at dusk. These light intensities at which the fish emerged and retreated in the field greatly exceeded the level required to detect prey. We examined whether the approach of measuring relative ratio of mortality risk to food gained can be applied to predict the observed patterns in the twilight transition behaviour of the fish studied. We suggest that both the times of emergence and retreat and the dawn-dusk asymmetry are the result of a direct response to temporal and spatial variations in predation risk; no evidence for fine-tuned adjustments to diel fluctuations in food availability by changes in the time of emergence and retreat was found.

AB We examined whether experience of opaque or transparent screens modulates the use of spatial cues by domestic chicks. From 10-12 days of age, chicks could lose sight of an imprinting stimulus or their cagemate in cages with opaque screens, but were largely unable to do so in cages with transparent screens. Chicks were then trained to find the imprinting stimulus behind one of two screens. Unrewarded probe tests were presented to chicks with the apparatus rotated by 180 degrees so that proximal (intra-apparatus) and distal (extra-apparatus) cues indicated opposite sides of the apparatus. In tests with two distinctly different screens, chicks using the left eye (LES) chose the distal side more than the proximal side, whereas chicks using the right eye (RES) chose the proximal side more than the distal side. When using both eyes (BIN) in tests with different screens, chicks reared in cages with opaque screens were quicker in making a choice, and tended to choose the screen on the distal side more often than chicks reared in cages with transparent screens. Chicks reared in cages with opaque screens failed to make a choice less often than chicks reared in cages with transparent screens in BIN tests with different screens and in monocular tests with identical screens. The results suggest that chicks using the LES are less easily disrupted by conflicting spatial cues than chicks using the RES, and that experience of visual barriers from 10-12 days of age improves the chick's ability to attend to distal cues.

AB Female burrower bugs (Sehirus cinctus, Hemiptera: Cydnidae) show extended care for their offspring. They guard their clutch and feed the hatched nymphs up to the third larval instar. Previous research indicated that nymphs partly regulate maternal food provisioning, but how nymphs accomplish this is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that nymphs solicit maternal provisioning by condition-dependent chemical signalling and we postulated the existence of a solicitation pheromone. Clutches of 30 nymphs were hand-reared in either low- or high-food conditions. After moult to second instar, cuticular compounds were extracted in hexane. An independent set of test mothers caring for offspring were subsequently exposed to extracts of nymphs from either the low- or the high-food treatment. Two control groups were also involved, one exposed to the solvent hexane and one with no treatment. As predicted for a solicitation pheromone, test mothers exposed to extracts from nymphs reared under low food provisioned more than those exposed to extracts from nymphs reared under high-food treatment. Contrary to our expectation, however, nymph extracts had an overall inhibiting effect on maternal provisioning. The effects of extract exposure on maternal provisioning were short-lasting, suggesting that the critical cues may be volatile. Our results suggest complex chemical communication in burrower bug families for the short-term regulation of maternal provisioning, potentially involving both provisioning-releasing solicitation pheromones and inhibiting chemical cues.

AB Several classes of pigments impart flamboyant colours on animals, including the red, orange and yellow carotenoids. Carotenoid-based colours have served as ideal models for studying the honesty-reinforcing mechanisms underlying sexually selected traits, because the very pigments used to become colourful also have antioxidant and immunoregulatory properties that allow individuals to signal their superior health to prospective mates. It is unclear, however, whether other chemical colourants in animals confer similar physiological benefits. Here I make the observation that the other major groups of animal pigments, including melanins, pterins, porphyrins, psittacofulvins and flavonoids, also exhibit antioxidant activity in living systems. Thus, many types of pigment-based colour ornaments in animals have the potential to honestly reveal health state via the immunomodulatory action of the pigments themselves. To evaluate this hypothesis, the extent to which these sets of pigments serve antioxidant functions in colourful animals and to which animals face a trade-off shunting pigments to physiological functions versus colour displays should be investigated.

AB Game theory has been used to provide theoretical solutions for the evolutionary stability of biparental care given sexual conflict between parents. Existing models predict that, should one parent reduce its care, the mate should adjust its care facultatively to compensate partially. This has been tested mostly on birds with equivocal results. To examine the generality of this prediction, we tested for facultative adjustments in care in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, where both parents regurgitate predigested carrion to their offspring. Females were considerably more involved than males in direct care of the larvae before mate removal. Males adjusted their care significantly after female removal, whereas females showed no response to male removal. Thus, only male behaviour was consistent with theoretical predictions. There was no evidence that male or female removal had detrimental effects on offspring fitness. We suggest that both the differential response by males and females to mate removal and the lack of a fitness effect of mate removal reflected the sex difference in the involvement in care before removal. Male removal had no effect on larval fitness simply because male involvement in care before removal was low, whereas female removal had no effect because males adjusted their behaviour after female removal. Our study reinforces the potential for alternative responses to mate removal in species with biparental care, and highlights the need for theoreticians to develop models that explore the conditions under which biparental care can be evolutionarily stable when parents engage in multiple parental behaviours.

AB Sexual cannibalism may influence expression of elaborate male traits by either reinforcing or opposing sexual selection. Male Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz) wolf spiders (Lycosidae) have tufts of bristles on the first pair of legs that may function as a condition-indicating signal trait. We paired virgin and previously mated adult females with males under seminatural conditions (laboratory containers with leaf litter). For males encountering virgin females, probability of attempted prematincy cannibalism varied with male size, body condition, tuft size, fluctuating asymmetry of tufts (FA) and female size (larger females attacked smaller males and males in poor condition with smaller, more asymmetrical tufts). Probability of successful cannibalism varied with the relative size of both sexes and female body condition, but not male tuft size (smaller males were cannibalized by larger females in better condition). Males with larger tufts (relative to body size) were more likely to mate, but no other traits (male or female) were associated with mating success. Postmating cannibalism risk was associated with female size and age, and male size, body, condition and tuft size (larger, older females cannibalized smaller males in poor condition with smaller tufts). For males paired with previously mated females, probability of cannibalism was influenced by size of both sexes and male tuft size (larger females cannibalized smaller males with smaller tufts). While no morphological characteristics (male or female) influenced the probability of second matings, recently matured females were more likely to mate twice. Results suggest that both mate choice and sexual cannibalism can impose reinforcing directional selection on male size and secondary sexual characters.

AB Trophically transmitted parasites may increase their transmission efficiency by altering the behaviour of infected hosts to increase their susceptibility to predation by target hosts (the next host in the life cycle). The parasite Diplostomum spathaceum (Trematoda) reduces the vision of its fish intermediate hosts: its metacercariae lodge themselves in the eyes of fish and induce cataract formation, which gives them the opportunity to affect fish behaviour. We examined whether D. spathaceum eye flukes change the preference of fish for the surface layers of the water column or their escape behaviour, which could make the fish more vulnerable to predation by bird hosts. We also studied the influence of parasites on the susceptibility of fish to artificial aerial predators that were able to catch fish from the water surface. Infected and control fish did not differ in their preference for the surface layers but infected fish showed less escape behaviour when a black plate was drawn over the water surface. They were also more easily caught by human 'predators' dipping a net into the tank. Thus, infected fish should be easier prey for gulls and terns, implying that the ability of D. spathaceum eye flukes to alter fish behaviour may be a parasite strategy evolved to enhance transmission.

AB We studied 26 reproductive groups of swift foxes, Vulpes velox, from both high- and low-density areas during three field seasons in northwestern Texas, U.S.A., to examine whether differences in population density affect mating system and group structure. Although high- and low-density populations were only separated by 46 km and vegetation and diets were similar between sites, polygynous groups, communal denning and nonbreeding females occurred in the area of high density, whereas only monogamous pairs occurred in the area of low density. Annual survival of adult swift foxes was 66% in the area of high density, but 44% in the area of low density. Predation from coyotes, Canis latrans, was the only mortality factor that differed (P = 0.01) between sites and contributed most to differences in survival. Although previous research indicated that variation in social systems among canids is related to bottom-up forces (i.e. food, habitat), the results of our study indicate that variation in social systems can also be related to top-down forces (i.e. predation, displacement by larger competitor).

   SELECTION; CALLING SONG; ORTHOPTERA; CRICKET; REPEATABILITY; PATTERNS
AB In the duetting grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus, a female's decision to reply to a conspecific male is based on the evaluation of a number of features of the male's song, which consists of uninterrupted syllables separated by pauses. Female responses are tuned to a restricted range of pause durations. However, males produce songs with noisy rather than silent pauses, which should make the measurement of pause durations more difficult for the female. We examined the adaptive value of these noisy pauses by testing female responses to (1) pairs of natural phrases, which differed only with respect to clear or noisy syllable pauses, and (2) synthetic phrases, in which the syllable onset accentuations and noise levels in the pauses were systematically varied. There was considerable variation between females, both in their preference for clear or noisy pauses in natural phrases, and in the optimal combinations of syllable onset accentuations and noise levels in pauses that they preferred in synthetic phrases. The response profiles of individual females were consistent. The experiments with synthetic phrases showed that, on average, females preferred more extreme values of syllable onset accentuations than were present in male songs. Noisy pauses increased the range of syllable pause durations accepted by females. The results suggest that noisy pauses could buffer signallers against the negative consequences of both signal degradation during transmission and extreme receiver choosiness.

AB Understanding the relationships among variables can be difficult if the variables covary with time. Using a simple, commonly used statistical procedure to control for the passage of time, we demonstrate that some hormonal changes traditionally assumed to be causally related to the transition from sexual to parental behaviour can be explained by seasonal changes in the hormones and the fact that parental behaviour follows sexual behaviour in the course of breeding. We quantified immunoreactive prolactin (ir-prolactin) and testosterone concentrations in laboratory-housed and free-living male American kestrels, Falco sparverius, over the course of the breeding season and during sexual and parental phases of reproduction. We found that ir-prolactin increased while testosterone decreased with the transition from sexual to parental behaviour. ir-Prolactin increased with date (i.e. seasonally), whereas testosterone peaked when the frequency of clutch initiation was greatest and then decreased with date thereafter. Controlling for the effects of date eliminated the change in ir-prolactin associated with the transition from sexual to parental behaviour, revealing that prolactin variation associated with this behavioural transition in male kestrels is due, in large part, to seasonal changes in hormone concentrations and the serial nature of these behavioural states. Controlling for the effects of date further revealed that the testosterone difference between sexual and parental males decreases seasonally. It is possible that other phenomena traditionally attributed to environmental, behavioural, social, or other variables also may be explained by the association between such variables and the passage of time.

AB A high-quality home can be a major factor determining fitness. However, when house hunting becomes necessary, animals might often face a speed-versus-accuracy trade-off and therefore be unable to survey their environment extensively for the optimum site. We found that the ant Leptothorax albipennis was able to correct errors made in such a hurried decision by continuing to survey even after a colony had settled in a nest site. Colonies moved from intact undisturbed nests to another nest site whenever the new nest site presented a sufficient improvement in nest quality. Thus, scout ants must be able to judge and compare the quality of the new, empty nest site with the one currently inhabited by the colony. Emigrations from intact nests were initiated by high numbers of ants recruited by tandem runs. This evidence may explain how a small number of scouts can motivate an entire colony to move when there is no immediate need to do so. Compared with their behaviour in emigrations from destroyed nests, the ants favoured even more strongly accuracy over speed, because they waited for a larger number of scouts to agree on one site before starting the emigration. They could do this without increased risk because the rest of the colony remained safely in the old nest. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Females in many socially monogamous birds copulate hundreds of times more than necessary for fertilization, although little is known about the benefits of this excess. Females may not directly benefit from high copulation rates, but instead may exploit male interest in copulating to obtain benefits. In species with courtship feeding, females may trade copulations for food (immediate benefits hypothesis). F tested this hypothesis by analysing female behaviour during courtship in yellow-legged gulls, Larus cachinnans. Female gulls to some extent controlled sperm transfer, because they moved during copulation bouts, and this behaviour influenced the number of cloacal contacts, per mounting that the male achieved. Female control was related to previous feeding by the male, and hence the male courtship feeding rate correlated with the cloacal contact rate. Males that give more food probably enhance their chances of fathering offspring. By analysing within-individual female behaviour, I also found that the number of cloacal contacts was higher when the male fed the female than when he did not, which indicates that female gulls followed a decision rule to resist copulation when food is not given. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that-female gulls manipulate their mates to obtain food. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Visiting breeding patches can allow prospecting individuals to gather information on local patch quality to make optimal decisions about selecting a breeding habitat in the following year. This prospecting behaviour has been described in many bird species. However, the nature of the information gathered by prospectors often remains unknown. We collected data on prospecting behaviour in the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, a small hole-nesting passerine bird, to investigate whether prospectors could gather information on their conspecifics' reproductive success, that is, 'public information'. If they could, they would be expected to inspect conspecific nests, prospect at the time when public information is reliable, and be attracted to, and spend time at, successful sites. Prospecting at conspecific nests was frequent. Prospectors were mainly males, and prospecting activity closely matched the peak of nesting activity. The probability of observing a prospector at a nest increased with parental activity, measured by feeding rate and vigilance behaviour, but did not depend on direct measures of success of the inspected nest (nestling number and condition), or on female characteristics. Because feeding rate and vigilance behaviour were predictors of breeding success at fledging, prospectors were attracted to the most successful nests when cueing on conspicuous parental activity. Therefore, prospectors could gather accurate information on local conspecific reproductive success that may be used for breeding patch choice in the following year. We discuss alternative explanations for our results, and the need to test experimentally whether prospectors gather public information. We also discuss the role of breeding constraints on, and the origin of sex differences in, prospecting. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Adult male Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus, avoid contact with their young on the day that the young are born. However, on succeeding days, fathers spend nearly as much time in contact with their offspring as do mothers. We undertook a series of studies to investigate the causes of the day-to-day change in male parental behaviour. In experiment 1, we tested males' response to pups before, after and on the day of their mates' parturition, and found that males were more parental both before and after the day of birth of their young than on that day. In experiment 2, we compared the parental behaviour of males paired either with intact or with ovariectomized dams (which do not come into postpartum oestrus) and found that males that were mated to intact females were less attentive to pups on the day of their birth than were the males mated to ovariectomized females. In experiment 3, we compared the parental responses of castrated and intact males to newborn pups and found that castrated males were more parental than intact males. In experiment 4, we compared the parental responses of males that were exposed to postpartum oestrous females but prevented from mating for 24 h. Extending the period of male sexual arousal to 24 h inhibited paternal responsiveness to neonates for 24 h. We interpret these results as being consistent with the hypothesis that on the day of birth of a litter, a male's parental behaviour is inhibited by the motivation to mate during his partner's postpartum oestrus.

AB The convict cichlid fish, Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, is biparental: the male spends the majority of his time defending the territory and the female spends much of her time close to the offspring. Under natural conditions, this separation into sex-typical roles is somewhat blurred as males do spend some time with the offspring and females do attack intruders. Here we tested whether an individual selects a parental role based on the location (i.e. parental role) of its mate. For example, do females emphasize offspring care because the male is away from the offspring? Will males be more likely to care for the offspring when the female is away from the offspring? We manipulated the location of one parent by placing it in a transparent plastic box, either near the offspring or at the far end of the tank near a clear plastic compartment that held a conspecific male intruder. We tested both male and female parent under the following four conditions: boxed mate near offspring with no intruder present, boxed mate near offspring with intruder present, boxed mate near intruder compartment with no intruder present, and boxed mate near intruder compartment with intruder present. We found that both parents spent more time with the offspring and less time attacking the intruder when the mate was positioned near the offspring and more time away from the offspring and more time attacking the intruder when the mate was near the intruder. Males were more affected by the location of their mates than were females and we concluded that males were attracted both to their mates' location and their offspring while females were mostly attracted to their offspring. Overall, the location of the mate had little effect on the types of aggressive activities used against the intruder. We did find that males increased their aggression towards boxed females when they were positioned far from the offspring, whereas the aggressive behaviour of females towards boxed males when they were positioned near the offspring was ambiguous. We suggest that males in particular enforce the separation of sex-specific parental roles via this aggression.

AB The dilution effect as an antipredation behaviour is the main theoretical reason for grouping in animals and states that all individuals in a group have an equal risk of being predated if equally spaced from each other and the predator. Stalking predators, however, increase their chance of attack success by preferentially targeting nonvigilant individuals, potentially making relative vigilance rates in a group relatively important in determining predation compared with the dilution effect. Many predators, however, attack opportunistically without stalking, when targeting of nonvigilant individuals may be less likely, so that the dilution effect will then be a relatively more important antipredation reason for grouping. We tested whether an opportunistically hunting predator, the sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, preferentially attacked vigilant or feeding prey models presented in pairs. We found that sparrowhawks attacked vigilant and feeding mounts at similar frequencies. Our results suggest that individuals should prioritize maximizing group size or individual vigilance dependent on the type of predator from which they are at risk. When the most likely predator is a stalker, individuals should aim to have the highest vigilance levels in a group, and there may be relatively little selective advantage to being in the largest group. In contrast, if the most likely predator is an opportunist, then individuals should simply aim to be in the largest group and can also spend more time foraging without compromising predation risk. For most natural systems this will mean a trade-off between the two strategies dependent on the frequency of attack of each predator type. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Can social behaviour be probabilistic? Classical results in evolutionary game theory seem to suggest that recognizable asymmetries between individuals in the likelihood of winning fights (i.e. in resource holding power, RHP) rule out the stable probabilistic behaviour associated with mixed strategies. Here, using a variant of the hawk-dove game, I show that these mixed strategies can be common in asymmetric contests, because opponents of similar RHP benefit by ignoring discernable differences to form RHP equivalence categories. This process of categorizing (i.e. opting not to distinguish an opponent's discernably different RHP from one's own) can be adaptive when assessment is imprecise or expensive and mistakes can lead to dangerous combat. For large RHP differences between opponents, discriminating by acting on the discernable RHP difference is evolutionarily stable. For moderate RHP differences, typically neither categorizing nor discriminating is stable, but categorizing predominates if social interactions are frequent. More frequent interactions imply that the social status ultimately achieved is more important in accumulating fitness; this reduces the probability that a loser in combat will accept the submissive role without additional fighting, where this probability of 'surrender' expresses another mixed strategy. These patterns appear to fit the establishment of social relationships in some species for which combat is dangerous, and the analysis represents a step towards understanding the emergence of dominance hierarchies.

AB Colour pattern variation is a striking and widespread phenomenon. Differential predation risk between individuals is often invoked to explain colour variation, but empirical support for this hypothesis is equivocal. We investigated differential conspicuousness and predation risk in two species of Australian rock dragons, Ctenophorus decresii and C. vadnappa. To humans, the coloration of males of these species varies between 'bright' and 'dull'. Visual modelling based on objective colour measurements and the spectral sensitivities of avian visual pigments showed that dragon colour variants are differentially conspicuous to the visual system of avian predators when viewed against the natural background. We conducted field experiments to test for differential predation risk, using plaster models of 'bright' and 'dull' males. 'Bright' models were attacked significantly more often than 'dull' models suggesting that differential conspicuousness translates to differential predation risk in the wild. We also examined the influence of natural geographical range on predation risk. Results from 22 localities suggest that predation rates vary according to whether predators are familiar with the prey species. This study is among the first to demonstrate both differential conspicuousness and differential predation risk in the wild using an experimental protocol.

AB We evaluated the possible use of a sexually dimorphic plumage trait as a status signal in inter- and intrasexual social interactions in free-living house sparrows, Passer domesticus. Males with larger black throat patches (bibs) tended to be dominant regardless of the opponent's sex. This relationship was maintained after controlling for body size and age in multivariate analyses. However, the nature of social interactions varied according to the sex of the opponent and a male's bib size. Males with larger bibs tended to be less aggressive to male opponents, and received significantly less aggression from those birds, a key predicted benefit of a status signal. However, when the opponent was a female, males with large bibs displayed significantly more aggression than males with small bibs, and this relationship persisted even after controlling for the dominance status of the participants. Females were significantly more aggressive towards male opponents than towards female opponents, and females interacting with two males of known bib size were more aggressive to the one with the larger bib. These results suggest that the bib of male house sparrows may be a signal of status, but that in interactions with females, the bib may also have other functions. Frequent testing by females of the underlying quality being signalled by the bib may be linked to later mate choice, and might be adaptive if the information value of the bib varies among years. Such testing may also contribute to mechanisms for maintaining the bib as a reliable signal of status.

AB The importance of bird song in sexual selection and the widespread existence of geographical variation in song has raised the question of whether dialects can promote the evolution of new, reproductively isolated, subgroups. However, the effect of song learning on the relation between song divergence and gene flow is still poorly understood. We explored the origin and maintenance of song divergence and its consequences for male dispersal between populations. To do this, we used a spatially explicit model to study the effect of vocal learning mode (predispersal and postdispersal) and the role of intrasexual selection among males. The majority of scenarios simulated in the model led to significant genetic and phenotypic song divergence, consistent with the widespread occurrence of dialects in natural populations. Intrasexual selection in the form of male exclusion, dependent on song matching between neighbours, was an efficient mechanism driving song divergence. Most importantly, song learning was decisive in causing an incongruence of genetic divergence and song divergence between populations. As a consequence, song learning often prevented the expected negative relation between the degree of song divergence and dispersal. These findings may help to interpret empirical data on song divergence and gene flow and provide qualitative and testable predictions for conditions under which intraspecific song variation may promote reproductive divergence and speciation.

AB We conducted three experiments to test the effects of mating history of both sexes and of male body size on mating behaviours in the water strider, Gerris buenoi. Our manipulations influenced the interests of both sexes and, thus, the degree of conflict over mating behaviours. Mating history was a dichotomous variable (deprived/mated), depending on holding conditions in the laboratory. Experiment I considered and found independent effects of male and female mating history on latency to copulation and copulation duration. In experiment 2, we manipulated only female mating history, using unsuccessful struggle rates as evidence for female reluctance and conflict over mating. Finally, we investigated the relation between male body size and mating history on copulation duration. We predicted that intersexual conflict over mating would be lowest when females were deprived, because female interests under these conditions should more closely match those of males. Deprived females began mating in half the time of mated females and were twice as likely to mate because of reduced reluctance. Furthermore, copulation duration for deprived males was about one and a half times longer than that for mated males. Although previous studies examining nonrandom mating patterns by size predicted longer copulations for small males, we found that small males prolonged copulation when deprived more than large males. We conclude that females primarily influence copulation frequency, but males primarily influence copulation duration. Our results favour the hypothesis that reduced mating opportunity for small males accounts for their extended copulation duration. Finally, our findings provide evidence for strong effects of male body size on selection mechanisms in water striders, and support the hypothesis of conflicting pre- and postcopulatory selection mechanisms in this group.

AB We report experimental results consistent with the hypothesis that constraints on the expression of male mating preferences affect breeder fitness, offspring viability and performance. If constraints on the expression of mating preferences are common, tests of fitness variation associated with mate preferences must eliminate as many constraints on mate preferences as possible. We tested whether male mate preferences influenced breeder fitness, offspring performance and viability in typically polygynous house mice, Mus domesticus, from a feral source population. Our 'free mate choice' trials not only eliminated female preferences, male-male and female-female competition, but also our best guesses of. the traits mediating choosers' preferences. Males mated with their preferred (P) females sired more litters than males mated with their nonpreferred (NP) females. Offspring viability was significantly lower when males' reproduced with females they did not prefer compared with females they did prefer. Adult sons of males that mated with their P females were socially dominant to sons of males that mated with their NP females. Adult offspring from P pairings built better nests than offspring from NP pairings. The slope of the survivorship curve for P offspring was significantly higher than for NP offspring. These results showed (1) males' mate preferences affected their fitness, (2) males that mated with females they preferred produced more-litters than males that mated with females they did not prefer, and (3) their offspring were significantly more viable and performed significantly better on standardized performance tests. This is the first demonstration of fitness benefits of male choice behaviour in a mammal species with typical paternal investment. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The price and income elasticities of demand have been used by ethologists to estimate motivational strength. The consumer surplus is an alternative measure of motivation, deriving from microeconomic theory. We made a theoretical assessment of the validity and versatility of these indices. Two factors are expected to compromise the internal validity (veracity) of the elasticity of demand indices: failure to take into account the amount that an animal is required to pay to maintain some level of consumption; and a tendency to confuse its readiness to defend a preferred consumption level with a propensity to become satiated. A third factor, expected to compromise the external validity (usefulness) of these indices, is the unrealistic assumption that a single value can be assigned to each resource. None of these problems applies to the consumer surplus index. One further factor, expected to compromise the internal validity of both the consumer surplus and price elasticity indices, is their failure to account for the effects that income has upon consumption. Overall, we conclude that the consumer surplus should be more valid, both internally and externally, than the price elasticity index. The consumer surplus should also be more externally valid than the income elasticity index, but it is unclear, on balance, which of these indices is the more internally valid. Finally, we show that both elasticity indices are considerably less versatile than the consumer surplus, owing to the assumption that a single value can be assigned to each resource.

AB Food mixing by herbivores is thought to balance nutrient intake and possibly dilute secondary metabolites characteristic of different host plant species. Most empirical work on insect herbivores has focused on nutrient balancing in laboratory settings. In this study, we characterize food mixing behaviour of the caterpillar Grammia geneura (Strecker) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) in nature and use the observed patterns to design ecologically relevant experiments that reveal the relative importance of these processes in food-switching behaviour. Our design involved both choice and no-choice experiments with chemically defined diets in which primary nutrients and secondary metabolites were manipulated in tandem. We analysed two stages in the process of food-switching behaviour: leaving food and accepting new food. In nature, an individual's rate of leaving host plants was positively associated with its probability of rejecting plant species most recently eaten, but not related to its probability of accepting different host plant species. Furthermore, an individual's leaving rate was negatively related to its average feeding bout duration. This relationship resulted partly from variation in the response of individuals to nutrient imbalance and partly from shortened feeding bouts prior to switching, suggesting that a decline in feeding excitation preceded searching for food that differed from that most recently eaten. Laboratory experiments with synthetic diets indicated the importance of secondary metabolites in the decline in feeding excitation prior to switching. Preference for new food depended strongly on secondary metabolites in a manner consistent with toxin dilution. This is the first experimental evidence for the process of toxin dilution in caterpillars, and for the combined influence of nutrients and secondary metabolites on their foraging patterns in nature.

AB Repeatable differences in preference between females are a prerequisite for the evolution of female choice. Existing studies have concentrated on the repeatability of female preference for the male trait eliciting the highest female response but have rarely dealt with female choosiness and response rate, which are also important traits for the evolution of female choice and can mimic repeatable variation in preference. We used a method devised to disentangle the effects of preference, choosiness and response rate to examine the repeatability of female choice for acoustic signals in the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus. We stimulated females with artificial courtship signals that varied in one signal trait and recorded the number of acoustic responses of the females in two sessions separated by several days. Using a normal distribution function within a nonlinear regression between signalling trait and female response rate, we independently calculated values for female preference, choosiness and maximum response rate for the two sessions. All three aspects of female choice showed significant repeatability indicating large differences between females. This method will also be suitable for measuring the heritability of female preference, a crucial question regarding the evolution of female choice.

AB We carried out a combination of field and laboratory experiments to investigate two possible mechanisms promoting the evolution of lekking in the sandfly, Lutzomyia longipalpis. Males in this species lek on or near hosts that females visit to mate and feed. To test whether the distribution of resources, lek size and female number were positively correlated (a prediction of hotspot models) we manipulated the availability of potential lek sites by varying the numbers of chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, held in field cages. We then investigated the distribution of males and females across leks formed within these cages and measured males to assess the relationship between male size and lek size, The number of males attracted to a lek increased with the number of hosts present and on average males on larger leks had longer abdomens. The number of females was positively correlated with the number of males present, but the average number of females per male decreased with increasing lek size. In a second experiment, we introduced single females to laboratory leks of different sizes, and compared female latency to mate. Contrary to an explicit prediction of the black hole model, lek size had a direct effect on a female's latency to mate. Females at larger leks encountered and copulated with males sooner than those at smaller aggregations, but the length of time a pair spent courting did not vary with lek size. Our results suggest that the black hole model is unlikely to explain the evolution of lekking in this species. The data instead support the hotspot model as a possible mechanism promoting lekking in L. longipalpis but suggest that female preference for larger leks may need to be invoked to obtain the degree of aggregation observed. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID NATIONAL-PARK; EVOLUTION; DOMINANCE; COERCION; ATELES
AB Current models of chimpanzee social structure differ in the extent to which females range with the males and are loyal to a particular social group. We tested these models by analysing 18 years of observational data on the Gombe chimpanzees to investigate the relationship between female space use patterns and both female feeding competition and changes in the male-defended range boundaries. Females at Gombe typically spend most of their time in small overlapping core areas within the community range. Most core areas clustered into two neighbourhoods, north and south. Most females maintained a high degree of site fidelity, but altered their space use patterns to stay within a male-defended boundary. This overall pattern supports the male-bonded model of the chimpanzee social system, over the bisexual or male-only community models, but there are many exceptions. Some females were very peripheral and may have associated simultaneously with two communities. Others switched communities as adults. Thus, different individual females displayed a variety of space use patterns. Different space use patterns of individual females were associated with differences in reproductive success. Members of the northern neighbourhood had higher reproductive success than those of the south, and peripheral individuals either did very well or very poorly. Females that moved from one community to another as adults produced the fewest surviving offspring. These results suggest that female ranging patterns are influenced by both feeding competition and male territorial behaviour. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Female spiders have two separate reproductive tracts, one on each side of the body, which receive and store sperm. Thus, females may be virgin or nonvirgin on both sides, or virgin on one side and nonvirgin on the other side. To examine whether male orb-weaving spiders, G. cancriformis, respond differentially to females based on mating history, we presented mates to (1) virgin females, (2) females that had previously mated with one of their two tracts and (3) females that had mated previously with both reproductive tracts. Prior to copulation, males showed no differential responses in terms of latency to courtship, number of courtship bouts, number of insertion attempts, or latency to copulation. Female mating history influenced copulatory frequency and sperm release by the male, but not duration of copulation. Nearly all males copulated twice with virgin females, once with each reproductive tract. They released nearly all sperm contained in their palps. Males that encountered nonvirgin reproductive tracts were more likely to depart after a single copulation without attempting a second. Such males rarely released sperm, but the few that did released as many as males mating with virgin tracts. Thus, sperm were released in an all-or-none fashion. Female mating history did not influence the frequency of intersexual cannibalism. This suggests that differential response by males is more likely related to female patterns of sperm use than to high levels of intersexual killing.

AB We tested the ability of amphisbaenians, Blanus cinereus, a fossorial and almost blind reptile, to detect and discriminate odours from potential predators and to show the corresponding defensive response. Amphisbaenian behaviour was observed in tubes, where we recorded the tongue-flick rate to swabs impregnated with odours of (1) a southern smooth snake, Coronella girondica, which feeds on amphisbaenians, (2) a scolopendromorph centipede (Scolopendra sp.), which are aggressive prey species that can seriously damage amphisbaenians, and (3) Bedriaga's skink, Chalcides bedriagai, a semifossorial reptile innocuous to amphisbaenians. Cologne odour and deionized water were used as pungent and nonodoriferous controls. The amphisbaenians responded to the chemical cues by increased tongue-flick rates, with the highest rates being given in response to the snake and centipede, showing that they were able to detect and discriminate the odours arising from potentially harmful species. The chemical exploration of these odours also induced defensive responses. The amphisbaenians bit or retreated from the applicators bearing snake and centipede odours, whereas skink odour did not elicit defensive responses. In addition, they showed more stress and antipredator behaviours, fled rapidly and later became less mobile during trials with the snake or centipede odours, but produced different complexes of defensive responses to each one. These results indicate that chemical cues of a predator may elicit specific defensive antipredator behaviours in amphisbaenians. We discuss the possible evolutionary advantage of identifying and avoiding potential predators in relation to fossoriality. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Isolated individuals of most species are thought to be at a higher risk of mortality from starvation and predation than those in groups. However, supporting evidence remains scant. As part of a broader study of grey-cheeked mangabey, Lophocebus albigena, dispersal in Kibale National Park, Uganda between October 1996 to February 1999, we investigated starvation and mortality risks within a sample of 27 radiotagged mangabey males. Each male was contacted on average three times a week to collect data on spatial relations, habitat use, activity patterns and fates. We assessed risks by comparing data from 'isolated' (greater than or equal to 200 m from the group) males with data from 'within-group' males. We assessed starvation risks by comparing proportions of time spent in feeding, foraging and moving, comparing rates of movement during focal samples, and comparing proportions of time that males spent in different habitat types and canopy levels. We assessed mortality risks by comparing scanning rates and mortality events of within-group and isolated males. Isolated males spent significantly more time scanning, but we could detect no other significant differences in time allocated to different activities by the two categories of males. Nor could we detect differences between within-group and isolated males in the use of habitat types and canopy levels. At least three of five established mortality events involved males known to be isolated from groups. Given that males were found isolated only 11% of the time, it is estimated that isolated males were at least 12 times as likely to die as within-group males. These results suggest that dispersing males may not face increased risk of starvation, but are at higher risk of mortality (primarily through predation by eagles) than nondispersing males.

AB Individual fish of certain species show preferences for rejoining shoals of familiar individuals, suggesting that the development of familiarity within groups may be beneficial to group members. However, the relative value of shoaling with familiar individuals compared to, for example, joining a larger or more phenotypically matched group, is not known. We first confirmed, in separate experiments, that European minnows, Phoxinus phoxinus, prefer to join shoals of familiar individuals (with which they had been kept for 14 days) over unfamiliar ones, and show an increasing preference for the larger of two unfamiliar shoals presented in numerical size ratios of 1:1, 1:1.2, 1:1.9 and 1:4. In the latter experiment, test fish showed a marginal preference for the larger shoal at size ratio 1:1.2, and significant preferences in the 1:1.9 and 1:4 trials. To examine how test fish traded off familiarity against group size, we used the same shoal size ratios in a third experiment, this time with the smaller shoal being composed of individuals familiar to the test fish. In these trials, preferences for larger (nonfamiliar) and smaller (familiar) groups were balanced at the 1:1.9 shoal size ratio, and test fish significantly preferred the larger shoal only in the 1:4 trials. This suggests that the fish perceive the value of shoaling with familiars as equivalent to the benefits gained by doubling shoal size. Our results also indicate that preferences for familiar shoalmates are sufficient to offset defection to slightly larger groups. We discuss how this may stabilize group composition in natural habitats. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Selective breeding for differential aggression in mice provides evidence
   for heterochrony in social behaviours
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID GENETIC ANALYSIS; ONTOGENY
AB This research tested the hypothesis that selective breeding for differential aggression in mice produces heterochronic changes in social development, These changes were expected to take the form of a progressive neotenization of attack and freezing in the low line. Given that the effects of selective breeding were unidirectional, developmental trajectories were not expected to change among aggression animals. These hypotheses were tested using cross-sectional (generations S-1, S-4 and S-13) and longitudinal evaluations (S-4 and S-13) of attack and freezing behaviours in the two lines. The subjects were reared in isolation and observed in a dyadic test (10 min) at the ages of 28-30, 37, 42-45, 72 and 180-280 days. This design permitted us to (1) compare developmental rates in the two lines over generations, (2) determine whether the effects of experience on development changed during the course of selective breeding, and (3) assess whether information on heterochronic changes obtained in a cross-sectional evaluation were preserved when combined to a longitudinal one. Main effects of Line, generation, experience and their interactions an developmental functions were estimated using hierarchical linear modelling procedures. The neoteny hypothesis was supported for attack behaviours, both in cross-sectional studies and in combination with longitudinal investigations. Evidence for a paedomorphosis of the freezing response was also obtained in both studies. Replication was possible because experiential effects on development did not change over generations. This research demonstrated that heterochronic changes can be experimentally manipulated and mapped out systematically over generations. Our findings also suggested that heterochronic changes may have their origin in the plasticity of the epigenetic process. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated the behavioural mechanisms and adaptive significance of intraspecific brood parasitism in wood ducks, Air sponsa, by observing a colour-marked population in northeastern Illinois for seven breeding seasons (1989-15395). The birds nested in boxes that were dispersed widely and mounted high on tree trunks, mimicking the distribution and locations of natural nesting cavities. During 158 mornings of observation, 103 parasitic eggs were laid: 44 (43%) by females that had nested in the population previously and 59 (57%) by new recruits. Parasitism was a facultative behaviour, and its occurrence varied with a female's age and contents of the box in which she had previously nested. Returning females (2-7 years old) usually laid again in last year's box, even if another female already was laying there. Each female behaved as if the box were hers. Indeed, jointly nesting females behaved so similarly that it was impossible to differentiate the 'host' from the 'parasite'. Eventually one of these females was forced to depart, often after a fight. In 66% of cases the earlier-arriving female prevailed. Displaced females left behind eggs that were 'parasitic' in the definitional sense (i.e. incubated by another female), but parasitism actually was a consequence of being evicted from a favoured nestbox. Displaced females usually laid and incubated a complete clutch in a nearby box; the following year, they again attempted to nest in the box they had used initially. New recruits to the population were younger (1-2 years old), and they often did not nest. However, they did search widely for nesting cavities. When a new recruit found a suitable site that contained an active nest, she sometimes laid a few parasitic eggs there and, in subsequent seasons, attempted to nest in the box she had parasitized. Natal females often returned to and laid in the box from which they hatched, unless it was occupied by their mother. Adult females also actively avoided parasitizing close kin. In general, a nest cavity that was previously used successfully may be worth returning to, and fighting for, because its location is known and its quality has been proven. Scarcity of preferred nesting sites is probably the key ecological factor underlying all four unusual reproductive behaviours that characterize female wood ducks and other cavity-nesting waterfowl: natal philopatry, nest-site fidelity, aggressive competition for nest sites and high levels of intraspecific parasitism.

AB Food is the ecological factor assumed to drive the evolution of broodmate aggression and siblicide, but how does food actually influence agonism? Two hypotheses specify a proximate role of food in controlling aggression among avian broodmates. According to the food amount hypothesis, aggression increases with food deprivation; according to the prey size hypothesis, aggression increases when small food parcels are passed directly to chicks' mouths. The food amount hypothesis is confirmed by descriptive information and experiments on four ecologically and taxonomically diverse species (a sulid, a larid, an accipitrid and an alcid), but studies of ardeids supposedly contradict it. It is argued that the descriptive and experimental studies of ardeids are inconclusive, and actually contain evidence supporting the food amount hypothesis. Food-sensitive aggression may be universal in facultatively siblicidal species and appears to constitute an exception to the general rule that aggressiveness of birds and other vertebrates does not increase with food deprivation. There is no convincing evidence that the prey size hypothesis can explain variation among species or during development, and studies showing that heron chicks are more aggressive when prey are small are inconclusive because they did not exclude food deprivation as an alternative explanation. New formulations of the two hypotheses and new research directions are proposed. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Intracolony aggression in the eusocial naked mole-rat, <i>Heterocephalus

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL SUPPRESSION; COLONIES; REPRODUCTION
AB In colonies of the eusocial naked mole-rat, breeding is monopolized by one dominant female (the 'queen') and one to three males. Aggression in the form of shoving (prolonged pushes involving nose to nose contact) is frequently observed in captive colonies and is principally initiated by breeders. It has been suggested that shoving by queens functions primarily to suppress reproduction in subordinates (threat reduction hypothesis) or to incite work activity in nonbreeding 'helpers' (work conflict hypothesis). We tested predictions of both hypotheses by examining shoving in five captive colonies before and after removing breeders. Shoving was strongly associated with reproductive status. The vast majority of shoves were carried out by the queen, and to a lesser extent breeding males, and the onset of reproductive activity coincided with the onset, or greatly increased rates, of shoving. No evidence for the work conflict hypothesis was found. Queens shoved high-ranking and large colony members most, a finding that does not allow discrimination between hypotheses. Those males that posed the greatest threat to the queen's reproductive dominance, namely future breeding males, were shoved most, providing some support for the threat reduction hypothesis. However, evidence that queens targeted those females that posed the greatest threat, females that were to succeed them, was equivocal. Queen shoving may have several functions, depending on social context, in inhibiting reproduction in subordinates of both sexes, maintaining social order, and in inciting work-related behaviours in colony members, all of which ultimately increase the reproductive success of queens.

   SPECIATION; SUCCESS; PATTERNS; HYBRIDS; MALES; INHERITANCE
AB Behavioural isolation plays a critical role in several recent models of speciation. A detailed understanding of the process of speciation requires analysis of taxonomic groups that have not completed reproductive isolation. We studied D. silvestris and D. heteroneura because they are still in the process of divergence: behavioural isolation between them is incomplete, and neither postzygotic nor ecological isolation has been detected. Behavioural isolation is due to the failure of courtships between male D. silvestris and female D. heteroneura: there is no postzygotic isolation from either parental species. The Fl hybrids are as successful in courtship with parental individuals as same-species pairs, which suggests that the hybrids resemble male D. heteroneura or female D. silvestris in some behaviour patterns that are crucial to mating success. We searched for this crucial resemblance by examining courtship between F1 hybrids and the parental adults. We found that successful F1 males are somewhat more similar than unsuccessful F1 males to D. heteroneura males, but nevertheless they were intermediate between males of the two species. We also found that in both species the presence of female wings is necessary for courtship to proceed to copulation. These results reinforce an earlier report that behavioural isolation between these species is largely attributable to the decision as to whether to court at all, rather than to the details of courtship.

AB While there has been considerable interest in female choice for male sexual signals, there have been few studies of the underlying information that different aspects of the signal calls convey. Such studies, however, are essential to understand the significance of signals as honest handicaps, arbitrary Fisherian traits and/or in species recognition. We studied the somewhat exceptional system of audible drumming in the wolf spider Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata. We estimated the repeatabilities of signal components, the levels of between-male variance, the symmetry of the signal, the correlations between different aspects of drumming and their correlations with body weight. While in other taxa the frequency of audible signals may convey honest information of male size, in this species signal frequency was not related to male size and had a low repeatability. The pulse rate within each drum was highly repeatable but had a relatively small between-male coefficient of variation. In previous studies on this species, these traits were not important for male mating success. Among the traits directionally preferred by females, signal volume had considerable repeatability. Signal length was repeatable with high variability between males. In one population, signal length and volume were positively correlated with the rate at which males produced the drumming signals, a trait essential for male mating success. Thus, while signal length may reliably indicate male quality, other signal characteristics such as peak frequency and symmetry were not repeatable or were static and not related to any other male traits.

ID COTURNIX-JAPONICA; JAPANESE-QUAIL; CHOICE; SELECTION
AB We have shown previously that: (1) female Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, increase and male Japanese quail decrease their tendencies to affiliate with potential sex partners after seeing them mate, and (2) in both sexes of quail, affiliative preferences and choice of a sex partner are highly correlated. Here we predict that because effects of a prior male's sperm on a second male's probability of fertilizing a female are relatively brief, a male's avoidance of whichever member of a pair of females he has seen mating should be transitory. Conversely, because female quail seek high-quality males as mates and quality is a relatively permanent characteristic, females' preferences between males should remain constant over time. We found, as predicted, that the durations of effects on affiliation of seeing a-potential sex partner mate differed in male and female quail. Forty-eight hours after male quail saw a female mate, they no longer avoided her, whereas 48 h after female quail saw a male mate, his attractiveness remained enhanced. We conclude by suggesting that both the direction and the duration of responses of male and female Japanese quail to seeing a member of the other sex mating enhance the fitness of members of each sex.

AB Long-term field research has revealed that male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, affiliate and cooperate in several contexts. Assuming close genetic relationship among males, affiliative and cooperative behaviour have been hypothesized to evolve through the indirect effects of kin selection. We tested the hypothesis that matrilineal genetic relatedness affects patterns of male social affiliation and cooperation in an unusually large community of chimpanzees at the Ngogo study site, Kibale National:Park, Uganda. Field observations indicated that six behavioural measures of affiliation and cooperation among 23 adult males were significantly correlated with each other. Sequences of the first hypervariable portion of the mtDNA genome revealed that three pairs of males and one quintet shared mtDNA haplotypes. Matrix permutation tests using behavioural and genetic data showed that males that affiliated and cooperated with each other were not closely related through the maternal line. These findings add to a growing body of empirical evidence that suggest kinship plays an ancillary role in structuring patterns of wild chimpanzee behaviour within social groups.

AB The behaviour of herbivorous insects is influenced by their nutritional state. Nutrition-induced behavioural changes are often interpreted as adaptive mechanisms for controlling nutrient intake; however, their influence on other life history traits has received far less attention. We investigated the effect of food quality and distribution on the behaviour and phase state of desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria Forskal (Orthoptera, Acrididae), which change from the 'solitarious' to the 'gregarious' phase in response to population density. Phase change involves many morphological, physiological and behavioural changes. Solitarious insects are cryptic whereas gregarious locusts aggregate. Individual phase change is stimulated by mechanical contact with other locusts. A clumped resource distribution promotes change to the gregarious phase by increasing crowding and contact between individuals. In this study, we found that the effect of food distribution on locust phase depended on the nutritional quality of the food. We used three synthetic food treatments: near optimal, dilute and a choice of two unbalanced but complementary foods. Clumped resource distribution led to increased gregarization in the dilute and the complementary diet treatments. This effect was particularly pronounced on the complementary foods, owing to the interaction of crowding and locomotion. Gregarization was most pronounced in the dilute diet treatment, owing to increased activity. These diet-induced effects are explained in terms of behavioural changes in locomotion, quiescence and feeding that are consistent with what is known from earlier work on locust feeding behaviour and behavioural phase change.

AB In our study population, neighbouring song sparrows typically share two or more of their 6-10 song types. In an earlier experiment, we found that established neighbours typically reply to playback of neighbour-shared song with a different song they share with that neighbour ('repertoire matching'), rather than with the same song ('type matching') or with a nonshared song. In the present experiment, we considered the hypothesis that type matching is a threat or warning signal (Krebs et al. 1981, Animal Behaviour, 29, 918-923). We tested the specific prediction that a bird is more likely to type-match early in the breeding season when territory boundaries are new and still unstable, and more likely to repertoire-match later in the season,once those boundaries have became well established. Birds were played a shared song of a new neighbour once early (April) and again late (June) in the breeding season. As predicted, early in the season birds usually type-matched the playback (73% of the trials) but late in the season they type-matched only rarely (18%); birds never replied (early or late) with a nonshared song type.

TI Song learning with audiovisual compound stimuli in zebra finches
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID TAPED SONG; BEHAVIOR
AB We investigated the effects of audiovisual compound training on song learning in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. In the first experiment, presentation of a stuffed adult zebra finch male was found to be reinforcing to zebra finch males in an operant task. In a separate experiment, zebra finch males were reared without their father from day 7 after hatching onwards. Between 35 and 76 days, they were placed in isolation and exposed to taped songs of a zebra finch male, according to a random schedule (20 presentations/h). For half of the birds, presentation of the song coincided with presentation of a stuffed zebra finch male. For the remaining birds, each presentation of the song was followed by presentation of a stuffed male. The birds were subsequently isolated until day 142, when their own songs were recorded and analysed. Birds in both groups shared significantly more song elements with their tutor songs than with an unfamiliar song. There was no significant difference in song learning between the groups; These results confirm that zebra finches can learn part of their songs from taped tutor songs. Furthermore, simultaneous presentation of the tutor song and a relevant, salient visual stimulus is not superior to sequential presentation.

TI Asymmetry in spider orb webs: a result of physical constraints?
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID ARANEUS-DIADEMATUS; DESIGN; GEOMETRY; ORIENTATION; ARANEIDAE; BEHAVIOR
AB A typical feature of most vertical orb webs is that the upper web legion is smaller and contains less silk than the lower web region, creating an asymmetrical web. The degree of web asymmetry changes during the spider's development: small juveniles construct more symmetrical webs, but older and larger individuals decrease the upper web region. This implies that weight may control the extent of web asymmetry. Using two species, Argiope keyserlingi and Larinioides sclopetarius, we tested the effect of weight increase on web asymmetry by naturally increasing weight through feeding and by artificially adding lead weights to the abdomen of the spiders. Weight increase (natural or artificial) resulted in more asymmetric webs through a reduction of the upper web region. Added weight may interfere with spiral placement in the upper region, because the spider has to lift its abdomen above the carapace during the process. In the lower region, however, the position of the spider is mostly head up during spiral placement. Therefore, amongst other factors, weight and gravitational forces may be physical constraints during web construction. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID GREAT SPOTTED CUCKOOS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; MAGPIE HOST; COEVOLUTION;
   DEFENSES
AB We present a dynamic model of the evolution of host resistance to avian brood parasites, when the latter can retaliate against hosts that reject parasitic eggs. In a verbal model, Zahavi (1979, American Naturalist, 113, 157-159) suggested that retaliatory cuckoos might prevent the evolution of host resistance by reducing the reproductive success of rejecter hosts (i.e. by destroying their eggs or nestlings). Here we develop a model based on the association between the great spotted cuckoo, Clamator glandarius, and its main host, the European magpie, Pica pica, because this is the only system that has provided supportive evidence, to date, for the existence of retaliatory behaviour. Our aims were (1) to derive the conditions for invasion of the retaliation strategy in a nonretaliatory parasite population and (2) to investigate the consequences of retaliation for the evolution of host defence. If we assume a cost of discrimination for rejecter hosts in the absence of parasitism, and a cost paid by a retaliator for monitoring nests, our model shows cyclical dynamics. There is no evolutionarily stable strategy, and populations of both hosts and parasites will cycle indefinitely, the period of the cycles depending on mutation and/or migration rate. A stable polymorphism of accepters and rejecters occurs only when parasites are nonretaliators. The spread of retaliator parasites drives rejecter hosts to extinction.

AB Behavioural estimates of male mating success in polygynous grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, may be misleading as females are known to be promiscuous. At Sable island, Nova Scotia, we collected behavioural observations and skin samples for paternity analysis from 56 females and their attending males. Twenty-four of these females were found in the following year and their offspring were sampled. Using seven hypervariable microsatellite loci, we excluded the consort male as the father in 43% of the cases. The probability of exclusion of these seven loci was 98.2%. Contrary to expectations, inland females had higher rates of extraconsort fertilizations (ECFs) (70%) than beach females (23%). Younger females (<9 years) had slightly more ECFs than older females, but this was not significant. The duration of male consortship did not differ between females with ECFs and females fertilized by their consort male. Two explanations may account for the inland females having more ECFs: a higher ratio of females to tenured males inland may provide a greater opportunity for nonconsort males to obtain copulations; and inland females travel greater distances to depart for the ocean and may attract more males. These results are more consistent with the hypothesis that ECFs are a by-product for females of male strategies to maximize reproductive success than with hypotheses concerned with either material or genetic benefits gained by females.

   BIRDS; PREDICTABILITY
AB Many birds and mammals respond to a heightened risk of predation, especially that associated with smaller group sizes, with an increase in vigilance. All interpretations of the way in which vigilance responds to changes in predation risk assume that animals feeding with their heads down (i.e. animals in a nonvigilant state) cannot detect approaching predators. We provide the first explicit test of this assumption by 'flying' a mounted hawk down a 15-m chute towards actively feeding, free-living, dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis. Juncos were targeted individually for simulated attack when they had either a 'head-down' view up the chute, or a completely unobstructed view; a junco with a head-down view could see up the chute only when it lowered its head to feed. Juncos with an unobstructed view almost always detected the hawk;at the maximum distance of 15 m. Juncos with a head-down view usually detected the attack at a distance of 10-15 m against a grey background, but detection distances were shorter when attacks occurred against a camouflaged background. The results demonstrate that these birds have a considerable ability to detect approaching predators even when not overtly vigilant, although their detection ability is greater when they raise their heads. Vigilance sequences, therefore, probably consist of bouts of low-quality detection (active feeding) interspersed with bouts of higher-quality detection (overt vigilance) that can only be accomplished at the expense of feeding. This realization has major implications for current interpretations of the vigilance group size effect and antipredator vigilance in general.

ID OPHIOPHAGE DEFENSIVE RESPONSE; GARTER SNAKES; OLFACTORY SYSTEMS
AB Most reptiles and mammals, with the exceptions of crocodilians, aquatic mammals and some primates, have a functional vomeronasal organ that detects and perceives semi-volatile chemicals in the environment. This organ is used in detection of prey and is also important for recognition of conspecifics and potential predators. We tested eight species of North American pit vipers for behavioural responses to an ophiophagous (snake-eating) predator, the common kingsnake, Lampropeltis getula. Kingsnakes have a substance in their skin that is recognized by crotalines, which react with a series of defensive responses including, but not limited to, avoidance, fleeing, body bridging and head hiding. The vomeronasal duct of the pit vipers was sutured closed to determine the role of this organ in detection of kingsnakes. Pit vipers with intact and sutured vomeronasal ducts were tested In a neutral cage-with a kingsnake and monitored for behavioural responses. Results demonstrated that the vomeronasal organ is important in the recognition of kingsnakes by pit vipers and raises doubts that any other Sense plays a major role in this behaviour.

AB We investigated whether song types function as fundamental units of song variation in song sparrows, Melospiza melodia. As the size of a male song sparrow's repertoire increases, so doe the mean similarity of his song types, as measured by the sharing of minimal units of production (MUPs). It follows that if MUP similarity is important perceptually, then small repertoires (of dissimilar song types) may be functionally equivalent to large repertoires (of similar song types). We performed two experiments to test whether MUP similarity is important perceptually to male song sparrows. Both experiments used a habituation/recovery design, in which recovery in response at a switch in stimuli is used to gauge the subject's perception of the similarity of the stimuli. The results of both experiments indicate that the level of perceived similarity between pairs of songs does not depend on their level of MUP similarity, within the range of MUP similarities found between song types. Songs with high enough MUP similarity to be judged as variants of the same song type are, however, perceived to be much more similar than are any two song types. The results are compatible with a categorical model. of song type perception. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

DT Article
ID BREEDING SUCCESS; SELECTION; PREDATION; BEHAVIOR
AB sandwich terns, Sterna sandvicensis, often nest in association with black-headed gulls, Larus ridibundus. The gulls provide protection against predators, but can also adversely affect the terns' reproductive success through predation and piracy of fish. To test whether leading the chicks away from the nest site is an evasive strategy used by the parent's to reduce the incidence of robbery by the gulls, we kept one group of Sandwich tern chicks at their original breeding site, while, with a wire-netting enclosure, we moved another group away from the gulls. The rate of kleptoparasitism was greatly reduced when the tern chicks were moved away from the original nest site, resulting in faster growth and earlier fledging. The rate of food parasitism and chick condition were affected only during the first 5 days of the experiment. After that, the rate of kleptoparasitism no longer differed between chicks that we moved away and those remaining in the colony. A second shift of the chicks again led to less kleptoparasitism and better chick condition. In line with these findings, the condition of free-living chicks that were lured away from their nesting site by their parents also improved. In particular, chicks initially in poor condition, which apparently suffered from high rates of kleptoparasitism, left the colony site. Free-living chicks are often lured away from the robbing gulls. However, not all subcolonies provided suitable escape routes and subsequently chicks in such subcolonies suffered from high mortality rates.

AB The functions;and mechanisms of chemical communication are well established for many species of small mammal amenable to investigation, but systematic research is virtually absent for large, rare species. The present study marks the first systematic investigation of chemical communication in the endangered giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca. Using a habituation-discrimination paradigm, we sought to determine whether giant pandas can discriminate between scents from different individuals on the basis of chemical cues afforded by female urine and male anogenital gland secretions. Pandas habituated to successive presentations of scent stimuli from a single individual, as evidenced by diminished responsiveness across five habituation trials. In the discrimination test for male anogenital gland secretions, subjects of both sexes investigated a new individual's scent significantly more than a familiar scent to which they were previously habituated. Neither sex significantly discriminated novel from habituated female urine, although a strong tendency to differentiate the stimuli was evident. We also found that the sex of the subject affected patterns of response. Females,showed a significant preference for male anogenital gland secretions, whereas males investigated both types of scent stimuli equally. In general, male subjects were more responsive than females to conspecific scent, especially female urine. This study provides clear evidence that giant pandas distinguish individual;odours emanating from male anogenital secretions, and implies that these odours contain individually distinctive chemical signatures. These results have implications that can be applied to the conservation and management of this species. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Variation in timing and distance of dispersal movements of juvenile birds may result from differences in competitive ability. Dispersal by low-ranking juveniles may be initiated before dominants if the latter force subordinate siblings from natal areas. Conversely, when vacant territories are limited and are acquired on a first-come first-served basis, selection could operate on young to disperse as early as possible. In this case, dominant individuals with priority of access to resources in the natal area will mature more quickly and are expected to disperse first. If costs of dispersal increase with dispersal distance, dominant juveniles are expected to disperse shorter distances. Alternately, if there: are advantages to long-distance dispersal, then dominants, which are in better condition, should disperse further than subordinates. We examined effects of social rank on the timing and distance (to wintering area) of dispersal movements by juvenile western screech-owls, Otus kennicottii, in Southwestern Idaho. Based on observations of aggressive interactions made using video cameras attached to nestboxes, we assigned dominance ranks to nestlings within nine broods. We radiotracked young throughout the postfledging period to determine order of dispersal, and we located them after leaving their natal areas to determine distances to apparent overwintering areas. In six of seven broods, for which dispersal information could be recorded, the most dominant juvenile dispersed first. Moreover, in five of seven broods, the least dominant individual was the last individual to disperse, and the order of dispersal matched the dominance hierarchy in four of seven broods. In contrast, social status did not affect postfledging dispersal distance.

AB We investigated the mechanisms and functions of shoal choice in relation to nutritional state in the zebrafish. Single fish that had been well fed or food deprived for 2 days were presented with a choice between two stimulus shoals. Food-deprived test fish showed a significant preference for well-fed stimulus fish over food-deprived ones whereas well-fed test fish did not exhibit any significant preference. Subsequent experiments showed that food-deprived test fish had a significantly higher foraging success in shoals consisting of well-fed individuals than in ones that comprised food-deprived fish. No difference in the locomotory behaviour of food-deprived and well-fed stimulus fish was found with respect to the proportion of time spent swimming (as opposed to being motionless), the proportion of time spent in the upper part of the test tank and the number of sharp turns. However, body weight, stomach width (measured directly behind the pectoral girdle) and ventro-dorsal height significantly decreased over a 48-h fooh-deprivation period. The potential use of the latter factors for the recognition; of food-deprived individuals is discussed. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Helping behaviour in facultatively eusocial hover wasps: an experimental
   test of the subfertility hypothesis
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID CASTE
AB A candidate explanation for the evolution of eusociality is that helpers are physiologically constrained such that helping is their only realistic option. We tested this subfertility hypothesis in a species of facultatively eusocial hover wasp (Hymenoptera, Stenogastrinae: Liostenogaster flavolineata) by seeing whether helpers that were forced to nest on their own were able to mature their own eggs. One focal helper was left alone on each of 22 nests, from which all other adult wasps (including the dominant) were permanently removed. After 18 days, all but one of the 19 focal helpers that remained on their nests had ovarian development and insemination status characteristic of dominants, and the majority had probably laid eggs. This was in striking contrast to the reproductive status of other helpers removed from the same nests at the start of the experiment. These results provide convincing experimental evidence that females do not become helpers because of some unconditional physiological constraint. There is currently no unequivocal support for the subfertility hypothesis in facultatively eusocial Hymenoptera lacking morphological castes.

AB Should a female copy the mate choice of other females? A female may rank a mated male higher in quality than an unmated male because the former has demonstrated that he is able to attract a female. However, a prospecting female may also avoid a mated male because of the risk that she has to compete with the male's initial mate over access to copulations, breeding resources and male parental care. We studied the mate choice of female pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, in aviaries divided into three compartments, two for males, and one for a female. A female was allowed to choose (build a nest in a nestbox) between two males after a period when she had been kept in a rage behind a one-way mirror and had presumably seen that one of the males was in the company of another female for 5 h. There was no evidence that females copied the mate choice of conspecific females, or that they avoided males that had recently been in the company of another female. Instead, females apparently chose a mate independently of others, choosing the male showing most courtship display. The latter result explains the consistency in mate choice observed when different females chose between the same pair of males in repeat trials. The ability of females to pick out the same male independently may also explain why a few males obtain most copulations in lekking species. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   COMPETITION; FITNESS; MODELS
AB The parasitoid wasp genus Achrysocharoides (Eulophidae) is unusual in that many of its species lay male and female eggs in single-sex clutches. The average clutch size of female broods is always greater than that of male broods, and in some species male clutch size is always one. We constructed models that predicted that severely egg-limited wasps should produce equal numbers of male and female eggs while severely host-limited wasps should produce equal numbers of male and female broods (and hence an overall female-biased sex ratio). Theory is developed to predict clutch size and sex ratio across the complete spectrum of host and egg limitation. A comparison of 19 surveys of clutch composition in seven species of Achrysocharoides showed a general pattern of equal numbers of male and female broods with a female-biased sex ratio (suggesting host limitation) although with considerable heterogeneity amongst collections and with a number of cases of unexpectedly low frequencies of male broods. Using a previous estimate of the relationship between fitness and size in the field, we predicted the maximally productive (Lack) clutch size for female broods of Achrysocharoides zwoelferi to be three. Of clutches observed in nature, 95% were equal to or smaller in size than the predicted Lack clutch size. When we manipulated local host density in the field, and as predicted by our models, clutch size and the proportion of female broods of A. zwoelferi decreased as hosts became more common, but the absolute frequency of male clutches was lower than expected.

AB Animals should increase their present reproductive output if their chances for future reproduction are low. However, an animal's ability to make this adjustment may be constrained by the physiological mechanisms mediating the response. To examine this hypothesis, I infected 2- and 5-week-old female crickets, Acheta domesticus, with either a pathogen (the bacterium Serratia marcescens) that induces antimicrobial immune responses, or a parasite (larvae of the parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea) that induces an encapsulation immune response. Females of both age groups infected with bacteria laid more eggs the day after injection than did saline-injected crickets. A similar increase was elicited by injecting components of the bacterial cell wall (lipopolysaccharides). The bacteria-induced increase in egg laying (1) was not the result of physical stress, (2) did not appear to be a nonspecific response to the infection, and (3) was probably not mediated by octopamine. Females did not increase egg laying when infested with O. ochracea, even though this parasitoid invariably kills its host. Injections of Sephadex beads, which induced an immune response similar to that created by the parasitoids, also had no effect on egg laying. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that crickets can increase egg laying in response to infection and that increased egg output correlates with the activation of some, but not all, immune responses.

DT Article

AB Faeces may be ideal substances for scent marking because they have a minimal energetic cost to the signaller. However, marking with faeces is also constrained by the animal's ability to produce faeces. This study examined whether limits on the volume of faeces produced by oribi, Ourebia ourebi, in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, caused territorial males to regulate their output and prioritize the placement of faecal marks. Territorial males marked with faeces more often, and with a smaller volume per defecation, than did juvenile males and females. Territorial males also defecated only on established dung middens along borders shared with other territorial males or on top of a female's urine and faeces. In contrast, juvenile males and females defecated randomly with regard to their location in territories. Territorial males with larger harems marked with faeces at higher rates and less volume than males with few or no females. This difference suggests that when males overmark female excretions they reduce the amount of faeces available for marking other preferred sites, such as along territory borders shared with other males. Dominant males with adult subordinates marked with faeces less often, and with a greater volume per mark, than males that defended territories without the aid of subordinates. Dominant males also reduced the volume of marks less as the number of females on their territory increased than did males without subordinates. Territories occupied by more than one adult male also were marked with faeces at higher rates, and with marks of greater volume, than territories held by single males. These results suggest that the presence of subordinate males reduced the demand on dominant males to, regulate the volume and placement of faecal marks. Overall, these results suggest that territorial male oribi;regulate their faecal marking behaviour in response to a limited supply of faeces.

TI Interruptions to foraging and learning in a changing environment
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION; PREDATION; RISK
AB Many resources are both stochastic and variable in their average profitability. Animals have to sample them to track their current states, but whether it is economic to attempt this depends on many factors. Furthermore, there are many interruptions and distractions from foraging (e.g. escape from predators, bad weather, displacement by competitors) which interfere with the acquisition of information. We present a dynamic model of foraging in a stochastic and varying environment, under the constant threat of interruption, to investigate this very general problem. A forager faces two foraging options, one of which provides a known and constant reward, the other providing a reward that is not only stochastic, but whose mean payoff varies in time. The forager has to learn which option has the highest current payoff by sampling. However, interruptions to foraging can occur at any time, the timing and duration of which are beyond the animal's control. When there is a small probability of foraging being interrupted, the forager should forage extensively on the unknown option, but as the probability of interruptions is increased, there is a sudden transition to foraging only on the known option. This occurs because interruptions affect both the level of information required to make exploitation of the unknown option profitable, and the ability to acquire and maintain that information. At what probability of being interrupted this threshold emerges is affected by the value of learning about the unknown option and the duration of interruptions. We discuss the generality of our results with reference to the pervasive problem of updating information in the face of different types of interruption.

AB Parasitized animals are often reported to have a reduced competitive ability in experimental studies designed to examine foraging success under a specific type of competitive interaction; however, since animals compete under a range of competition regimes in natural situations, and because success is likely to require different foraging skills under each, it is unclear whether infected animals should be equally poor competitors under all competitive scenarios. We studied the foraging success of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, infected with plerocercoids of a cestode, Schistocephalus solidus, in competition with uninfected conspecifics. When pairs of differentially infected sticklebacks were presented with sequentially introduced items, the numbers of available prey taken by infected and uninfected competitors did not differ significantly, although nonparasitized fish were more successful at taking items over which there was direct competition. In contrast, when prey items were presented simultaneously in a locally dense patch, nonparasitized fish ingested significantly more of the available food than their infected counterparts: an apparent consequence of their greater ability to take items in rapid succession. Our results show that the type of competition conditions generated as a result of specific prey distribution patterns plays a role in determining the relative foraging success of parasitized sticklebacks, and suggest that this may have consequences for the distribution of different infection classes in natural, heterogeneous environments.

AB The mating system of the seaweed fly involves a premating struggle. When mounted, females violently try to remove the male. In this study 48% of premating struggles resulted in successful rejection of the male, 46% in copulation and 6% were terminated by the male. Large males had a mating advantage. However, contrary to what;would be predicted if this sexual selection occurred as a result of active female mate choice, we found a positive association between the duration of premating struggles and male size. A positive association was also found between the duration of premating struggles and male mating success, suggesting that large males may benefit through their superior ability to withstand female rejection. Large females rejected males more easily than small females, suggesting that the premating struggle has not evolved to allow mate assessment by females. We conclude that sexual selection is occurring as a side-effect of the female rejection response, which has probably evolved in order to avoid costs associated with copulation. Nevertheless, a sexual size dimorphism has evolved with males being larger and much more variable in size than females. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In the Kruger National Park, male lions, Panthera lee, acquire most of their food by hunting rather than scavenging. This study, the most intensive to date of male lion ecology, showed that in savanna woodlands, with high buffalo, Syncerus caffer, densities, male lions were frequent and successful hunters. The main prey species of all male group types, but particularly nonterritorial males, was buffalo: By contrast, females preyed more frequently on the most abundant medium-sized ungulates, such as wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, and zebra, Equus burchelli. Thus intraspecific prey selection separation was based primarily on intersexual and, to a lesser extent, social differences. Furthermore, both nonterritorial males and pride females located their favoured prey, buffalo and medium-sized ungulates, respectively, more often than other prey. We investigated the influence of several ecological variables on the socioecology of male lions, particularly as we had determined that territorial males spent little time with their pride females and tended to hunt by themselves in their respective male coalitions. Further analysis showed that in a range of ecosystems in southern and eastern Africa the proportion of time territorial males spent with, and thus scavenged from, their pride females was strongly influenced by vegetation structure, and therefore probably by the assemblage of available ungulates. In open systems, territorial males were, therefore, likely to be encountered with pride females, whereas in more wooded areas they were likely to be encountered away from their pride females. We suggest that this is because vegetation structure influences food/prey availability and hunting success and influences territory maintenance and/or cub defence.

AB Under specific circumstances, nonhuman primate females may experience orgasm. The occurrence of female copulatory orgasm appears to be highly variable, however, and its proximate causation is poorly understood. We investigated the proximate mechanisms that control orgasmic response in female macaques. During 238 h of observation of sexual behaviour in a large captive group of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, 240 copulations Were recorded involving 68 different heterosexual pairs formed by 16 males and 26 females. Female orgasmic responses were observed in 80 of 240 copulations (33%). The frequency of orgasms was not correlated with female age or dominance rank, but it was higher for copulations lasting longer and involving a higher number of mounts and pelvic thrusts. When the level of physical stimulation experienced by females during copulation was statistically controlled, the highest frequency of female orgasms was found among pairs formed by high-ranking males and low-ranking females and the lowest frequency among pairs formed by low-ranking males and high-ranking females. These findings suggest that the proximate mechanisms that control orgasmic threshold in female macaques are more responsive to social stimuli and less constrained by physiological limitations than previously thought.

AB Caribbean spiny lobsters, Panulirus argru, reside solitarily during the first months postsettlement, but shift to gregarious shelter use in later juvenile stages, at sizes as small as 15 mm in carapace length. To determine whether receptivity to or production of a chemical attractant among spiny lobster conspecifics is dependent upon body size or spatial scale, we conducted a series of overnight Y-maze shelter choice experiments. We placed a test lobster in an experimental arena and allowed it to choose between two shelters, which differed only in that water flowing by one shelter contained sea water that had passed through a header tank containing a conspecific. We varied the size of the lobster in the arena, the size and number of lobsters in the header tank, and the size of the experimental arena. Lobsters of all sizes tested released odours that attracted conspecifics; however, a single small lobster could attract other conspecifics only in the small arena. Lobsters greater than 15 mm in carapace length were attracted to shelters from which conspecific odours were emanating, while smaller lobsters were not. The results of this study suggest that: (1) the earliest benthic stages (less than 15 mm in carapace length) are unresponsive to conspecific odours, but lobsters greater than 15 mm in carapace length are attracted by conspecific odours; and (2) large lobsters produce a sufficient quantity of scent to attract conspecifics over distances of at least a few metres, whereas small lobsters (15-30 mm in carapace length) cannot. Body size- and spatial scale-dependent attraction could contribute to the shift from solitary to gregarious shelter use among Caribbean spiny lobsters.

TI Lateralized agonistic responses and hindlimb use in toads
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID FROG
AB The recent discovery of forepaw preferences (handedness) in toad species has provided some insight into the evolution of brain lateralization. We tested the prediction that, as in higher vertebrates, visual lateralization and other motor preferences (footedness) also exists in toad species. During feeding periods, South American cane toads, Bufo marinus, showed a population bias to strike with the tongue at other toads occupying their left visual field. This is the first demonstration of lateralized visual behaviour in an amphibian species. Tongue striking at an individual's eyes or head may sometimes delay its approach to prey already seen by the attacker, or may dislodge prey from its mouth. In addition, we report hindlimb preferences (footedness) for contact righting in three species of toad (B. marinus, the European green toad, B. viridis, and the European common toad, B. bufo). After being fully overturned on to their back on a horizontal surface, toads initiated and completed righting using the hindlimbs and with only perfunctory use of the forepaws. Together, the findings of visual lateralization and footedness demonstrate that in toads, as in higher vertebrates, behavioural lateralization is not restricted to handedness. The hypothesis that lateralized brain functions in birds and mammals might have arisen from a common lateralized ancestor is therefore supported.

AB I investigated the occurrence, frequency and distribution of allosuckling in a wild population of fallow deer, Dama dama, throughout the lactation period during 1992 in southern Sweden. A total of 292 suckling bouts were observed in four groups; in 43% of these, fawns were seen sucking from a female that was not the mother. Allosuckling occurred in;a higher percentage of suckling bouts as the lactation period progressed and all 16 fawns participated to various degrees. Of the 16 females, 13 suckled nonoffspring fawns but their behaviour towards these fawns varied greatly. Allosuckling was positively correlated with the age of the females and negatively correlated with the rate of their aggressive behaviour. Since allosuckling was not performed between groups but was common between related members in a stable social unit and was expressed reciprocally between the oldest individuals in the group, allosuckling could be a result of kin selection and/or reciprocal altruism.

AB The evolution of leks (aggregations of males displaying to females) cannot be explained solely by an increasing average gain in matings for each male as group size increases. This is because the mating skew, that is, the inequality among males in mating success, is often high and may vary with lek size. Here, we show that the common observation that matings become more evenly divided as lek size increases is also insufficient to explain by itself the benefits of aggregating. The benefits to individual males are highly sensitive to the exact relationship between mating skew and lek size, and very similar relationships can lead to opposite predictions concerning individual benefits. With data on published mating success for 18 species (71 leks), we show that different species have very similar skew versus lek size relationships. With current sample sizes, however,there is insufficient statistical power to distinguish between completely different alternatives concerning individual optima of males.

AB Positive correlations between male vocalization and reproductive success have been documented for many animal species. They are usually based on differences between males in vocalization rate, duration or repertoire size. Here, we present probably the first field study linking differences in territorial overlap and mating status to differences in a single, clearly definable song element, the 'Snarr'. Male water pipits, Anthus spinoletta, with high Snarr scores were mated more often than males with low scores, and their territories overlapped less with those of neighbours. Although correlating positively with male body condition, the frequency of the Snarr did not reflect male age, territory size, territory quality in terms of food and paternal performance. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the higher mating success of males with high Snarr scores results from active female choice of high-quality males; rather, high Snarr scores seem to signal dominance in malts. Likely mechanisms that produce the link between vocalization and mating success, and potential costs that prevent some males from producing the Snarr at a higher rate, are discussed.

ID LIZARD LACERTA-VIVIPARA; CHEMICAL CUES; RESPONSES; SELECTION
AB We investigated (1) the importance of chemical cues for predator detection by the nocturnal, rock-dwelling velvet gecko, Oedura lesueurii, and (2) how the lizards' responses to snake odour may have exerted selection on the foraging behaviours of a nocturnal elapid snake. This snake species (broadheaded snake, Hoplocephalus bungaroides) feeds primarily on velvet geckos, and does so by means of a distinctive foraging behaviour: the snakes remain sedentary in rock crevices for days or weeks, waiting to ambush geckos. Behavioural assays showed that geckos that are sympatric with this sedentary 'ambush' predator can detect and respond to the scent of the snake. Retreat-site selection experiments showed that geckos are less likely to enter crevices if the snake's scent is distributed over the entire rock surface, rather than localized to a central portion. Together, these data support the notion that the 'ambush' predator benefits by remaining sedentary within a retreat-site for long periods, because it thereby minimizes the extent to which it spreads its scent over the rocks forming the crevice. Geckos from a population sympatric with the 'ambush' predator responded strongly to the snake scent, bur those from an allopatric population did not. Additionally, geckos from sympatric populations were able to detect the scent of a nocturnal snake that does not eat geckos (small-eyed snake, Rhinoplocephalus nigrescens), but did not modify their retreat-site selection or locomotory behaviours in response to this cue. Lizards from allopatric populations apparently did not detect the scent of small-eyed snakes. Collectively, our findings support an interpretation of predator-prey coevolution in the present system, and emphasize the importance of chemosensory cues to these rock-dwelling reptiles.

AB I compared reproductive success (lifetime number of fertilized eggs) as a function of mate choice among females of the stink bug, Nezara viridula L. (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). 'Choosing' (C) females were placed with one of two males on alternate days. CI females chose between inexperienced males while CR females chose between males previously rejected by CI females. 'Non-choosing' (N) females were placed with the same male every day. Non-choosing NI, NR and NA females encountered, respectively, inexperienced males, previously rejected males, or previously accepted and mated males. Reproductive success was highest for CI females, showing direct selection on mate preferences. Reproductive success did not differ between CR and NR females, indicating that male quality, not the act of choosing a mate, affects fitness. CI females preferred males with longer antennae and their fecundity (lifetime number of eggs) was correlated with male antenna length, consistent with antenna length as an indicator of male ability to transfer nutritive sperm produced in paired harlequin lobes of the testes. Harlequin lobes were smaller in rejected than chosen males. In second-generation mate choice trials, sons of NR females competed well against sons of NA females but not against sons of CI females. This suggests that non-genetic paternal contributions that decline with prior mating account for the attractiveness of sons because sons of CI and NA females shared the same fathers. Sons experiencing mating success came from larger eggs and egg size was greatest for CI females, perhaps as a consequence of paternal nutritional contributions.

AB It has been suggested that male birds adjust their territory size in order to prevent potential intruders from gaining extra-pair copulations. The risk of cuckoldry is supposed to be highest when the distance between a female and the neighbouring males is shortest. This paper describes the variation in territory size of the chiffchaff, Phylloscopus collybita, in relation to the breeding cycle. Contrary to the risk of cuckoldry hypothesis, chiffchaff territories were larger prior to the fertile period of the females and at a minimal size during the fertile period. A review of the literature shows little, if any, evidence of a peak in territory size during the fertile period of the females for most species studied. It is suggested that territoriality is in need of an operational definition. Without such a definition, it is difficult to make and test predictions about the adaptive basis of variation in territory size. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Recent theoretical models suggest that males may respond to changes in paternity by adjusting their parental effort. Male response will depend on the availability of reliable paternity cues and the relative costs and benefits of parental effort to the male (i.e. its effect on the survival of young and alternative mating opportunities). Males breeding in pairs may be constrained because reductions in male parental effort are unlikely to be compensated for by the female and thus the survival of both related and unrelated young may decrease, In contrast, males breeding in cooperative groups (i.e. with helpers or co-breeders) may not have this constraint if other individuals in the group compensate for reductions in male parental effort. White-browed scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis, breed in pairs and cooperative groups, typically with one female and two males (alpha and beta), We found that male parental effort was related positively to paternity for beta males, but not for alpha or pair males. Alpha males had paternity in all broods and always fed young. In contrast, beta males often had no paternity and sometimes did not feed young. Time spent near the fertile female was not an accurate predictor of the percentage of young sired in a brood, but it was a good predictor of having sired young in a brood. Our results are consistent with the idea that male parental effort is allocated according to whether or not the male copulated with the female. We suggest that the relationship between male parental effort and paternity may vary among cooperatively breeding species depending on the type and availability of cues to a male's paternity.

AB Current hypotheses for explaining which sex cares for offspring assume a relationship between the mode of fertilization and the sex showing parental care. In general, it is hypothesized that maternal care should be concentrated in taxa with internal fertilization, and paternal care should be concentrated in taxa with external fertilization. Studies have supported this relationship; however, new comparative techniques and new data on parental care and the frequency of internal fertilization in anurans suggest that the relationship should be re-evaluated. I examined the relationship between mode of fertilization and sex providing parental care in 334 taxa of anurans using concentrated changes tests and in 396 taxa of anurans using a method developed by Ridley (1983. The Explanation of Organic Diversity. The Comparative Method and Adaptations of Mating. Oxford: Clarendon). The results of the concentrated changes tests showed that both female and male parental care are randomly distributed among taxa with respect to mode of fertilization. However, using Ridley's method, I found significant relationships between mode of fertilization and sex providing parental care. The observed and expected numbers of transitions from external fertilization and no parental care to external fertilization and male parental care or to internal fertilization and female parental care are not qualitatively different. Therefore, the results of my analyses suggest that current hypotheses for explaining the occurrence of maternal versus paternal care in anurans should be reconsidered.

AB Division of labour among workers in insect societies often includes two major components: age-related changes in behaviour (age polyethism) and specialization in task performance. The aim of this study was to test whether similarity in inside-nest task performance and in rate of age polyethism correspond to genetic similarity among nestmates in the polygynous eusocial wasp Polybia aequatorialis. Behavioural data were collected on marked, known-age workers from three source colonies introduced into two observation colonies in the held. Genetic similarity among workers was assessed by quantifying sharing of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker alleles. Workers were categorized by whether they engaged in nest cleaning as an indicator of individual differences in inside-nest task performance. Within source colonies, workers that performed nest-cleaning tasks were more genetically similar to each other than they were to workers not performing these tasks. Workers also differed in their rates of passage through the age-related task sequence, but no association was found between sharing of RAPD marker alleles and rate of age polyethism. These results accord with earlier studies demonstrating flexibility in age polyethism in swarm-founding wasps, and with findings that worker genotypic variability corresponds to specialization in task performance in P. aequatorialis. Polybia spp. workers rarely switch among tasks, even in response to changes in colony conditions, and workers' genotypes may constrain flexibility in task performance at the individual level. Conversely, colonies may accrue benefits from having genotypically diverse worker forces, which could favour the maintenance of polygyny in swarm-founding wasps.

AB Burying beetles (genus Nicrophorus) provide elaborate parental care to their offspring. Parental beetles defend a small vertebrate carcass, which constitutes the sole food source for the larvae. They also manipulate the carcass in various ways and directly regurgitate pre-digested carrion to the young. The benefits of carcass manipulation and regurgitation have been the subject of a few small-scale studies that have yielded conflicting results. In this study, we investigated the benefits of these behaviours and tested for possible beneficial effects on larval survival rates and final body mass in N. vespilloides. In this species: (1) larval survival and mass were significantly higher in broods receiving parental care throughout larval development on the carcass than in broods developing in the absence of adults; (2) parental presence immediately subsequent to larval hatching greatly improved larval survival rates (3) continued parental presence for several days further improved larval growth, leading to a greater final mass of individual larvae; (4) larval survival and growth were improved by parental preparation of carcasses and by an excision made in the integument of the carcass surface by the parents that allows the larvae ready access to their food; (5) positive effects of parental feeding on larval survival and growth were not mediated by the transfer of symbionts.

AB When animals defend territories that are large and structurally complex, scent marks alone are unlikely to be reliable signals of a resident's dominance and competitors should require initial proof through direct interaction. This was tested using freshly captured Mus spretus which occupy large non-overlapping ranges in grassland but are strongly attracted to substrate odours from unfamiliar competitors. Choice tests measured time spent investigating and chewing to gain access to paired nestboxes when the entrances were blocked with mesh. Experiment I established that mice of both sexes were more strongly attracted to their own odour than to a clean site. Experiment 2 examined choice between the subject's own odour and that of an unfamiliar same-sex competitor both before and after meeting the competitor in a neutral (clean) arena. Prior to interaction, males exerted much effort to gain access to both their own and their unfamiliar competitor's odour. Once relative dominance had been established through agonistic interaction, subordinates avoided their dominant competitor's odour in favour of their own while dominants continued to be attracted to both. There was little aggressive competition between unfamiliar females and relative status did not affect their attraction to a competitor's odour. Females tended to be more attracted to a competitor's odour than to their own prior to interaction but showed less attraction to a. competitor's odour post-interaction. A third experiment showed that the odour of an unfamiliar male was more attractive than that from an unfamiliar female, especially to males. The consequences of these responses for maintaining spatial dispersion in this species are discussed. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Field experiments on squirrel spatial memory under naturalistic conditions showed that grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, are capable of relocating precise spatial goals using short range visual cues. These goals were in the form of buried food, similar to natural cache sites, and were relocated to within 5 cm in 62.5% of all attempts after a retention interval of 20 days. Some recall could be demonstrated after more protracted retention intervals (43 and 62 days). These results suggest that grey squirrels' spatial memory is accurate enough to support a successful retrieval strategy. Application of one of the same methods to a population of red squirrels, Sciurus vulgoris, which is not as reliant on stored food, suggested that their spatial memory is less long lasting as predicted by the adaptive specialization hypothesis of cognitive function.

AB Animals sometimes forage for resources whose benefits are not energy-based. In such cases, the benefits and costs of foraging cannot be directly compared, making it difficult to evaluate the currency of fitness maximized by the animal's behaviour. For bees, pollen represents such a resource, because they collect pollen as the sole protein source for developing larvae, rather than as a source of energy. This study compared three currencies that could be maximized during pollen collection by bumblebees (Bombus spp.) foraging on different lupin species (Lupinus spp.): pollen collected per inflorescence, pollen collection rate (gross benefits/time) and pollen collection efficiency (gross benefits/costs). Bees visiting lupin inflorescences begin foraging low on al? inflorescence and then move upward through a gradient of increasing pollen availability. To maximize each currency,ne predicted that a bee would begin foraging at a different position along a lupin inflorescence, depending on the relative influences of the time and energy costs associated with handling flowers-and flight. Based on comparisons of observed and predicted starting positions for seven situations,maximization of gross pollen-collection efficiency predicted observed behaviour better than either pollen collected per inflorescence or gross rate of pollen collection. Such maximization of pollen-collection efficiency would enhance a bee's lifetime input of pollen to her colony, as has been demonstrated for nectar-collecting bees. Hence, the economics of foraging for non-energetic resources do not differ qualitatively from foraging for energy. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Males compete in various ways for mating and reproductive success. Phylogenetic factors and local ecology affect female spatial and temporal distributions, which in turn influence the form of male competition, sexual selection and mating systems. In prairie rattlesnake, Crotalus viridis viridis, populations where (1) males seek females during a brief reproductive period, (2) females are relatively few, and (3) females are widely and unpredictably distributed spatially into small discrete clusters, males should show efficient mate searching more so than time-consuming 'handling' (e.g. fighting, mate persuasion). Natural history studies and computer and mathematical modelling generate this expectation. This long-term field study of prairie rattlesnakes in Wyoming indicated that straight-line (i.e. fixed-bearing) movement by males is critical for mate location and, thus, for mating success. Males that searched along straight-line paths located and mated with more females than those having less straight movement paths. Fighting was observed rarely, and no relationship was found between males' success at mate location and body mass and/or snout-vent length. Thus a range of traits may mediate competition and mating success among male snakes. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although nepotism has been evidenced in various areas of primate behaviour, relatively little is known on how it varies with degree of relatedness (r). For example, nepotism might decrease proportionally and asymptotically with relatedness, or it might decrease up to a certain relatedness threshold, beyond which it plummets. This issue was investigated by analysing one type of beneficent behaviours, agonistic support (third-party interventions in conflicts), among laboratory-housed female Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata. In previous experiments, mothers and sisters were tested in situations in which they could help their daughters and younger sisters to outrank peers, which they did successfully. In the present experiments, grandmothers and aunts were tested using similar protocols. In the presence of their grandmother, granddaughters outranked all dominant peers, but in the presence of their aunt, nieces could not. These combined results point to a relatedness threshold for effective nepotistic aiding above the aunt-niece level of relatedness. Analysis of 1002 interventions received by juvenile females from various categories of adult female kin in the unmanipulated, complete group confirmed this hypothesis. Finally, 11 years of data on the distribution of female homosexual activity according to relatedness provided complementary evidence for the threshold hypothesis. Non-kin females commonly engaged in homosexual interactions, as did aunts and nieces, but closer kin never did, suggesting that aunts and nieces do not recognize each other as kin for the purpose of sexual interactions. Together, these results point to a relatedness threshold for nepotistic aiding at r = 0.25 and suggest that this threshold is not behaviour-specific but generalized.

   RISK; STORAGE; WINTER; STARVATION; DOMINANCE; SPARROW
AB Many passerines wintering in temperate regions rely on their energy reserves for survival during periods when foraging is not possible. Excessive fat reserves, however, increase body mass and thus reduce agility and speed in flight, imposing a survival cost when the bird tries to escape from predators. If fat reserves reflect a trade-off between starvation and predation risks, the size of reserves could be expected to vary with the perceived level of predation risk. The hypothesis that increasing the relative risk of predation results in decreased body mass was tested experimentally using captive greenfinches, Carduelis chloris. Greenfinches show winter fattening and take flight when disturbed and are therefore suitable for testing the hypothesis. The perceived predation risk, a stuffed predator moved in the birds' environment, resulted in lower body mass. Handling the birds had the same effect. These results support theoretical predictions and some field data regarding the adjustment of body mass to variation in the predation risk. They further suggest, in line with other studies, that birds are able to change body mass in response to proximate factors.

AB Few studies have examined the role of steroid hormones in mediating tactic-associated differences in male agonistic behaviour. Long-term (24 h) steroid hormone responses to winning staged male-male encounters in different morphs of free-living male tree lizards, Urosaurus ornatus, were studied. Males belong to either an aggressive, territorial (type) morph or to a less aggressive, non-territorial morph. On the day after winning a staged male-male encounter, males of the less aggressive morph showed elevated plasma levels of the stress hormone corticosterone and depressed levels of the sex steroid testosterone compared with controls of the same morph not subjected to an encounter. In contrast, males of the more aggressive, territorial morph that engaged in an encounter had levels of both hormones similar to controls. This morph difference in hormonal response is the first endocrine difference between adult males of the two tree lizard morphs detected to date; previous field and laboratory studies showed no morph difference in resting hormone levels or in hormonal responses 30 min following male-male encounters. The consequences of these morph differences in hormone responses to male-male interactions are unknown, but the hormonal changes in the less aggressive morph may (1) influence spontaneous agonistic behaviour, (2) influence agonistic behaviour in subsequent male-male interactions or (3) reflect morph differences in physiological capabilities related to energy expenditure during male-male interactions.

AB Although wood ants frequently encounter defended prey, there has been little study of how anti-predator traits affect worker behaviour patterns. Interactions between western thatching ants, Formica obscuripes Forel, and chemically defended conifer sawfly larvae were observed in a laboratory setting. Individual ant responses to sawflies were strongly affected by prey defence status and predator approach behaviour. Solitary workers that initially examined (antennated, mandibulated) sawflies were more likely to abandon larvae than were workers that attacked immediately. Ants were more likely to persist in prey encounters when sawflies were experimentally depleted of chemical defence. Attacking workers attracted recruits more rapidly than did ants that examined prey. Prey discovery resulted in a decline in honey water attendance at food stations as additional workers engaged in prey retrieval, but did not affect overall foraging rate. Survival of fully defended larvae was significantly greater than that of depleted prey. Sawfly defences appear most effective in the early stages of encounters with ants. A generalist diet and the opportunistic nature of prey exploitation have probably precluded the evolution of refined wood ant responses to sawfly defences.

AB Male common grackles, Quiscalus quiscula, sing one song type each, yet females prefer multiple songs. A pre-existing sensory bias explanation has been proposed to account for these results. Using phylogenetic analysis and published behavioural studies, (1) it is shown that the single-song condition of males is likely to be the derived state, and (2) it is suggested that female common grackles' preference for multiple songs may not be surprising given their natural history, and may in fact be a functional preference. The idea that the female preference is also ancestral and serves no current function, however, cannot be ruled out. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB An animal can be said to teach if, at some cost or at least without obtaining an immediate benefit for itself, it modifies its behaviour in the presence of a naive observer, such that the observer acquires a skill more efficiently than it might otherwise do. An important theoretical issue is the extent to which the demonstrator's behaviour is sensitive to the improving skill level of the observer. This study determined whether domestic hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, were sensitive to feeding errors by their chicks. The feeding displays of 12 hens were studied in two contexts: (1) in the presence of chicks that fed on a food colour that was palatable to the hen, and hence made no apparent feeding errors and (2) in the presence of chicks that fed on a food colour that was unpalatable to the hen, and hence made apparent feeding errors. Both groups of chicks, in reality, fed on palatable food. Hens responded more intensely to chicks that made apparent feeding errors. Hens increased the rate of ground pecking and scratching when they had no food available, and increased the rate of food pecking (although not food ingestion) when they were given food. It is suggested that hens are sensitive to perceived chick error, and that the costs of increased display intensity are balanced by the benefits of attracting chicks to more profitable food items.

AB Observations of foraging activities were conducted on two species of generalist grasshoppers that are cryptic on foliage, Schistocerca nitens and S. shoshone, which have overlapping distributions in the southwestern region of the U.S.A. Patterns of activity, feed lengths, food choice and switching between host plants were examined by continuous recording of individuals for up to 8 h each in the held. Long feeding bouts and limited locomotion were the norm in both species. Individuals often remained with one plant for most of the day, but then typically fed on more than one tissue type during an observation period. Declining feeding-bout lengths on a single species or tissue were common, as were increased feeding-bout lengths on novel foods. The data from these foliage-cryptic species contrasted with data collected previously on other species that were ground-dwelling or aposematic, and demonstrated different foraging strategies. Possible costs and benefits of the two contrasting foraging strategies are discussed. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   HYPOTHESIS
AB The development and evolution of bird songs may be influenced by the mechanisms that underlie sound production, although the nature of this influence is not well understood. Here it is shown experimentally that vocal development in songbirds can be affected by physical limits on how birds are able to sing. Young swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, were presented with conspecific song models modified such that rates of syllable repetition were increased above normal rates. Imitations of these songs were inaccurate in ways that indicated motor constraints on vocal performance and that did not indicate perceptual or memory-based constraints. Some song imitations were deficient in trill tempo and/or syllable composition, and others were produced with a species-atypical 'broken' syntax, in which pauses were interspersed within songs. These results illustrate how the development and evolution of trill structure can be limited by motor constraints on vocal production, and also identify a possible mechanism for the evolution of a novel form of song syntax.

AB Six experiments were undertaken to explore the effects of residual trails deposited by one Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus, on subsequent choice of path by conspecifics. A rat moving away from (but not towards) a feeding site deposited a trail that biased path choice by its fellows. The relative attractiveness of a trail was affected by the number of times it had been traversed by a rat on its way to and from food, but not by the amount of food a rat ate before depositing a trail. There was no evidence that trails contained information that would allow a rat to move directly towards food rather than directly away from it. Possible sources of the trails deposited by Norway rats as they leave feeding sites are discussed. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ID FISH; COEXISTENCE; POECILIIDAE; BEHAVIOR
AB Few studies have investigated the innate tendencies of newborn fish to avoid cannibalism by parents. Parental avoidance by neonates of viviparous fish in the genus Poeciliopsis was examined. Hybridization between P. monacha, a cannibalistic species, and P. lucida, a non-cannibalistic species, produced the clonally reproducing, all-female form, P. monacha-lucida. Naturally occurring clones of P. monacha-lucida tend to be intermediate with respect to cannibalism. Neonates of P. lucida did not avoid their female parent, whereas neonates of the cannibalistic forms, P. monacha and P. monacha-lucida, clearly did. Examination of several laboratory-synthesized P. monacha-lucida strains revealed that differences between clones in their innate avoidance behaviour were fixed from genetic variance that existed in their P. monacha sexual ancestors. Parental avoidance increased with size at birth, which might represent a successful anti-cannibalism strategy in nature. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB This study evaluated whether diversity in male ornamental traits between populations is associated with a corresponding diversity in female preferences, or whether males can evolve divergent ornamentation even when female preferences remain relatively consistent. Video editing techniques were used to manipulate the coloration of recorded images of male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and these images were presented to female sticklebacks from populations with black or red male nuptial coloration. Overall, females responded preferentially to images of males with black or red coloration over images with the dull coloration of females and some males; although preferences differed between populations, these differences were not statistically significant. Thus divergence in male ornaments was probably not caused by a corresponding divergence in female preferences. The results do not, however, allow clear discrimination between the various hypotheses for the evolution of female mating preferences. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

Chicks learned to peck preferentially at laughing gull models that fed them and to reduce their pecking at models that did not; they learned best when the model was unusual. Chicks were also able to learn to prefer a particular laughing gull mew call over a mew call recorded from a different laughing gull. When auditory cues were present during conditioning, the degree and importance of visual learning sharply declined. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

TI CALLING BY DOMESTIC PIGLETS - RELIABLE SIGNALS OF NEED
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PHILIP SIDNEY GAME; SUCKLING BEHAVIOR; PIGS; VOCALIZATIONS
AB Two manipulations were performed on domestic piglets to determine whether differences in calling during periods of separation from the mother can indicate differences in need. In both cases, the aim was to manipulate the piglet's need for the sow's attention. In the first manipulation a 'thriving' piglet (i.e. the piglet with the heaviest weight and most rapid weight gain) and a 'non-thriving' one (lightest and slowest weight gain) were selected from each of 15 litters. The two piglets were removed from the sow and litter and recorded for 13 min in separate isolated enclosures. For the second manipulation, two piglets of intermediate weight and weight gain were selected from each of the same 15 litters, and were removed from the sow during nursing under one of two conditions. The 'unfed' piglet was removed just before the milk ejection and the 'fed' one just after receiving milk. Both were recorded as in the first manipulation. 'Non-thriving' and 'unfed' piglets called more and used more high-frequency calls, longer calls, and calls that rose more in frequency than their 'thriving' and 'fed' litter-mates. By means of a playback experiment, the assumption that sows respond to these piglet calls was tested. Sows were more likely to vocalize and approach the loudspeaker during playback of the piglet isolation calls than during playback of white noise. It is argued that if a piglet's calls provide reliable information about its need for the sow's resources, then this calling can be used as a measure of its welfare. These results are consistent with theoretical models of honest signalling. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Male red deer, Cervus elaphus, in Donana National Park (Spain) defend mating territories at places that females visit during their foraging movements. To investigate whether females were attracted to males or to sites, territories were fenced so that the territorial males had to defend a new territory at a different site. In all cases, males attracted fewer females after they had moved. In control experiments, (1) unmanipulated territories did not lose females in the same way, (2) when the fence was removed, all males recovered some of the lost females, and (3) territorial males gained females when they were experimentally moved to better forage areas. Two kinds of territories were identified: those containing good swards and those at routes of female traffic. Contrary to predictions under the male-attraction hypothesis, the decrease in number of females after the experimental manipulation was greater the more females formerly used that territory. In those territories delimiting good swards, the quality of grass predicted both the number and the proportion of females lost after the male was moved from this site. The results demonstrate that territoriality of red deer in Donana is a resource-defence system, where the success of a male largely depends on the location of his territory.

AB The effects of age, sex and previous experience on colour avoidance in northern bobwhites, Colinus virginianus, were evaluated. First, unlearned colour preferences were determined by measuring pecking by 52 1-day-old bobwhite chicks at pinheads of four colours. The number of first pecks and the total number of pecks varied significantly among colours (P=0.011 and P<0.001, respectively). Both measures showed that the descending order of preference was blue>green>yellow>red. There were no clear sex differences in pecking preference. A second experiment used a two-cup avoidance test to evaluate the effects of sex and previous experience on avoidance of coloured grain by juvenile bobwhite. Forty 11-week-old birds were pre-exposed for 7 days to either multi-coloured or undyed food, and then tested for 5 days for avoidance of red or blue food. Red food was avoided relative to undyed food (preference ratio=0.426, P=0.004), whereas blue food was not avoided. Sex of bird, pre-exposure to coloured food, and day of test had no significant effect on colour avoidance. Finally, 26 of the same birds were retested at the age of 31 weeks for avoidance of blue and red food. Results indicated no change in colour avoidance with age. Although these experiments failed to replicate a sex difference in colour avoidance that we found in a previous study, they did demonstrate that bobwhites show an unlearned aversion to red which is persistent and resistant to extinction. Because red is a common warning colour in insects, this aversion may be an adaptation for avoiding aposematically coloured prey. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Grooming is among the most commonly performed parasite defence behaviour patterns and is effective in removing ticks. Because both tick infestation and grooming activity have a cost, natural selection should favour individuals that match the current level of tick threat with an appropriate level of tick-defence grooming effort. To test this notion, the relationship between seasonal tick challenge and grooming rate by wild, free-ranging impala, Aepyceros melampus, was investigated in Zimbabwe. Adult ticks in the vegetation showed a dramatic decrease from the warm/wet season to the hot/dry season, declining from 2.4 ticks per drag sample and 58 ticks per removal plot to virtually nil. This decline was mirrored by an associated decline in grooming rate by all impala in which self-oral and scratch grooming bouts per h decreased 30-45%. Allogrooming encounters per h (corrected for lying-down time) and total allogrooming delivered, as measured by bouts or episodes delivered per h, decreased for males but did not change for females. Overall percentage of time spent in all forms of grooming declined 37-57%. Multiple regression analysis revealed that, with the seasonal effects of temperature and rainfall held constant, self-grooming rates were significantly and positively correlated with adult tick challenge, indicating that impala adjusted self grooming to seasonal fluctuations in adult tick threat. Allogrooming delivered was influenced by nymphal tick challenge; because the larvae and nymphs of the most abundant tick species favour the ear and neck region (where allogrooming is concentrated), allogrooming appears to function to remove immature ticks from body regions inaccessible to self-oral grooming. These results are what would be expected if grooming serves to remove ticks before they can attach and engorge, and supports the view that grooming is an evolved response to the threat of excessive tick burden in the impala's natural environment.

TI MATING BETWEEN 2 HYBRIDIZING SPECIES, VIVIPARUS-ATER AND V-CONTECTUS
   (MOLLUSCA, PROSOBRANCHIA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID HOMOGAMY; SEARCH
AB The aquatic snails Viviparus ater and V. contectus are sympatric in several places in southern Europe; they differ morphologically, karyotypically and in their life-history traits. Previous work has shown weak introgression of allozyme markers associated with high heterospecific mating rates in a natural population at Lazise in Lake Garda, northern Italy. Snails were kept in small artificial ponds with equal numbers of males and females of both species, and rates of assortative mating, species-specific mating propensities, and the relative frequencies of the reciprocal heterospecific mating pairs (V. ater males x V. contectus females and V. contectus males x V. ater females) were determined. Randomization tests were used to control statistically for problems inherent in many assortative mating experiments. The extent of assortative mating under relative densities of 50 V. ater:1 V. contectus, which is closer to the natural condition at Lazise, was also determined. Heterospecific matings occurred at a rate of 10.9% at relative densities of 1:1, significantly different from random mating. The heterospecific mating rate of V. contectus was much higher (75%) when it was at low density. Viviparus contectus females had significantly higher mating propensities than did V. ater females. In contrast to field data, the relative frequencies of the reciprocal heterospecific mating pairs were similar in the experiments, suggesting that factors other than mate choice may be responsible for the higher frequency of V. ater males x V. contectus females in the field. Assortative mating in Viviparus comprises an insignificant barrier to introgression even in conjunction with the low fitness of hybrids, especially where the relative population densities of the species differ.

TI EFFECTS ON FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF FAMILIARITY AND EXPERIENCE
   AMONG MALE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID AGELAIUS-PHOENICEUS; NEST DEFENSE; NEIGHBORS; POLYGYNY
AB Evidence from a long-term study of red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoenicus, in Washington has indicated that females preferentially nest in territories of males that are familiar with their neighbours, perhaps because familiar males cooperate in nest defence. Data presented here from a long-term study in Ontario indicated that an average of 55% of territorial males returned from one year to the next, and of those, 81% reoccupied their former territories, so males were often familiar with their neighbours. Also 40% of breeding females returned to the study area between years (76% of those individuals returned to the same marsh), allowing the possibility of females recognizing males that were familiar with each other. However, no advantage to females, or preference by females, for familiarity among male neighbours was found. In fact, females were more successful on territories with one or more new neighbours because of reduced nest predation. These results, in conjunction with observations of male interactions with their neighbours during focal observations and model predator presentations, provided no evidence that familiarity among males was advantageous to females or facilitated cooperative nest defence by males. The effect of familiarity among neighbours may vary geographically (in Washington and Ontario) because the principal species of nest predators differ geographically and these predators may respond differently to variation in nesting density. Having new males as neighbours may be advantageous in Ontario because new neighbours are inexperienced and attract fewer females. In turn, local nest density is reduced, resulting in lower predation. When neighbours do help defend nests on their neighbour's territory, they may be defending young they have sired through extra-pair copulations, so it may be prudent to continue regarding territorial neighbours as adversaries, even when their behaviour appears cooperative.

AB This study evaluated the offspring viability prediction of the condition-dependent and Fisherian models of female choice in the guppy. Families of full-sibling females were bred with the male they preferred or did not prefer in a choice experiment. The physical condition, sexual behaviour and coloration of the offspring were evaluated. There were no significant differences between offspring attributable to the type of sire. However, there were significant family and sire-type by family interactions for physical condition, male mating behaviour and coloration. These significant effects indicate that consistency within families may be due to genetic effects. Genetic analyses indicate that genetic variation probably exists for prolonged swimming performance, physical condition and display rate. The results of this study and other studies on other fish have shown that these measures of constitution are correlated with components of viability. These results are interpreted in the framework of the condition-dependent and Fisherian models of female choice.

TI WHY DO SOME CADDIS LARVAE IN RUNNING WATERS CONSTRUCT HEAVY, BULKY CASES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID TRICHOPTERA
AB Lateral 'ballast stones' of empty cases of lotic Silo pallipes caddis larvae had a weak, positive effect on current resistance when intact cases were compared with those devoid of their extra stones. However, this ballast effect made up only 2.5% of the current resistance of cases inhabited by larvae. Small bullhead, Cottus gobio, and brown trout, Salmo trutta, preferentially attacked larvae in cases from which the lateral stones had been removed. Increased survival because of reduced attack frequency should be more important than a slightly lowered risk of being pushed away by the current. Silo pallipes larvae did not show any flexible case-building behaviour: neither different current regimes nor odour from bullheads affected the mass or width, respectively, of the cases constructed.

AB Extra-pair courtship and copulatory patterns were examined in a freely breeding laboratory population of wild-type, domesticated zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Prior to release into the experimental aviary, each male received either two red bands (shown previously to be attractive in heterosexual tests) or two green bands (unattractive to females) as part of a unique combination of four leg bands; the remaining two bands were of neutral colours. Females received neutral combinations. Bill colour, which also affects heterosexual attractiveness, was also scored. Bill colour had only minor effects here, but band colour effects were substantial. Red-banded males participated in unforced extra-pair copulations more commonly than did green-banded males. Band colour did not influence male participation in forced extra-pair copulations. Mates of red-banded males (red-mated females) deterred extra-pair courtship more than green-mated females; green-mated females participated in extra-pair courtship and extra-pair copulation more frequently. Results indicate that females displayed active choice of extra-pair copulatory partners and employed conditional tactics for obtaining these partners. Males showed little differentiation in extra-pair tactics based on attractiveness or mating status. However, assuming that rates of extra-pair fertilization are proportional to rates of extra-pair copulation, red-banded males would appear to have both higher paternity confidence and greater success in obtaining extra-pair fertilizations.

AB The potential benefits of philopatry versus dispersal were investigated in yearling males of the migratory collared flycatcher on the island of Gotland, Sweden. Data on mating success from 4 years showed that philopatric males (i.e. hatched in the nestbox plot) mated more quickly after arrival than immigrant males and were less likely to remain unmated. Among mated males, however, there was no significant difference in reproductive success between philopatric and immigrant males. Data on nestbox preferences gathered from 8 years revealed that philopatric males on average chose higher-ranked boxes than immigrant males. Male mating success was associated with the preference score of the nestbox, suggesting that the observed mating advantage of philopatric males was probably a consequence of the higher quality of their nest site. It is suggested that prior local experience facilitates nest site selection in philopatric birds when high search costs force individuals to choose between a small number of alternative sites. Dispersal may partly be a consequence of prohibitively high time costs of searching and finding the way back home. Male-biased philopatry in the collared flycatcher may then be a result of a sex-difference in the time costs of searching for and assessing alternative sites.

TI ANTIPREDATOR STRATEGIES OF IMMATURE THOMSON GAZELLES - HIDING AND THE
   PRONE RESPONSE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of hiding and the prone response as anti-predator strategies by immature Thomson''s gazelles, Gazella thomsoni, was investigated. Hiding, a behaviour restricted almost entirely to fawns, decreased the probability that infants would be found by cheetahs, Acinonyx jubatus, at a time when their ability to outrun predators was poor. The period of transition from hiding to active appeared to be a time of high mortality; although no increase in the ability of fawns to outrun predators with  age could be detected, older fawns still spent more time out of hiding, increasing the probability that they would be spotted by predators. Once chased, dropping down out of sight and adopting the prone response was associated with a decreased probability of capture. Fawns that dropped down further from approaching cheetahs were less likely to be found than those that dropped down when the predator was closer. Since fawns that dropped down had mothers that detected approaching predators further  away and more vigilant mothers detected approaching cheetahs at greater distances, increased maternal vigilance had a direct payoff in terms of increased infant survivorship.

TI THE ROLE OF MALES IN THE STIMULATION OF REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION IN FEMALE
   COTTON-TOP TAMARINS, SAGUINUS-O OEDIPUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When mature female cotton-top tamarins are removed from the reproductive suppression of their mother, reproductive hormone levels and scent-marking behaviour increase, but the females do not ovulate until paired with an unfamiliar male. This study determined the effects of exposure to male urine and direct contact with both familiar and unfamiliar males on sociosexual behaviour and urinary oestrone and gonadotropin secretion in pubertal females. Seven females were observed when they resided  with family members, in isolation, and after pairing with an unfamiliar male. Initially, the females were housed either in their natal group or with a familiar male(s) only. When housed in isolation, the females were exposed daily to either male urine or water. Neither urinary hormone levels nor sociosexual behaviour differed between females housed with their natal group and those housed only with familiar males. In isolation, urinary oestrone and scent marking increased, but hormonal excretion  was acyclic; daily exposure to male urine did not influence hormones or behaviour. Sexual behaviour was almost never observed when females lived with family members but increased significantly after pairing. One female began ovulatory cycling in the presence of a familiar male, no female began cycling in isolation, and five females began cycling after pairing. The results from this and previous studies indicate that the onset of sexual behaviour and ovarian cyclicity may require not only  release from suppression by the mother but also release from suppression by other family members as well as direct contact or stimulation from an unfamiliar male. The combination of suppressive and stimulatory factors may serve as mechanisms for avoidance of inbreeding and to promote group dispersal.

TI THE USE OF LOCAL LANDMARKS BY FORAGING GOLDFISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Goldfish, Carassius auratus, were introduced into an arena tank containing two symmetrically placed gravel-filled trays, one of which contained hidden food. In the absence of additional structures in the tank, the accuracy of food-patch choice (i.e. the proportion of individuals contacting the full tray before the empty tray) was close to that expected assuming random binary choice. Accuracy improved significantly, however, when landmarks (a rock/plant combination or multicolored plastic  columns) were positioned close to the food patch. Choice performance also improved when the plastic columns were placed in the opposite (non-food) half of the tank, indicating a capacity for indirect landmark usage as distinct from direct visual cueing. Latencies to feeding decreased with experience in all treatments, but were significantly lower in the presence of landmarks. Exploratory sampling behaviour, as indicated by the number of visits to the empty patch once food had been found during  a trial, was significantly less frequent in the presence of strong landmarks. Fish in all treatments increased the frequency of sampling visits following a reversal of full and empty patches. Reliance on memory-based spatial behaviour may therefore vary according to the nature and complexity of the visual environment.

TI TERRITORIALITY AS A MATING STRATEGY IN RED DEER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The mating behaviour of red deer stags, Cervus elaphus, has been extensively described as harem defence. However, it appears that territoriality may be chosen as a mating strategy when certain conditions are met. In a study area in southwestern Spain, early on in the rut, about 58% of adult males established territories in preferred areas, defended the territory against other males even in the absence of females, and courted females only within territorial boundaries. The mean territory size  was about 2.3 ha. The later a male settled on his territory during the rut the fewer the females he was able to keep. The preferred areas where males established territories were also extensively used by females even before the start of the rut. The number of females per ha before the onset of the rut was positively correlated with the cumulative number of hinds that each male kept later on. Hence the reproductive success of males was largely influenced by the location of their territory. Such intensive use by females of a highly productive area for feeding and daily passage in an otherwise low-resource environment appears to promote the defence of territories located in the richest area. This paper provides the first evidence for territorial defence of mates in red deer and may contribute to the understanding of the dynamic nature of mating behaviour in ungulates.

TI FEMALE PREFERENCES, MALE DECISION RULES AND THE EVOLUTION OF LEKS IN THE
   GREAT SNIPE GALLINAGO-MEDIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB On the leks of great snipe, dominant, subdominant and subordinate males can be distinguished. Dominant males display in more central territories than subdominant and subordinate males. Therefore females may prefer central males and males may compete for central territores (the position hypothesis). Alternatively, dominant males may be more attractive to females than other males. If so, less dominant males may gather around dominants attempting to intercept females on their way to a dominant  male (the attractiveness hypothesis). Thus, the central position of dominant males may be a consequence instead of a cause of high mating success. To discriminate between these two hypotheses, a male removal experiment was performed. When dominant males were removed, the territories were left unoccupied by neighbouring males. When subdominant or subordinate males were removed these territories were immediately occupied. When a stuffed male was presented together with a playback of a natural call within male territores, dominant males ignored the decoy whereas other males approached and/or attacked it. Male dominance scores and display rates were both correlated with mating success on a small (ca. seven males) lek on which there were no position effects. These results support the attractiveness hypothesis and contradict the position hypothesis. Thus male aggregations during the mating period (leks) may have evolved because some males are unable to attract females on their own. The best mating strategy for such males would be to associate with attractive males.

TI DISPERSAL AND INBREEDING AVOIDANCE IN THE WHITE-FOOTED MOUSE,
   PEROMYSCUS-LEUCOPUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of inbreeding depression on dispersal tendencies in white-footed mice were investigated by experimentally measuring the reproductive success of females that artificially ''dispersed'' various distances. Observed natal dispersal distances were also compared against those predicted by a model in which competition for home range sites is the sole factors determining dispersal distance. In the population studied, the majority of juveniles of both sexes remained as adults on or adjacent to their natal home range. In artificial dispersal experiments, all measures of reproductive success for females mated with males that occupied home ranges located 1 inter-activity-centre distance away from their natal of centre of activity were similar or superior to that of females mated to males from 2 to 3 or 10 inter-activity-centre distances away. Though a significant inbreeding depression has been demonstrated in this population for full-sibling and half-sibling matings, high juvenile and adult mortality makes it probable that individuals dispersing even to an adjacent home range will rarely risk close inbreeding. Comparison of the probabilities of philopatry with a null model suggests that females are moving only as far as forced to by competition to find a vacant home range. Males seem to avoid settling in their natal home range, even if the resident adult males has disappeared. Males may be dispersing to avoid inbreeding, but other evidence suggests that females avoid  mating with close kin and male dispersal is a consequence, not a cause of inbreeding avoidance.

TI ACOUSTIC STRUCTURE AND RECEIVER RESPONSE IN DOMESTIC DOGS,
   CANIS-FAMILIARIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The hypothesis that short, rapidly repeated rising notes increase motor activity levels in canids, and that longer, continuous descending notes decrease activity was tested. Young laboratory-raised domestic dogs were trained in a repeated measures study to (1) come to the trainer and to (2) sit and stay for 2 s to two different acoustic stimuli: four short notes with a rising fundamental frequency and one long note with a descending fundamental frequency. While one long note was not more effective at eliciting a sit/stay response, four short notes were more effective at eliciting a come response and increasing motor activity levels than one longer continuous note. Thus, acoustic stimuli are not equipotent in eliciting responses that require changes in motor activity levels and could be used by signal senders to influence the behaviour of the signal receiver. The acoustic structures in the study are compared with vocalizations of mammals and birds that elicit approach, and/or  increase motor activity levels.

TI HOW ARE AGONISTIC ENCOUNTERS AMONG BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEES RESOLVED
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sequence of behaviour used during agonistic encounters among black-capped chickadees, Parus atricapillus, was investigated by videotaping encounters at a winter feeding station in southeastern Wisconsin [U.S.A.]. Lower-ranking individuals were more likely than higher-ranking ones to depart immediately upon the arrival of a second bird at the feeder, while higher-ranking birds were more likely to supplant birds immediately on arrival at the feeder. Two displays, one vocal (the Gargle)  and one visual (the Head-up) were used by the bird, but these displays appeared to have only limited roles in resolving encounters. Dominant birds were more likely than subordinates to use Head-ups and Gargles. Most encounters ended either after supplanting or after a series of movements that involved changes in orientation between the contestants (Ballet). During Ballet, losers tended to face away from their opponents, while winners tended to face their opponents. These differences between  winners and losers became apparent only as encounters progressed. Ballet may provide an opportunity for opponents to assess each other''s physical conditions or provide an opportunity for individuals to determine their opponents'' identities.

TI MALE COURTSHIP PHEROMONES INCREASE FEMALE RECEPTIVITY IN A PLETHODONTID
   SALAMANDER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of courtship pheromones on female receptivity was tested in the terrestrial plethodontid salamander Desmognathus ochrophaeus by staging encounters between 50 male-female pairs. Male mental glands were ablated to prevent uncontrolled delivery of the pheromones. Glands were used to create a pheromone extract for experimental application. A female was treated with the extract 30 min prior to a courthsip encounter and, in other encounters, the same female was treated with a saline  control. Observations of courtship behaviour were taken by scan samples every 15 min for 6 h. A female receiving the pheromone treatment mated an average of 28% (59 min) sooner than she did after receiving the control treatment. These results are the first quantitative documentation that courtship pheromones function in salamanders directly to increase female receptivity.

TI INTRASEXUAL COMPETITION, MATING SYSTEM AND NATAL DISPERSAL IN SONG
   SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study examines relationships between natal dispersal and intrasexual competition, the mating system, inbreeding, inheritance and social status in five cohorts of song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, resident on Mandarte Island, British Columbia, Canada. The role of natal dispersal in population regulation is also considered. Several hypotheses of natal dispersal were tested with experimental and observational data. Dispersal distances were similar among the sexes, but distances depended  strongly on point of origin on the island. Adding supplemental food on 15 territories dramatically reduced dispersal distance in each sex relative to controls, supporting the hypothesis that dispersal results from intrasexual competition for access to high-quality breeding territories. No evidence for genetic determination of dispersal distance, or for mechanisms that serve to prevent close inbreeding, was found. Social status was related to the time of settlement, but not to distance dispersed  on Mandarte. Subordinate birds emigrated from Mandarte more often than dominants. Dispersal distance on Mandarte was unrelated to the probability of settling with a relative, but neither distance moved nor relatedness of the first mate were related to lifetime reproductive success. Disappearance of juveniles coincided with periods of territoriality in late summer through autumn and late winter through spring. The proportion of juveniles recruiting to the population declined as the number of  territorial adults in the autumn increased. These results suggest a close link between intrasexual competition for breeding territories, natal dispersal and population regulation.

TI DIFFERENTIAL INFANTICIDE BY ADULT CURLY-TAILED LIZARDS,
   LEIOCEPHALUS-SCHREIBERSI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The curly-tailed lizard is a ground-dwelling, territorial species, whose home range areas were stable and averaged 79 m2 (males), 43 m2 (females) and 6 m2 (juveniles). Every male had one to three females within his home range. The average home range overlap varied within and between age and sex classes, from 8% of male home range areas overlapping with juvenile home ranges to 100% of juvenile home ranges coinciding within male home ranges. Except for three, each of the 24 juveniles on the  study area was exclusively associated with an adult male and female whose territorial behaviour prevented access of other adults to the juvenile. This was significant because 36% of the tested resident adults (three males, six females) attacked tethered conspecific juveniles and were considered cannibals. All 24 resident juvenile home ranges were within non-cannibal adult home ranges. Only three juveniles were at risk by having their home ranges also overlapped by a cannabalistic adult. No  adult-free refugium existed for juveniles as their separation distances from non-cannibalistic adults averaged 1.0 m (cannibals had no juveniles nearby). Our data indicate that: (1) exploitative infanticide may be a prime source of juvenile mortality; (2) stable, coinciding territories of a non-cannibalistic adult male and female provide associated juveniles with protection against cannibal adult interlopers: and (3) 88%, of resident juveniles were being protected from possible cannibalism by  only 30% of the adults on the study area.

TI POST-WEANING ASSOCIATIONS AMONG BISON MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB For gregarious ungulates, associations between mothers and their adult daughters may play an important role in the organization of social groups. We examined the spatial relations of bison. Bison bison, mothers and daughters during the first 3 years to determine whether dyads continue to associate after weaning and, if so, which member of the dyad is primarily responsible. Between weaning and the birth of the mother''s next calf, most daughters spent 1 or 2 months in temporary separation from their mothers. This separation did not appear to result from maternal aggression since mothers showed less aggression in the second half of the nursing period than in the first. Mothers and daughters continued to associate after the mother''s next calf was born, though less closely than before. In their second and third years, weaned daughters spent more time in groups with their mothers than with randomly chosen control cows. Mothers and daughters also approached and followed each other more  frequently, and spent more time near each other, than did daughters and controls. The weaned yearlings of parturient cows spent less time in close proximity to their mothers than did the nursing yearlings of barren cows. However, both groups showed similar frequencies of contact maintenance behaviour. Post-weaning shifts in spatial relations involved increasing filial independence and increased maternal efforts at contact maintenance. The closeness with which dyads associated after weaning was  positively correlated with maternal contributions to maintenance of proximity. Daughters benefited from post-weaning association in that they spent more time in the centre of groups and were less often displaced by other animals when their mothers were in the group than when they were not.

TI EARLY EXPERIENCE, REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, AND DEVELOPMENT OF PARENTAL
   BEHAVIOR IN MONGOLIAN GERBILS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Extended residence by non-breeding subadult ''helpers'' within families or communal groups has traditionally been explained by the theory of inclusive fitness. However, the theory of inclusive fitness does not account for cases in which helpers do not promote the survival of siblings or in cases where helpers are unrelated or only distantly related to offspring. We investigated the hypothesis that Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus, contribute to their individual fitness while living as  non-breeders in their natal family group. Breeding pairs of gerbils were constituted so that the male, female, neither, or both members of the breeding pair received experience with younger siblings while in the natal group. Prior experience with younger siblings affected reproductive performance. Pairs in which males were experienced produced their first litter significantly sooner than pairs with inexperienced males. Pairs with at least one experienced member were also more likely to produce a litter within 50 days of pairing (16 of 26 pairs) than pairs in which neither member was experienced (one of seven pairs). Pups born to pairs with experienced males gained weight more rapidly and had earlier eye opening for the first litter than pups born to pair with inexperienced males. Extended residence in breeding groups by non-breeders could contribute to individual reproductive success through enhanced breeding performance.

TI FEMALE AGGREGATION IN PLATYCYPHA-CALIGATA (ODONATA, CHLOROCYPHIDAE) - A
   TACTIC TO EVADE MALE INTERFERENCE DURING OVIPOSITION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Females of the African damselfly Platycypha caligata (Selys) oviposit on barkless driftwood in streams. Territorial males perform conspicuous courtship displays at these sites. Approaching males can interrupt the oviposition and force the female to fly off. In this study, receptive females landed on perches near the oviposition site where tandem formation and copulation took place. Non-receptive females showed behavioural adaptations to repulse the male''s courtship and to evade further copulations. At locations with several potential oviposition sites most females aggregated at only a few. Ovipositions in groups lasted longer than those in solitary females. The presence of ovipositing females influenced other females in their choice of site. Approaching females preferred sites with already ovipositing individuals. Females forced to fly off by courting males tried to land near resident females again. Joining a group was advantageous, as solitary egg-laying individuals were  intercepted more frequently by males than were females within groups. Group formation and the wing-spreading display of the courted female and her neighbours are interpreted as collective defence mechanisms against male interference.

TI INFLUENCE OF DOMINANCE AND AGE ON MATE CHOICE IN BLACK-BILLED MAGPIES -
   AN EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The influence of age (adults of greater than 1 year and juveniles of less than 1 year) and dominance status on pair-formation in captive black-billed magpies, Pica pica, was recorded in 32 flocks of five birds each. Adult and juvenile males of alpha dominance status paired equally frequently and more often than subordinates in these two age classes. All but one of the subordinate males that paired were adult. Moreover, only adult males were involved in second pair-formations (pairs that formed in flocks subsequent to the first pair-formation). The pairing success of females was independent of their dominance status, but adult females paired more often than juvenile females. In choice experiments females preferred adult to juvenile males and, among adult males, females preferred dominant to subordinate individuals. Males showed no preferences for either age class of females. The choice experiments suggested that the pattern of pairing in the flocks reflected female choice. The greater  pairing success of adult females may be a consequence of more intense courtship behaviour by adults than juveniles. The captive situation eliminated effects of territory quality on mate choice, but did not exclude its possible importance in mate choice in the wild.

TI FORAGING SUCCESS OF SOLITARY AND AGGREGATED SPIDERS - INSIGHTS INTO
   FLOCK FORMATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The normally solitary spider species, Achaearanea tepidariorum (C. L. Koch) (Aranae: Theridiidae), will cease cannibalism and forage in aggregations of webs when prey is very abundant. The circumstances of their shift from solitary to group foraging and the effect it has on capture efficiency and success were tested. Fabricated aggregations quickly dispersed at a site where captures were low, but these aggregations persisted for several months where the abundance of prey was high. When  resources were abundant for the spiders, the number of prey captured per day by solitary individuals was not different from the number captured by individuals foraging in groups; however, the biomass of prey obtained per day was greater for those individuals in groups. The variance in daily capture was substantially less for grouped individuals. Prey introduction experiments using both house flies and fruit flies revealed that groups captured a greater proportion of the prey that entered their web because of local enhancement and ricochet effects. These factors are probably responsible for the different variances in prey capture observed between aggregated and solitary individuals because they tend to distribute insect prey across more individuals. The different variances in foraging success are consistent with the predictions of risk-sensitive foraging theory that group foraging should be the risk-averse (low variance) foraging mode and solitary foraging should be the risk-prone  (high variance) foraging node.

TI THE NOTION OF ETHOLOGICAL NEED, MODELS OF MOTIVATION AND ANIMAL-WELFARE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The increasingly widespread use of the term ethological ''need'', implying that the welfare of animals in intensive husbandry systems will suffer if they are unable to express a normal range of behaviour patterns, has been criticized on the grounds that the term has not been clearly defined nor does it rest on a solid scientific foundation. In this critical review, evidence is presented which is consistent with the idea that there are cases in which the performance of behaviour itself does have motivationally significant consequences which are not necessarily related to functional requirements. For example, hens go through nest-building sequences during pre-laying behaviour, even though the nest they created previously is still available. This kind of finding is difficult to explain without involving the concept of ethological ''need''. Existing models of motivation are shown to be inadequate in explaining much of the behaviour seen in barren or impoverished environments, or when the animals are highly motivated in situations where consummatory behaviour is difficult to carry out. A modified model which can account for the occurrence of these stereotyped, abnormal and repetitive behaviour patterns is presented. The problems raised by equating the term ''need'' with ''necessity'' are discussed, particularly in the context of intensive environments where animals are faced with the task of occupying long periods of time with a limited range of behaviour patterns; the authors agree with Dawkins that one solution is its replacement by the concept of ''elasticity'', but argue that the notion of ''necessity'' may need to be broadened.

TI ORNAMENT SIZE INFLUENCES MATING SUCCESS IN MALE ROCK PTARMIGAN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Factors influencing male mating success in a natural population of rock ptarmigan, Lagopus mutus, were examined. In the first year of study, 1984, a survey of mating patterns revealed bigamous, monogamous and bachelor males in the population. In that year, males with the largest supraorbital combs had the most mates. After males were paired in 1984, they were captured and banded with a unique sequence of colored leg bands for future identification. The following year, returning males with comb coloured bands were more successful at obtaining mates than were males with similar comb size but without these band colours. These results suggest that among rock ptarmigan, the comb is a target of sexual selection and that a novel, non-genetic trait, when similar in colour to the target, can also influence a male''s mating success.

TI SOCIAL INFLUENCES ON VIGILANCE IN RABBITS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The potential advantage of corporate vigilance to rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, groups was studied in free-ranging rabbits that associated and cohabitated basically in male-female ''consorting'' pairs. Evening observations were conducted of rabbits during the breeding season. Levels of vigilance of an individual rabbit during feeding decreased with proximity to that rabbit''s ''consort''. In contrast, rabbits increased their vigilance in the presence of greater numbers of non-consort rabbits  either nearby or over 12 m away. An experiment using stuffed animals as stimulus objects indicated that the presence of a strange rabbit or of a fox increased the proportion of time that rabbits spent vigilant. Non-social factors also influenced vigilance and feeding. In particular, vigilance decreased as the evening proceeded and with higher temperature. For bucks only, it also decreased as the season advanced.

TI EFFECTS OF EARLY INGESTIONAL EXPERIENCES ON THE ACQUISITION OF
   APPROPRIATE FOOD SELECTION BY YOUNG CHICKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two experiments examined the role that initial feeding experiences with varying consequences have on the subsequent food selection behaviour of young chicks, Gallus gallus. In experiment 1, chicks were given a single feeding experience with food or sand having either beneficial (food for chicks aged 2.5 days), neutral (food for chicks aged 0.5 days, or sand for both age groups), or aversive (lithium chloride injection for both age groups) long-term consequences. Chicks aged 0.5 or 2.5 days did not discriminate between the two substances during a later pecking session. If the long-term consequences of the initial pecking experience were beneficial, the chicks increased their subsequent pecking regardless of whether they received the same substance as initially presented or the other substance. Similarly, if the long-term consequences were aversive, the chicks decreased their subsequent pecking. Experiment 2 showed that following differential feeding experience with two foods,  chicks aged 2.5 days did discriminate between these substances on the basis of the long-term consequences of ingesting each substance. Chicks received three sessions with one food to the pairing of aversive consequences with ingestion of a second food. The chicks decreased their subsequent pecking to the food that had been paired with illness while continuing to peck at the other food, as well as at a novel food. Initially, chicks associate the long-term consequences of ingestion with general feeding-related cues such as pecking (experiment 1). With additional feeding experiments, however, chicks associate cues that are food-specific with the long-term consequences of ingestion (experiment 2), thus allowing young chicks to select substances having beneficial consequences and to reject those having aversive consequences.

TI EARLY LEARNING AND BROOD DISCRIMINATION IN LEPTOTHORACINE ANTS
   (HYMENOPTERA, FORMICIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Workers of the ant species Leptothorax ambiguus and L. longispinosus were exposed to larvae of their own species (conspecific), to larvae of the other species in the pair (allospecific), or to no larvae at all (social isolation) during the first 10 days after adult eclosion. Workers exposed to conspecific larvae preferentially accepted conspecific larvae. Workers exposed to allospecific larvae and socially isolated workers accepted larvae of both species. These results may partially explain  why workers of these two species are vulnerable to enslavement by the obligatory parasites Harpagoxenus americanus and L. duloticus.

TI DOMINANCE RANK IN JUVENILE OLIVE BABOONS, PAPIO-ANUBIS - THE INFLUENCE
   OF GENDER, SIZE, MATERNAL RANK AND ORPHANING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Juvenile olive baboons were arranged in three single-sex rank orders according to: the direction of approach-withdraw interactions (supplants and avoids); the dominance ranks of the juveniles'' mothers; and relative juvenile size. Juvenile female rank as assessed from interactions closely approximated maternal rank, whereas juvenile male rank closely approximated size rank. The direction of interactions between juvenile and adult females agreed with maternal rank. The same was true of the younger juvenile males, although older juvenile males began to defeat adult females of all ranks. Juvenile males defeated juvenile females in almost all interactions, regardless of relative size or maternal rank. Finally, the effect on juvenile rank of the death of the mother or her loss of rank varied with the age and sex of the juvenile: males were not affected; young orphaned females fell in rank, but older orphans did not; and all daughters of females who lost rank fell in rank with their mothers.

TI MATING-BEHAVIOR AND MALE MATING SUCCESS IN THE GREEN TREEFROG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Green treefrogs, Hyla cinerea, at a study site in eastern Georgia [USA] behaved as prolonged breeders: there were many more males present each night than females, the arrival of which was unpredictable. Individual males were usually consistent in their behavior during a single night, and were most often observed calling. There was a weak, negative correlation between male size (snout-vent length,unless otherwise stated) and the frequency of satellite behavior, defined as a non-calling male''s being situated near a calling male. In 2 of 3 years, the mean size of males observed as satellites was less than that of the calling males with which they were associated on a given night; however, many satellites were the same size or larger than calling males. The distributions of matings per male during three seasons were not significantly different than Poisson distributions with the same means. Individual mating success was best predicted by attendance at the breeding site; mating success was negatively related to the frequency of satellite behavior in some analyses, but very little of the variance was explained. An exhaustive series of analyses failed to show any pattern of size-dependent mating, including weight-assortative mating, even when males that were frequently satellites were excluded. The relative sizes of males and females in amplexus had little effect on fertilization success. On a seasonal basis, males were clumped in their spatial distribution, and matings tended to occur where male density was highest. Individual males were highly variable in their patterns of movement, which were not correlated with size or mating success. Mating success was also unrelated to the frequency (Hz) of the low-frequency spectral peak in the advertisement call of the male; male size and weight were negatively correlated with the frequency of the low-frequency peak.

TI VOCAL RECOGNITION BETWEEN PARENTS AND YOUNG OF ANCIENT MURRELETS,
   SYNTHLIBORAMPHUS-ANTIQUUS (AVES, ALCIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Vocalization is a conspicuous feature of the departure of family groups of ancient murrelets, Synthliboramphus antiquus, from their colonies. The nocturnal timing of departure and the temporary separation of adults and chicks, followed by their reunion among many conspecifics, suggest that they recognize one another by their vocalizations. In this study, the calls of adults showed greater between than within-individual variability, indicating their potential for use in recognition. The calls  of sibling chicks were similar and chick calls showed greater variability between broods than within broods. In a playback experiment in a water-filled arena, chicks given the choice of parent''s and non-parent''s calls preferentially approached the parent''s calls and responded to them vocally. In two trials, playback of chick calls in a cove containing many adults seeking chicks attracted the correct parents. It is likely that both parents and chicks recognize each other''s calls and that this ability is based on their experience with the calls prior to departure. The chicks hear their parent''s calls each time a parent returns to the burrow to relieve its mate. Parents hear the calls of their two chicks after they hatch, a few days before departure. A system of mutual recognition may be fundamental for the success of the colony-departure strategy of ancient murrelets.

TI PATERNAL DEFENSE, CANNIBALISM AND POLYGAMY - FACTORS INFLUENCING THE
   REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF PAINTED GREENLING (PISCES, HEXAGRAMMIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relative costs and benefits of paternal egg-guarding behaviour were identified for painted greenling, Oxylebius pictus, a small fish inhabiting temperate rock reefs. Because males must guard embryos against conspecifics of both sexes and against other fishes, their movements were curtailed, and an energy cost resulted. The males'' somatic condition declined in proportion to the time spent guarding. Paternal males partially compensated by cannibalizing a small fraction of their progeny. Male O. pictus thus parasitize females by consuming their spawn. Polygamous matings were nonetheless advantageous for individual females as well as for males. The reproductive success of males and females increased for male broods with greater numbers of clutches, because there was a general dilution of predation loss in larger broods. The success of females, moreover, varied depending on the rank (chronological) order of spawning; success was greater for those that contributed earliest to  the male''s brood. The results support the hypothesis that the breeding cycles typical of paternal teleosts have evolved partly because of energy costs imposed by site-dependent care. For multiple-clutch species with protracted breeding seasons like O. pictus, the long-term benefits of polygamous spawnings perhaps outweight short-term losses sufficiently for filial cannibalism to evolve and be maintained. Alternatively (or in addition), the foraging milieu may exert a stronger average environmental influence than kin selection does.

TI PARTIAL PREFERENCES AND FORAGING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The maximization of the rate of energy gain in the standard model of prey choice requires that a prey type is either always accepted or always rejected. In contrast to this, most published data indicate that a prey type is sometimes accepted and sometimes rejected, i.e., partial preferences occur. Various ways in which partial preferences can be optimal are reviewed. A common feature of many of these explanations is that the standard model is too simple: states that are equivalent in it are different in a more appropriate model. Averaging over these states produces the appearance of partial preferences. A model in which the optimal action is not always chosen is explored. The idea that costly deviations from optimality should be rare is combined with a psychological choice principle to yield a general framework for suboptimal choice. When reward rate is maximized subject to the limitations of the choice principle, partial preferences are observed. When the probability of starvation is minimized these preferences depend on the animal''s reserves and the time until the end of the foraging period.

TI SEXUAL SELECTION IN WOODHOUSES TOAD (BUFO-WOODHOUSEI) .3.
   SEASONAL-VARIATION IN MALE MATING SUCCESS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male mating success in a population of Woodhouse''s toad (Bufo woodhousei) with a lek mating system was studied over a period of 5 years. Size-related mating patterns indicated by analysis of male mating success on a seasonal or yearly basis resulted from demographic changes in the size distribution of the population within a season rather than from sexual selection. Multiple regression analyses of three male traits (call rate, male size and number of nights of participation chorus activity)  revealed that only call rate explained a significant amount of variation in male mating success in 2 or 3 years. These results are discussed in the light of previous investigations of sexual selection in anurans that relied on limited observations of breeding activity within a season.

TI MALE IDENTITY AND ENCLOSURE SIZE AFFECT PATERNAL ATTENDANCE OF MEADOW
   VOLES, MICROTUS-PENNSYLVANICUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Paternal care in meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, was compared (1) for sires of the litter and non-sires, (2) in the presence and absence of a second male on the other side of wire partition, and (3) for voles housed in laboratory cages or larger enclosures. Paternal attendance was assessed by the amount of time males spent with pups, and the effect of this care on pup survival and weight gain was observed. In both small cages and large enclosures, sires spent more time with pups than  did non-sires, and the presence of a non-sire across the partition reduced that sire''s paternal attendance. In small cages fewer pups survived in the non-sire group than in the sire group, but in the enclosure pup survival was high for all groups. Males in all groups approached the nest equally often, but females attempted to prevent nest entry by non-sires. Pup weights were lower when a non-sire was on the other side of the partition. When a non-sire was present instead of, or in addition to  the sire, the amount of male attendance was reduced. This is consistent with the pattern of pregnancy disruption for this species, suggesting that pregnancy disruptions may function to limit female investment in a litter when male investment is likely to be low. Since litters with sires gained more weight than litters housed only with females, and since paternal attendance by sires remained high when voles were housed in large enclosures, functional paternal care may contribute to the  reproductive success of meadow voles.

TI EMIGRATION OF SUBADULT LIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Factors relating to whether subadult lions, Panthera leo, left or stayed in their natal pride were examined for 122 subadults living in Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. The 10 variables considered were: sex, age, age-set composition and size, relations with adult males and with adult females, food availability, competition with other pride members, mating opportunities, pride size and population density. The emigration of subadults was influenced by their age and sex, but was most highly correlated with the entry of unfamiliar adult males to the pride. Subadult males always left; subadult females became peripheral or left, unless they were able to mate with the new males. Early mating by such females did not result in early parturition, and may be a sociosexual mechanism allowing them to remain with the pride after a male take-over. If no new males entered the pride, subadults tended to remain, despite increasing aggression from pride members. They did not mate with close relatives, but some left the pride either temporarily or permanently to mate with unfamiliar partners. Pride size was not correlated with subadult emigration, but high population density appeared to facilitate it.

TI SONG, MATE CHOICE AND THE QUESTION OF KIN RECOGNITION IN A MIGRATORY
   SONGBIRD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Songs of migratory indigo buntings, Passerina cyanea, were compared among kin for birds of known family history. In one population 9.7% of the banded nestlings were seen in a later year within 2 km of their birth site. Nearly all of the males that returned to their natal area had a song unlike their father''s song. Four females mated with a male whose song was like their father''s (two of the four mated with their father). The proportion of birds whose song was like their father''s (or, for  females, mated with a male with a song like their father''s) was close to that expected by chance, based on the number of males with their father''s song in the study area. Brothers, sisters, half-siblings and three-generation kin (maternal and paternal grandfathers compared with their grandsons and with their granddaughters'' mates) had different songs. Birds within a song neighbourhood came from different natal song neighbourhoods and were not close relatives. The dispersal that accompanies long-distance seasonal migration and the disruption of family social bonds has the effect of dispersing relatives. Buntings do not appear to use songs to recognize kin in mate choice; songs are therefore not kinship markers in this species.

TI SEARCH TACTICS OF DESERT LIZARDS - HOW POLARIZED ARE THEY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The patterns of foraging movements of the teiid species Cnemidophorus tigris (western whiptail) and four iguanid species, Gambelia wislizeni (leopard lizard), Uta stansburiana (side-blotched lizard), Phrynosoma platyrhinos (desert horned lizard), and Callisaurus draconoides (zebra-tailed lizard), were investigated between 1978 and 1981. Rates and frequencies of movement while foraging, based on more than 44 000 minutes of observation of over 500 different lizards, were analysed with respect to temporal variation on yearly, seasonal and daily time scales and compared to expectations from a dichotomous view of foraging modes. The notion of polarized foraging tactics among lizards was partially supported. Among the iguanid species, only Gambelia exhibited rates of foraging movements that were not always significantly less than those of the active forager, Cnemidophorus. Nevertheless, the analyses also revealed temporal variation in the search tactics of iguanid species. Gambelia exhibited a seasonal decline in foraging movements during three out of four years. Phrynosoma, Callisaurus and Uta all exhibited seasonal declines in their foraging movements in some years, but not in others. The foraging movements of all iguanid species increased during the early-season of 1978, corresponding to a marked increase in late winter/early spring rainfall that year. Uta showed diurnal shifts in foraging movements during most years. Such diurnal variation was also  apparent in Callisaurus in some years. Despite consistent differences between Cnemidophorus and most iguanid species, the presence of temporal variability in foraging movements of iguanid lizards indicates a capacity for shifts in tactics in these species. Thus, this variability more realistically reflects a continuum of foraging than it does dichotomous strategies.

TI FEMALE CHOICE IN THE FIELD CRICKET GRYLLUS-BIMACULATUS (DEGEER)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Females of the field cricket G. bimaculatus show multiple mating. Since such a strategy is likely to incur costs such as time and energy spent in orientation to calling males or increased susceptibility to predation, it must have certain selective advantages. This study shows that multiple mating is a potential mechanism of mate choice. Females removed the spermatophores of some males before complete insemination was achieved. Females also remained with large males in order to mate a second  or third time. Since spermathecal morphology may limit last-male sperm precedence in this species, a function of multiple mating may be to dilute the sperm stored from previous matings with that of the current male, so increasing his representation in offspring production.

TI MATE ASSESSMENT IN A COCKROACH, NAUPHOETA-CINEREA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavioural effects of assessment of male dominance status on male and female courtship were investigated in the cockroach, Nauphoeta cinerea. Dominance hierarchies were established in laboratory groups of male N. cinerea; virgin females were then given the opportunity to (1) mate with a subordinate male in the presence of dominant male odours; (2) mate with a dominant male in the presence of subordinate male odours; (3) mate with a male in the presence of another male''s odour, both males lacking status; (4) mate when only a single male was present and no other male''s odour was presented. The presence of the dominant male resulted in a significant delay in the approach of a female to a subordinate male and in the response of a female to a courtship display by the subordinate male. Males that lacked status were significantly slower to inititate courtship behaviours. Copulatory time was significantly shorter for subordinate males and males without status. Information  concerning the dominance status of neighbouring males is used in asssessment of appropriate mating behaviour by males and as a possible criterion in female choice.

TI A TEST OF OPTIMALITY - EGG RECOGNITION IN THE EASTERN PHOEBE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Six types of experiments were done at 149 eastern phoebe (Sayornis phoebe) nests to investigate responses to parasitic cowbird (Molothrus ater) eggs and to partial clutch reduction, or PCR, which is the loss of some, but not all, of a bird''s clutch. Controlled experiments demonstrated that phoebes are as tolerant of cowbird eggs as of their own, regardless of context. The phoebe''s lack of responsiveness to parasitic eggs is not in accord with the expectation of adaptive behaviour, because  cowbird parasitism is very costly and phoebe and cowbird eggs are easily distinguished. In contrast, phoebes respond to PCR. They often desert a reduced clutch and invest in a new, full-sized clutch, a choice that theory predicts can be adaptive. The proximate means of assessing PCR is not by counting eggs, but by assessing the total volume or surface area of the clutch. Because cowbird eggs have more volume and surface area than phoebe eggs, phoebes are less likely to abandon if PCR involves a  reduction to two cowbird eggs than to two of their own eggs. PCR has been a selective pressure for a longer time than cowbird parasitism, although the latter is currently a much stronger pressure. Thus the contrast between the absence of responses to brood parasitism and the presence of responses to PCR suggests that the time available for the evolution of an adaptation may be at least as critical to the realization of the trait as the potential value of the adaptation.

TI THE FUNCTIONS OF STOTTING IN THOMSON GAZELLES - SOME TESTS OF THE
   PREDICTIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Stotting in Thomson''s gazelles (Gazella thomsoni) was found to have a negligible time cost in slow flights and it was normally shown in safe situations when prey were unlikely to be captured. Despite its probable energy cost and time cost during fast flights there was no evidence to show that, once a chase occurred, stotting gazelles were caught more or less often than gazelles that did not stott. Eleven hypotheses concerning the benefits of stotting were tested using a number of predictions about the stotting individual, its conspecifics and the predator (usually cheetahs), some of which were pertinent to several hypotheses. Although a number of hypotheses were supported by some of the predictions, most were refuted by one or more pieces of evidence. Only two were satisfactorily supported by all of them: stotting appears to inform the predator that it has been detected, but it does not invite or deter the predator from pursuing the gazelle. In neonate Thomson''s gazelles, stotting  probably has a different function, it informs the mother than the neonate has been disturbed and is in need of defence. In addition, mothers, whose neonates escaped capture by cheetahs stotted significantly more during the attempt than mothers whose neonates were caught. Hypotheses concerning the prey signalling its health, startling or confusing the predator; group cohesion, anti-ambush behaviour; play in young animals; warning of conspecifics; and prusuit invitation or deterrence were  dismissed by data presented here.

TI SEXUAL SELECTION, SEXUAL ISOLATION AND THE EVOLUTION OF SONG IN THE
   DROSOPHILA-REPLETA GROUP OF SPECIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The evolution of male courtship song pattern in fruit flies of the repleta group within the genus Drosophila is described. We suggest that the archetypal song was composed of two distinct components, an ''A'' song with short, regular pulse trains which occurred at the beginning of courtship, and a ''B'' song consisting of longer pulse trains of more widely spaced pulses occurring later in courtship. During evolution of the repleta group some species have lost the A song, others the B song and, in many species, the latter has become less regular and more complex in form. A songs appear to be involved primarily in species recognition and have been subject to stabilizing selection while the B songs sexually stimulate females and have therefore evolved rapidly through the action of sexual selection. Other factors influencing the evolution of song patterns have been certain physiological and energetic constraints.

TI THE VIBRATION DANCE OF THE HONEY-BEE .1. COMMUNICATION REGULATING
   FORAGING ON 2 TIME SCALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relationship between the vibration dance and foraging was investigated for the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Foraging-age workers responded to the vibration dance by moving into the area of the hive where waggle dances were concentrated and by increasing their rate of movement throughout the colony. Vibrated non-foraging-age bees did not move into the waggle dance region or exhibit increased movement in the hive. Small peaks of vibration dance activity, which tended to coincide temporally with small peaks of foraging activity, occurred with a similar frequency throughout the year. These small vibration peaks may have adjusted foraging to short-term fluctuations in food availability. In spring and summer all study hives exhibited large, morning peaks of vibration dance activity, which preceded foraging. Since there was a significant, positive slope for the regression of the magnitude of these morning vibration peaks on the mean level of waggle dancing occurring later during the  same day, morning vibration activity may have exerted a long-term ''priming'' influence on foraging behaviour. In fall and winter, compared with spring and summer, morning vibration dance peaks were smaller, less frequent and tended to coincide with, rather than to precede, foraging activity.

TI NOCTURNAL ORIENTATION BY THE ASIAN HONEY BEE, APIS-DORSATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Honey bees have been observed to forage and dance on moonlit nights, but it has never been established whether the moon serves as a reference in orienting nocuturnally active bees. The present study, of the Asian honey bee A. dorsata, suggests that although the moon''s illumination is essential for nocturnal flight, the moon itself is ignored for orienting the dances. Rather, bees probably use the sun''s position as a reference point for their dances, even though the sun is below the horizon. This ability may involve an extension of the mechanism that honey bees employ to find the sun on overcast days.

TI AN EFFECT OF MATE FERTILITY ON THE ATTRACTIVENESS AND OVIPOSITION RATES
   OF MATED DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER FEMALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mate fertility has a strong influence on the sexual receptivity of mated D. melanogaster females, but an effect of mate fertility on the attractiveness of mated females has not previously been demonstrated. The compared declines in attractiveness over the first 10 h after mating for females mated to fertile (XY) males and those mated to sterile (XO) males found a significant effect of mate fertility. A large and significant decrease in attractiveness, that is the same for both XY- and  XO-mated females, is evident during the first 4 h after mating. However, a further decline in attractiveness occurs between 4 and 6 h after mating for XY-mated females, but not until between 6 and 10 h after mating for females with sterile mates. Thus, XY-mated females are significantly less attractive than XO-mated females at 6-8 h post-mating, but not at any other time. A sharp increase in oviposition rates for both types of mated females is associated with the decline in attractiveness that occurs between 4 and 10 h after mating.

TI BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES TO VISUAL-STIMULI BY THE SNAILS

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The visual responses of 3 gastropods were studied for comparison with data previously obtained for the marsh periwinkle, Littorina irrorata. Turbo castanea, an archeogastropod inhabiting subtidal grass beds, had the lowest response thresholds for bar width (0.3.degree.-1.4.degree.) and shape reflectance (83%), and showed significant preferences in 2 binary-choice tests. Tectarius muricatus, a littorinid inhabiting hard substrate in the supratidal zone, had slightly higher response thresholds (1.4.degree.-6.5.degree.; 75%) than T. castanea, and showed a significant preference in only 1 binary-choice test. H. aspersa, a terrestrial pulmonate primarily active at night, had much higher response thresholds (14.5.degree.-24.6.degree.; 19%) than T. castanea and T. muricatus, and showed no significant preferences in binary-choice tests. Assuming that these response threshold estimates approximate actual sensory threshold, T. castanea can see slightly better than T. muricatus, and both species can see much better than H. aspersa. This conclusion coincides with expectations based on the light intensities and complexity of visual stimuli present in the habitats of these snails.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sleep in birds involves a period of eye closure interrupted by short peeks of eye-opening. These peeks allow a bird to scan the sleeping site for predators. Peeking and eye closure were recorded for 8 focal birds in flocks of 1,2,3 and 6 doves. Half these doves were high risk (predator presented before the sleeping bout) and half low risk (no predator). Individual vigilance fell with increasing flock size, and was higher in high-risk birds. Corporate vigilance increased with flock size. High-risk flocks were more vigilant than low-risk flocks. These results are discussed with reference to the costs and benefits of eye closure and peeking.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Host discrimination studies were conducted with different species of Asobara, which are larval endoparasitoids of Drosophilidae. Results indicated variable host discrimination which depended on the relatedness of the species. The closely related sibling species A. tabida (Nees) and A. rufescens (Foerster) were not only capable of intraspecific discrimination, but also avoided multiparasitism by discriminating between unparasitized host larvae and larvae previously parasitized by females of the other species. This ability to discriminate interspecifically does not seem functional as each species occupies its own microhabitat. As it was shown to be absent in less closely related Asobara sp., it is concluded that interspecific discrimination by A. tabida and A. rufescens was due to their close relationship.

TI MATERNAL RANK AND OFFSPRING RANK IN VERVET MONKEYS - AN APPRAISAL OF THE
   MECHANISMS OF RANK ACQUISITION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In 2 troops of vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) in Barbados, maternal rank predicted the outcomes of 85.5% of all dyadic aggressive interactions between juveniles and 94.1% of those interactions that occurred in the presence of the juveniles'' mothers. This suggests a strong association of maternal rank with offspring rank. Maternal interventions occurred in < 4% of juvenile interactions and their frequency was correlated with maternal rank. The social contexts in which maternal interventions occurred seem initially to suggest that their primary role is in the maintenance rather than acquisition of offspring rank. This is because offspring acquire a dependent rank immediately below their mothers from the onset. The developmental sequence of aggressive, submissive and deference behaviors of infants suggests that they do not passively accept their mothers'' rank prior to being involved in interactions themselves. The frequency of aggression by adult females  against juveniles is correlated with maternal rank and is higher for female than for male juveniles. It is directed at infants prior to the time at which the infants'' behavior is ranked. Aggression by adult females and the threat of maternal intervention, are primarily responsible for controlling the acquisition and maintenance of offspring rank in vervets.

   (CYPRINODON-PECOSENSIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Studies of the territorial breeding system of C. pecosensis at Bottomless Lakes State Park, New Mexico [USA] revealed that male reproductive mating success was affected by the topographic features of a territory and the intensity of male breeding coloration. The importance of male nuptial coloration was demonstrated by increased male reproductive success with intensity of color of the same individual males (light, 1.6 females mated/h; dark, 5.4 females mated/h). A stepwise multiple regression analysis of male reproductive success as a function of breeding substrate, nuptial color, size and agonistic behavior indicated that topographic complexity accounted for as much as 65.4% of the variance in male reproductive success and coloration accounted for at least an additional 12.7% of the variance. Male size and agonistic behavior together explained only an additional 1.8% of the variance in reproductive success, and thus were fairly unimportant as indicators of female choice. A high correlation between nuptial color and reproductive success indicates that females choose males independent of the quality of their territories.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The species Z. tuberculatus and Z. sepsoides are prevented from mating with each other by behavioral mechanisms. Male Z. sepsoides can discriminate between females of the 2 spp. by chemosensory means, and rarely court female Z. tuberculatus. Male Z. tuberculatus may also be able to distinguish between females of the 2 spp., but not infallibly. Females of both species can distinguish between the Type-2 male courtship songs of the 2 spp. Female Z. Sepsoides will not mate with males unless a conspecific Type-2 song is produced during courtship. Female Z. tuberculatus, will mate with males of Z. sepsoides if a Type-2 song is produced after a longer courtship, than if conspecific Type-2 song is produced. The onus of species recognition in encounters between males and females of the 2 spp., therefore, lies largely on Z. sepsoides. Such a mechanism of species isolation could have evolved via a stage of partial asymmetric reproductive isolation, which could originally have arisen by the effect of genetic drift occurring in 2 temporarily isolated populations of an ancestral species.

AB The development of dusk and dawn migratory behaviors was investigated in French and white grunts (Haemulon flavolineatum and H. plumieri) at St. Croix, USA Virgin Islands. Four juvenile stages were recognized: small, medium, transitional and large. Each stage differed in age, size, coloration, habitat preference, diel foraging patterns and twilight migratory behavior. Comparisons between medium (15-30 mm long, 30-50 days old) and large juveniles (40-120 mm, 80-700 days) were emphasized. Medium juveniles occurred in small, diurnally feeding groups near sea urchins in the sand halo around a reef. Group composition varied during the day. They migrated at 15 min after sunset, moving hesitantly from halo to grassbed. Migration routes remained constant over a month, but differed over 2 yr. Large juveniles fed nocturnally, formed daytime resting schools over coral heads, and migrated at 25 min after sunset. Compared with medium fish, resting site constancy was greater during a day, migration activities were significantly less variable, and migration routes remained relatively constant for 2 yr. Ontogenetic differences in constancy of daytime school locales and migration routes may result from learning, facilitated perhaps by greater overlap of age cohorts in large juveniles. Other differences in behavioral variability may result from ontogenetic development of the visual apparatus, plus stabilizing selection due to greater predation on smaller, behaviorally variable fish.

TI MATE CHOICE BY MALE STICKLEBACKS, GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Territorial male threespine sticklebakcs, G. aculeatus, were presented simultaneously within 2 gravid female stickleback dummies that differed only in degree of abdominal distention. Males directed most (approximately 60%) of their courtship behavior (zigzags and leads) to the more distended dummy. When presented with the same 2 dummies consecutively, males directed similar amounts of courtship to each. Males probably prefer the more distended females because distention indicates greater fecundity or spawning readiness.

   NEST-CHOICE IN THE THREESPINE STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a recent study (Sargent et Gebler 1980), allowed male sticklebacks were allowed to compete for a limited number of clay flowerpots as nest sites in circular wading pools. Although the males who nested in pots enjoyed higher reproductive success (Sargent et Gebler 1980), a further analysis of these data revealed the males in these 2 classes did not differ significantly with regard to territory size, total courtships, and female rejections of the nest. In the present study, for the 1st half of the experiment, flowerpots were assigned randomly to half of the males nesting in wading pools; the pots were later taken from those males who first had them and were given to the remaining males for the 2nd half of the experiment. Using paired comparisons, each male''s performance was examined with and without a flowerplot. The males received more female nest-choices, and fewer intrusions from other males, when their nests were in flowerpots; but the females appeared to engage in courtships with males independently of the males'' nest site concealment. For the 2 classes of nest site concealment, the males were not significantly heterogeneous for the number of nest-choices that they received: thus male quality did not appear to directly affect female nest-choice. Territory quality, in the form of nest site concealment, was probably the most important determinant of female nest-choice and male reproductive success in the experiments of Sargent et Gebler (1980). Females appear to minimize the risk of egg-cannibalism by spawning with those males who experience the least amount of courtship interference.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Experiments with male bowl-and-doily spiders (F. communis) on methanol-washed and unwashed female webs indicate that the courtship of males is chemically released. Parallel experiments on the webs of females of another linyphiid species and on immature F. communis webs indicate that the releaser pheromone is species-specific and that it is produced only by mature females. The pheromone that releases male courtship also functions as an attractant, changing the male''s orientation from negatively to positively geotactic. The presence or absence of a female on the test web has only a slight effect on the male''s behavior.

TI THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR BETWEEN SIBLINGS AND NON-SIBLINGS OF
   THE VOLES MICROTUS-OCHROGASTER AND MICROTUS-PENNSYLVANICUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The strength and duration of sibling relations during the juvenile period may reflect the social structure of mammal species. Two Microtus spp. with contrasting social systems, M. ochrogaster and M. pennsylvanicus, were chosen for a comparative study of juvenile social behavior. Young were observed in sibling and non-sibling dyadic encounters from the 2nd until the 7th wk of age. Social interactions consisted mainly of body-nosing of the partner, and included behaviors interpreted as investigation, socialization and settling. Only minor sex differences in body nosing scores occurred, but some ontogenetic trends were noted. When the species were compared, M. ochrogaster received higher scores for body nosing and sitting in contact, and displayed more reciprocity in their nosing, than did M. pennsylvanicus, whether siblings or non-siblings were considered. When the sibling types were compared, non-sibling dyads received higher nosing scores than did siblings in both species, but the disparity was greater in M. ochrogaster than in M. pennsylvanicus. These results are interpreted with reference to known behavioral and developmental correlates of the extended family system in naturally occurring M. ochrogaster and the less communal social system in M. pennsylvanicus.

TI CENTRAL PLACE FORAGING IN THE EASTERN CHIPMUNK, TAMIAS-STRIATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Orians and Pearson considered the optimal foraging strategies of central place foragers, animals that repeatedly return with their food at a fixed location. Some of their predictions were tested on eastern chipmunks, T. striatus. The rate of cheek pouch loading declines as the pouches fill; thus the optimal load size may vary, depending on the time required to travel between the feeding site and burrow. This travel time may also affect the choice of feeding site. A method was developed to test this. Methodological and theoretical implications of these empirical results are discussed.

TI SPECIES INTERACTIONS IN A MIXED COLONY OF COMMON TERNS (STERNA-HIRUNDO)
   AND BLACK SKIMMERS (RYNCHOPS-NIGER)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Black skimmers (R. niger) frequently nest among common terns (S. hirundo) on coastal islands from North Carolina to New York [USA]. Behavioral interactions among terns, skimmers and several potential avian predator species were quantified during the 1973 breeding season at Fisherman Island, Virginia [USA]. Common terns were dominant to skimmers, chasing and dive-attacking neighboring pairs, while skimmers rarely chased terns. Despite agonistic interactions, nesting success of both species was no different whether nearest neighbors were conspecifics or heterospecifics. Common terns chased away potential avian predators much more frequently than did skimmers. Black skimmers appear to derive a protective cover benefit from nesting among the terns. Neither nest-site limitation nor food information-sharing appear to account for the species associations.

TI MODELS OF PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT .4. SUPPRESSION - EVOLUTIONARY
   RETALIATION BY THE PARENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB ESS [evolutionarily stable strategy] were previously analyzed for the amount of parental investment (PI) that offspring are expected to solicit from their parents, given that parents acquiesce to offspring demands. Evolutionary retaliation by the parent for species where only 1 parent provides PI is discussed. Two genetic loci are envisaged: one (the conflictor locus) determines the extent of offspring solicitation, the other (the suppressor locus) determines how parents retaliate. Solicitation is assumed to carry a cost which may affect a particular offspring uniquely if time and energy are the major costs, or may affect all offspring in a brood equally if the main cost is predation risk. Two kinds of parental retaliation are possible. Parents may supply PI in proportion to offspring demands, or may ignore solicitation altogether and give a fixed PI. Analytical models of conflict in which the parent supplies PI in proportion to solicitation yield pure ESS with PI at a compromise level between parent and offspring interests. These are termed pro rata ESS. Where solicitation costs are high, an offspring wins ESS (offspring get all they want) is possible especially for forms of conflict that affect future sibs, and a parent wins ESS (parent supplies its optimum) is possible especially for conflict that affects contemporary sibs. When parental retaliation takes the form of ignoring offspring solicitation, this can lead to a parent wins ESS if costs of ignoring solicitation are negligible, but where parental insensitivity carries costs, the result is an unresolvable evolutionary chase with cycling frequencies of alleles coding for parent and offspring strategies. Pro rata ESS cannot be invaded by ignore solicitation mutants but pro rata mutants can often invade at certain stages in ignore solicitation limit cycles. The probable evolutionary end product for most species will be the pro rata ESS in which the parent supplies more PI than would be optimal in the absence of conflict, but less PI than would be an ESS for the offspring in the absence of parental retaliation. Such ESS will be characterized by solicitation costs; offspring will ask for more PI than they get. In nature highest conflict will occur when both parents sustain equally the effects of conflict, or when conflict affects contemporary rather than future sibs.

TI COMPUTING A GRAMMAR FOR SEQUENCES OF BEHAVIORAL ACTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A new procedure for finding right-linear grammars for coded, observed sequences of behavioral actions is reported. The generation of certain unobserved sequences by such grammars may be eliminated by phrasing acts together into a new unit. The process of making acts or phrases equivalent to one another is another option the investigator may use. Different phrases and equivalence sets may give rise to different grammars. Since a grammar is a theory of sequence generation, one grammar should be preferred over another (through the choice of particular phrases or equivalences) in the light of its possible interpretation. Two computer programs (RLGRAM and LANG) were written in Fortran to facilitate grammatical analysis. The use of these programs is illustrated [for the nursing behavior of a newborn seal pup Phoca vitulina].

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Quantitative study of 467 great skua and 275 Arctic skua chases of seabirds at Foula, Shetland [Great Britain, UK] showed differences in the preferred victims and rates of success of each shua species. Spatial segregation of preferred victims reduces the possibility of interspecific competition. Several factors influence the outcome of chases. The duration of chase, the speed of reaction of the victim and the method of evasion employed are important factors. These are strongly influenced by local visibility and the height of the victim above the sea at the start of the chase. Variations in the success rates of chases between colonies are explained in terms of these relationships.

TI INFLUENCE OF POINTED REGIONS ON SHAPE PREFERENCE OF HONEY BEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Honey bees were rewarded for visits to a black stripe mounted on a vertical plane. At intervals, tests were carried out in which the bees made unrewarded choices between the training shape and various test shapes. Pointed shapes are chosen more frequently than very similar shapes lacking points. Analysis of behavior during a choice test showed that the bees visited the acute points of pointed shapes much more frequently than other areas of the shape. This suggests that the acutely pointed region itself is very attractive to the bee. The differences in behavior towards different regions of the same shape casts doubt upon the possibility of using global parameters to describe the bees'' classification of shape.

AB The effects of excreted and bladder urine of group- and singly-caged female house mice (Mus musculus) on sexual maturation of young female mice caged alone or in groups of 8 were studied. Puberty was determined by vaginal smears. A maturation-delaying pheromone was present in bladder urine of all female mice and excreted urine of group-caged females, but not in excreted urine from singly-caged females. Test mice treated with bladder urine homogenized with urethras from singly-caged females matured at the same age as controls. Apparently the urethras or associated glands of singly-caged females produce a substance which deactivates the maturation-delaying pheromone contained in bladder urine.

Measurements are presented which suggest that on nights with low cloud or fog migrants might obtain useful information about the nature of the ground or water surface from sounds characteristic of particular environments. Breeding choruses of Hyla crucifer and H. versicolor are loud enough to be audible to migrating birds up to at least 1 km from their source, both vertically and horizontally, provided that no large obstacles intervene. During May in SE New York State [USA] sound pressure levels (A weighting) at altitudes of 200-965 m and slant ranges from the frogs 225-1020 m varied from 28-52 dB SPL.

TI HEARING RECOGNITION OF LAMB BY ITS MOTHER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Merino ewes (23) were tested for their ability to discriminate between their own and an alien lamb at a distance. Most of them (19 of 23) were able to recognize their own young at a distance of 10 m. Eighteen of the 23 mothers, selected at random, were tested with recorded bleatings of lambs. They displayed a significant preference for the bleating of their own lambs. These results suggest that hearing plays an important role in the distance recognition of the lamb by its mother.

TI JUMP-YIP DISPLAY OF BLACK-TAILED PRAIRIE DOG CYNOMYS-LUDOVICIANUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A frequent behavior pattern of C. ludovicianus is a formalized upward leap with a sharp vocalization: the ''jump-yip'' display. It is performed in very diverse circumstances by individuals who have been startled, are being cautious, or have been involved with territorial defense. They behave in various ways, here divided into 8 categories, but in all cases are less likely to flee after jump-yipping than immediately before. Virtually any act in its repertoire other than escape may then follow, although attack is rare. Providing information about the relative probabilities of escape and alternative acts appears to be very important in the complex interactions of this unusually social ground squirrel.

TI EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL SELECTION FOR SLOW MATING IN DROSOPHILA SIMULANS
   .I. BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A slow-mating line of Drosophila simulans was produced by artificial selection, in which the behavior of males was not affected but in which there were marked effects upon females. The great majority of the females of this line (SA) failed to become receptive on the 2nd day from eclosion, as did normal flies. The development of receptivity followed the activation of the corpus allatum-corpus cardiacum complex after eclosion. SA females had normal ovarian growth, and their corpus allatum complex when implanted into normal hosts was capable of inducing precocious receptivity. The failure of SA to become receptive is not due to endocrine disturbances, but to some change in the neural target organs upon which the hormone acts.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Strains of chickens produced by bidirectional selection for social dominance ability were investigated to elucidate possible physiological mechanisms responsible for their altered conflict behavior. Differences in pair contest behavior between selected strain capons and females stimulated by equivalent doses of androgen paralleled differences between high- and low-strain intact males. Strain differences in conflict behavior frequency, in severity of encounters and in dominance ability were interpreted to be primarily associated with changes in physiological responsiveness to social stimuli rather than changes in endogenous androgen production.

AB Bees readily learn the locations of consistently yielding food sources and their associated odor(s). Experienced bees require only the scent(s) of a familiar source for efficient recruitment to that location. Experienced bees which attend dancers are recruited to the source at which they had earlier success and not necessarily to locations indicated by the dance information. The conditioned responses of experienced bees can account for much of a colony''s routine exploitation of crop sources.

TI EVIDENCE FOR USE OF VISION IN DIURNAL ORIENTATION OF BAT MYOTIS
   AUSTRORIPARIUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Normal, ear-plugged, and blindfolded bats (Myotis austroriparius) were released during the dat at stations 500 ft. south and 750 ft. east of the home cave. Thirty-two (33.3%) of 96 controls returned to the main or secondary entrances of the cave as compared to 5 (12.5%) of 40 ear-plugged and none of 45 eye-covered individuals. Blindfolded bats showed more disorientation in flight behavior than either ear-plugged or control animals. More bats returned from the south, the direction in which most of the colony went during the evening flight 2 nights before the experiment, suggesting that familiarity with the local terrain may be a factor in homing success. The results appear to provide further evidence that vision in micro-chiropteran bats is better developed than generally supposed and that at least under certain conditions visual cues play a significant role in orientation.

AB The law of heterogeneous summation asserts that a whole is equal to the sum of its parts. Gestalt psychology asserts that a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. There is evidence to show that in lower animals, at least, Gestalt''s, evolve from "heterogeneous summations", in both phylogenetic and ontogenetic evolution. Two experiments are performed which show that this kind of shift occurs in the development of human infants. The results shed some light on the origins of Gestalt perception.

LA English
DT Article
AB Sexual responses of rams were recorded following individual exposure to an artificially induced estrous ewe until 20 min. had passed with no mounts (criterion of sexual exhaustion). Following "sexual exhaustion," exposing the rams to a different, not recently mated ewe resulted in reinitiation of mating at or near original levels. Exposing the rams to the same or a different, recently mated ewe resulted in little further mating. Returning the same ewe at various time intervals postexhaustion indicated that sexual responsiveness increased rapidly in a few hours; however, a complete recovery could not be demonstrated even after 2 weeks. Electroejaculation had no effect upon subsequent mating performance.

TI WABBLER-LETHAL MOUSE - A STUDY IN DEVELOPMENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A single-gene substitution in the wabbler-lethal (wl) mouse, known to demyelinate the central nervous system beginning at about 14 days of age, was studied for its effects on the developmental features of behavior, morphology and physiology. Nearly all aspects of development from birth through day 25 were retarded for the homozygous form (wl wl). Retardation included open field ("arena") activity, rises on the hind limbs, climbing ability, eye opening, ability to clasp the hind limbs, defecation and body weight. All developmental indices appeared to be regulated by a common substrate. Body weight was depressed from that of the normal on the day of birth and arena activity was lower by day 10 postpartum, suggesting that the antecedents of the demyelination are operative long before the neuropathology is evident. Intense forms of environmental stimulation which doubled mortality (e.g., wheel rotation) did not alter the penetrance of the mutant gene but did delay the onset of overt wabbling and hind limb paralysis by about 1 to over 2 days. Several double-recessive animals about 20 to 25 days of age convulsed and died immediately following behavioral testing. A 20% reduction in blood glucose found in the mutant form under resting conditions suggests that convulsions and death were due to "hypoglycemic shock.".

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Settled and arrival distances were recorded. Individuals tend to have specific partners with which they clump for up to 40 mins in each hour. Birds tend to clump more rapidly if they are sexually attracted, and nuptial plumaged males tend to avoid clumping with other similarly plumaged birds. Diurnal cluming seems to be causally independent of temperature. Allopreening is described, and this could not be increased by "flouring" the head of the clumping partner. In clumping encounters, the dumper is usually either pecked and/or allopreened, and allopreening seems to divert mildly aggressive responses which occur when 2 birds are very close to each other. Besides this conciliatory function, the act of being allopreened may be a form of social reward, serving to strengthen the bonds between the members of a flock of "contact" species.

AB Three experiments were designed to test Hess''s notion that strength of imprinting is related to effort expended by the chick during initial following. Comparisons were made between imprinting scores by chicks trained under different conditions as follows: chick following moving object; chick confined in plastic box moving behind a moving surrogate; chick confined behind screen and exposed to moving surrogate; chick and surrogate both stationary. Data from all 3 experiments indicated strongly that chicks trained under the 1st set of conditions showed superior imprinting. Those trained with stationary surrogates showed lowest imprinting scores. The results were taken as agreeing with, though not confirming Hess''s "Law of Effort", since they do not demonstrate conclusively the greater importance of efferent as opposed to afferent variables.

AB Long-term individual-based studies of parental investment are pivotal to understanding the costs and benefits associated with defensive strategies under stressful conditions. In the context of avian research, limited literature exists on longitudinal changes in antipredator behaviour during incubation and potential selection pressures on a specific trait. We studied the response of common goldeneye, Bucephala clangula, to disturbance, mimicking a predation threat in a nestbox population from 1984 to 2021. From a total of 652 captured females, 516 were recaptured as breeders 2e15 times over the study period. During the nest-monitoring visits, female behaviour was classified as 'shy' (flushing before the human observer reached the nestbox, or they flew into the net placed over the nest hole), 'average' (leaving the nest when the observer scratched the nestbox wall, or they showed inconsistent flush patterns such as once behaving shy and once bold in the same year), or 'bold' (leaving the nest once physically touched or they did not leave at all). Our results provide evidence of plasticity of antipredator behaviour, since the probability of exhibiting a bold reaction to a perceived predation danger increased with age, whereas shy individuals became less common. On the other hand, we found a high level of repeatability of behavioural response across individuals. The findings reveal the coexistence of plastic and personality traits among common goldeneye females. Moreover, there was a positive linear interaction between age and clutch size on boldness, but only for clutches below the parasitism threshold (fewer than 13 eggs). Interestingly, hatching success was not related to behaviour, suggesting no direct selection pressure on antipredator behaviour and that depending on age/residual reproductive value, either shy or bold types are favoured to benefit the lifetime reproductive success of individuals.

AB Many animals inhabit nests that protect them from adverse environments. However, the effects of living in a built or found structure are not limited to protection: the physical space can shape and organize behaviour, particularly in self-organized collective systems. In addition, the geometry of nest space may not be under the animal's control, raising the question whether animals can compensate for the effects that unexpected or suboptimal geometries may have. Here we examine how the shape of a nest cavity affects spatial organization of colonies in the ant Temnothorax rugatulus, a species that adapted to nest cavities of unmodifiable internal dimensions, since they inhabit rock crevices with rigid walls. We show that the emerging spatial relationships of workers, brood, queens and young alates, as well as their relationships and distances to significant points in the nest, are all significantly influenced by nest shape, with the brood distributions most affected. However, we also found that the size of worker spatial fidelity zones, i.e. the areas in the nest that individual workers occupy and that may be key regulators of division of labour, are overall not affected by nest shape. These findings indicate that ants may actively regulate which areas of a nest they occupy and that they may compensate for effects of nest architecture constraints. Physical properties of nests can thus influence the organization of ant colonies, highlighting the need to explore spatial constraints as a direct influence on the organization, movement and communication of evolved or engineered self-organized systems.

AB Growing research on the function of female birdsong now allows for identification of large-scale patterns emerging in the published literature. We conducted a review that analysed female birdsong function studies to characterize the literature and research approaches in this field. We examined when, where and how researchers study female birdsong function and then quantified which functions for female song were most often supported by authors. Our data set included studies published between 1900 and 2022 that concentrated on singing female birds and either investigated or addressed functions of solo female song directly. The number of female song studies published per year has increased rapidly in recent decades, with the majority of the work focused on North/Central American species, followed by Australian and South American species. Most research studies used natural observation techniques, about half used playback and only 21% used other manipulations. In 67% of the studies analysed, female song was reported to be used in defence of a territory, 43% of studies reported intrasexual competition/ aggression and 45% reported intrapair communication. Mate attraction and parent-offspring communication were the song functions least often supported and least often tested by authors. Most authors identified multiple contexts in which female song functioned in each study species. Outcomes match the demonstrated multifunctionality of male birdsong. In contrast, females apparently use song for mate attraction much less than male birds do. Surprisingly, less than 10% of papers directly linked female song behaviour to reproductive success, a connection providing critical support for ultimate explanations of function. It is evident that scientific interest in female birdsong function is on the rise. Our review identified a need for future research to include African and Asian avian species and studies that comprehensively test the fitness correlates of female birdsong function.

AB Describing patterns in activity and behaviour of animals as they move through their environment helps to reveal fundamental aspects of their ecology and identify key habitat requirements. Nursery areas are used by many shark species and play an important role in maintaining the viability of populations. Although shark movements within nursery areas have been well studied, far less is known about how space use correlates with activity levels and specific behaviour. In the present study, we used combined accelerometer-acoustic transmitter tag packages to investigate fine-scale space use, activity and behavioural patterns of nursery-bound lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris. First, we constructed an ethogram to categorize specific behaviours from accelerometer data collected from seven sharks (97 -122 cm total length) that were caught, tagged and observed in captivity for 3-6 days. Second, we conducted field trials with 19 sharks (78-169 cm total length), each tagged and actively tracked during 3 -5 deployment days. We then used baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys to investigate potential overlap between shark foraging effort and prey distributions. Accelerometer and tracking data showed that the tidal phase significantly affected space use, activity and behaviour. Sharks used nearshore areas during the high tide periods where resting increased and activity levels were reduced. On falling tides, sharks moved farther from the shoreline and increased overall activity. Foraging effort peaked at low tide periods and foraging events overlapped with areas of disproportionately high preferred prey abundance. Ontogenetic patterns were also found in which larger sharks generally occupied larger home ranges, spent more time in areas farther offshore, rested less and foraged more than smaller individuals. These findings represent novel insights into nursery habitat use and behavioural trade-offs in lemon sharks and support more informed management for this threatened species.

AB Restocking initiatives have the potential to help conserve populations of threatened species, and there is a growing interest in applying this approach to marine fish. Sciaena umbra and Dentex dentex are two coastal fish species that inhabit the Mediterranean Sea and are categorized as 'Vulnerable' according to the IUCN Red List.This study investigated the performance of S. umbra and D. dentex hatchery-reared juveniles feeding on live prey. We evaluated whether 6 days of training and body size had an impact on feeding performance and behaviour. In both species, we found that training had a positive effect on fish feeding performance by (1) significantly increasing mean number of prey eaten, (2) decreasing the latencies before first attack and first ingestion and (3) increasing attack efficiency. In addition, there was a significant increase in the number of S. umbra individuals that ingested at least one prey item over the 6 training days. The percentage of fish that ingested at least one prey item did not, however, increase significantly for D. dentex individuals over this period; instead juveniles either (1) attempted to eat novel prey, succeeded and displayed an improvement of their feeding efficiency through training, or (2) did not forage or eat over the 6 training days. The high number of individuals exhibiting the second response could be linked to several factors, including fear, personality or the type of prey used in this study. In S. umbra, individuals from the [50-60[ mm total length size class outperformed other size classes. Our findings highlight differences in feeding behaviour between the two species and the positive impacts of training on feeding performance. Our results should be taken into account when developing release protocols for potential restocking programmes. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Animals require a nutritionally balanced diet to support growth and reproduction. The geometric framework for nutrition asserts that animals actively balance their nutritional intake to maintain physiological homeostasis and optimize task performance to increase fitness. Both solitary and social animals will adjust their relative consumption of nutritionally distinct resources to meet their intake target ratio. Honey bees are eusocial insects whose primary source of macronutrients comes from floral pollen, including the essential fatty acids, omega-6 (linoleic acid) and omega-3 (alpha-linolenic acid). These must be actively balanced, as an unbalanced diet skewed towards a high omega-6:3 ratio reduces life span, reduces the size of the hypopharyngeal glands that produce jelly to feed larvae and impairs performance in cognition tests. As honey bees show a division of labour by age, we hypothesized that consuming an unbalanced diet would impact the timing of task transitions and nursing activity. To test this, we fed 1-day-old adult workers either a balanced (omega-6:3 ratio = 1) or unbalanced (omega-6:3 ratio = 5) diet for 7 days, after which they were released into a common-garden hive. Workers were tagged with barcodes and filmed continuously for 6 days, allowing analysis of nursing behaviour of individuals. The unbalanced diet delayed the onset of nursing, reduced the rate of nursing visits and affected the relative attention devoted between 3-day-old and 4-day-old larvae. We discuss these findings in the context of division of labour and nurse-larvae interactions, and identify novel avenues for further research linking fitness-related behaviours to nutritional balancing.

AB Strong, affiliative relationships are important across social mammals, and in many species, relationships between female kin form the basis of group life. Relationships are expected to be weaker in cases where females disperse or do not cooperatively defend resources. Mountain gorillas, Gorilla beringei beringei , seem to support this, as females can emigrate multiple times throughout their life and do not jointly defend the abundant vegetation they feed on. Unsurprisingly, mountain gorillas have been reported to form variable or weak relationships with other females and seemingly prioritize relationships with adult males. But prior studies may have misinterpreted relationships due to a focus on grooming and understandable limitations of small sample sizes and short study periods. Here, we examine proximity and grooming between 47 adult female mountain gorillas in five groups over 5-13 years. We analyse proximity data (2 m, 5 m) and grooming relationships between 366 individual dyads to determine (1) whether proximity and grooming relationships are preferential and (2) whether they endure across time. Most females formed at least one preferential 2 m and 5 m proximity relationship (43 of 47), which both lasted a mean of 2.1 years. Additionally, 3.6% of dyads ( N 1 / 4 13/366) formed enduring 2 m proximity preferences that exceeded 4 years, with the longest lasting at least 12 years. Maternal kin had the most enduring proximity and grooming relationships, although grooming was rare overall. The enduring proximity relationships between some female gorillas in our sample are similar in length to those of female yellow baboons, Papio cynocephalus , and male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes , which are considered social bonds. Mountain gorillas provide a system in which factors influencing bonds can be better understood, and our study highlights a need to refine definitions of social bonds while potentially reassessing their evolutionary function.

AB Animals often moderate behaviours based on environmental and social cues to enhance their chances of survival and reproductive success. This requires reliable cues that reflect changes in ambient conditions. Environmental pollutants can increase communication costs and distort the accuracy of received information, leading to negative effects on the outcome of behavioural adjustments. Consequently, selection may reduce behavioural plasticity to avoid errors or promote more prudent decision making when certain cues become unreliable. In aquatic ecosystems, water turbidity shows high levels of natural variation, but human activities amplify its magnitude and extent by increasing algae and suspended solids in the water. Here, we investigated how elevated levels of water turbidity affected mating decisions made by female guppies in a laboratory setting. Guppies are a widespread species with a broad tolerance of polluted environments, and females rely heavily on visual cues when making mate choice decisions. We manipulated turbidity by adding suspended solids to water and tested how this affected female preference for males with more orange coloration. We found that females spent more time near males with a greater area of orange coloration in low turbidity water, but that this preference disappeared in both the mid and high turbidity water treatments. Moreover, female preferences were repeatable in low turbidity water and high turbidity water but not in mid turbidity water. Together, our results suggest that water turbidity impairs the ability of females to discern male coloration and affects the consistency of mate preferences. This could have consequences for the evolution of male coloration in turbid waters. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Even though a large amount of research has focused on testing cognitive traits of dogs, we still know almost nothing about whether these traits associate with dogs' daily behaviour outside the test situation. For these tests to have applied value it would be beneficial that they reflect dogs' behaviour in a broader sense rather than simply during the test situation. Our aim was to deepen our understanding of what cognitive traits can tell us about dogs' behaviour in their daily lives with their owners. We used two validated owner-completed questionnaires, the Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) and the Dog Impulsivity Assessment Scale (DIAS), to determine daily behavioural traits of dogs. A cognitive test battery was used to measure cognitive traits. We used linear mixed models for analysis (N 1/4 987) and accounted for control variables such as sex, breed, age and training level of dogs. We found that high inhibitory control in the Cylinder Test was positively associated with trainability and negatively associated with impulsivity (DIAS). A shorter latency to solve the V-detour task was positively associated with management problems, and dogs that were unsuccessful at the Logical Reasoning task were rated as slower at learning new tasks. Human-directed behaviour during the Unsolvable Task was associated positively with trainability and stranger-directed fear, and negatively with impulsivity (DIAS) and management problems. Our findings suggest that cognitive tests can help us to predict and explain dogs' behaviour, personality and behaviour problems. These results provide important information on dogs' behaviour both in cognitive tests and in their daily lives with their owners. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Wolbachia are intracellular symbiotic bacteria widely distributed in arthropods. Many studies have focused on the effects of Wolbachia infection on host reproduction; however, the effects of Wolbachia on the neurobehaviour of hosts are largely unknown, despite their distribution in the host brain. As a virulent strain of Wolbachia, wMelPop can rapidly proliferate in adult tissues, including the brain, implying the potential to impact neurobehaviour in insect hosts. In this study, using the conditioning and testing protocol with sugar reward, we found that despite being virulent, wMelPop infection improves both short- and long-term memory in Drosophila melanogaster. By RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we compared the transcription profiles of 4-6-day-old fly heads with and without wMelPop and identified 1284 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as having a significant and at least a two-fold change in expression, of which 675 genes were upregulated and 609 were downregulated in the presence of wMelPop. Surprisingly, except for involvement in proteolysis and immune responses, many of the DEGs were associated with reproductive behaviour, especially the regulation of female postmating responses. When compared with RNA-seq data from 4-6-day-old wMel-infected fly heads, we found that both groups shared 421 DEGs. Fifteen genes were selected for quantitative RT-PCR. Twelve genes showed the same changes as RNA-seq analyses. These results suggest that wMelPop infection in Drosophila might enhance the insect host's memory by altering host gene expressions in the head. As wMelPop has been demonstrated to be the strongest Dengue blocking strain known, the behavioural and ecological consequences of wMelPop infection in the insect hosts may be of great importance in controlling insectborne diseases and agricultural pests. Our data also provide a significant panel of candidate genes to help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Wolbachia-induced neurobehavioural alterations in arthropod hosts.

AB A pair bond is a long-term social relationship between two unrelated individuals of the opposite sex that persists outside of the breeding season. The strength of a pair bond is often linked to behavioural and physiological components, such as behavioural synchrony and hormonal status, and can be measured across timescales, contexts and species. Pair mates that spend more time in proximity and that engage in the same activities are often more strongly bonded than pair mates that behave independently. Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine whether the amount of time that canid pair mates spend in proximity provides an index for the strength of their pair bond and whether pair bonds are dynamic or static across time and other factors. Coyotes exhibit pair-bonding behaviour in the form of territorial defence and biparental care and therefore make an excellent model for our objectives. We fitted captive coyote pair mates with proximity-tracking collars and collected faecal samples to quantify synchronous behaviour and hormonal status. We measured pair mate proximity across reproductive seasons (breeding versus nonbreeding), pair bond tenures (newly paired, 1-2 years paired, 5 & thorn; years paired) and times of day (dawn, day, dusk, night). We found that dusk was an important temporal window for quantifying pair mate proximity because dusk was the time when pair mate proximity significantly differed according to reproductive season or pair bond tenure. We detected marginally higher faecal progesterone levels in female coyotes during the breeding season, relative to the nonbreeding season, but we did not find differences across other hormone metabolites assessed. Female faecal progesterone metabolite levels were the only hormone significantly correlated with proximity behaviour outcomes. These results suggest that the amount of time that coyote pair mates spend in proximity can provide an index for the strength of their pair bond and that these pair bonds are dynamic and can be influenced by internal and external factors.

AB Prosocial punishment is a process of enforcement that promotes a partner's cooperation in a sustained relationship and is an important mechanism in the evolution of cooperative behaviour. The 'pay-to-stay' hypothesis predicts that in cooperatively breeding animals, dominant breeders punish idle subordinates (helpers) that assist breeders in offspring care to promote their cooperation. However, limited evidence demonstrates that subordinates increase helping effort in response to breeder aggression; therefore, whether breeder aggression functions as punishment remains unclear. In the laboratory, we observed idle helpers of the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus savoryi and whether dominant breeders punished them. Breeders increased their aggression towards subordinates that were prevented from helping by 2 h removal from the tank, and attacked helpers subsequently increased territorial defence depending on breeder aggression level, suggesting that breeder aggression functions as punishment. No breeder aggression was observed when helpers performed pre-emptive helping behaviour prior to dominant breeder attacks. Notably, dominant breeders punished even their offspring when idle, suggesting that the helping behaviours of relatives may be facilitated by parental punishment. Our study shows that dominant group members can use punishment to elicit help from subordinates, even in nonhuman animals. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals express consistent individual differences in some behaviours, termed animal personality, but behaviours can also vary considerably within individuals, within minutes or hours, due to environmental stimuli. Consistent among-individual variation is often assumed to be mediated by hormonal mechanisms. Hormones are also involved in flexible and fast responses towards environmental stimuli. Even though basic mechanisms by which hormones regulate behaviours are known, much of the quantitative patterns underlying hormone-behaviour interactions within and among individuals remain unclear. Here, we conducted two experiments to investigate the immediate, short-term effects of experimentally elevated cortisol titres on well-known animal personality traits (experiment 1) and their potential longterm effects (experiment 2) in the medium-sized cavy, Cavia aperea. Therefore, we tested how personality traits related to stress coping, novelty seeking and social behaviour react within hours to elevated cortisol. In experiment 2, we tested whether a 3-week elevation of cortisol affects the same personality traits after cessation of the hormone treatment. We investigated effects on the mean levels of behaviours, that is, the personality type, the temporal consistency (i.e. repeatability) and among-individual correlations of traits. In experiment 1, we found cortisol led to more aggressive behaviour and more passive stress coping while other traits were unaffected. In experiment 2, we found no long-term effects. Both measured hormones, cortisol and testosterone, showed correlations with several personality traits; these correlations, however, were unaffected by the cortisol treatment. Animals receiving the cortisol treatment showed higher repeatability for one stress-coping trait and lower repeatability for testosterone concentration. Interestingly, the sexes differed in only few mean trait expressions but showed different correlation structures across traits. Taken together, our data indicate that personality traits in adult individuals are very consistent and only react with short-term fluctuations to internal hormonal signals. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB How do primates learn to communicate? An influential, but largely untested model proposes that pri-mates go through a pruning process, guided by social learning, during which they increasingly restrict alarm calling from initially broad ranges of animals to a few dangerous predators. To test this model, we conducted an experiment with free-ranging sooty mangabeys, Cercocebus atys atys, in which we sys-tematically exposed different age groups to models of dangerous vipers and nonvenomous colubrid snakes. We found that young juveniles perceived all snakes as dangerous and indiscriminately alarm called, although they had the longest response latencies. In contrast, adults showed antipredator be-haviours faster to vipers than colubrids but never alarm called to the latter, unlike juveniles. Finally, all young and some older juveniles alternated their gaze between the snake models and other group members, suggesting they engaged in social referencing, that is, gazing at others to assess their reactions to external events. Our study provides a systematic, empirical demonstration that, in nonhuman pri-mates, predator learning starts with overgeneralization, followed by subsequent refinement via social learning during the juvenile phase.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Animal personality has wide-reaching impacts on the individual fitness and life history traits of many wild vertebrates. Recent work has highlighted personality not only as a driver of sample bias during wildlife population monitoring, but also as a potential underlying mechanism influencing the success of population translocations and invasive species control. Mustelids are the largest family in the order Carnivora and are of particular interest to conservation, with members on the IUCN red list of threatened species and the list of the world's most disruptive invasive species. Despite the widespread implications of personality for wildlife research, conservation and management, there exists little to no personality work in the mustelid literature. To address this gap, we used the stoat, Mustela erminea, as a model species to evaluate three assays to quantify personality in a wild-caught mustelid tested under captive conditions. Our intent is to highlight the importance of personality for wildlife conservation and man-agement, and to provide robust assays for mustelid researchers and managers to modify and utilize.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, is one of the most damaging and widespread invasive ant species worldwide. A thorough understanding of their learning ability could be critical to improving control efforts. We conducted a systematic investigation of olfactory learning and route learning in Argentine ants. The ants showed rapid route learning after only one visit, and rapid odour learning and a longlasting long-term memory after only one exposure to food cues. Food flavour information was transferred efficiently between ants in the nest, driving preference: naive ants housed with ants fed on flavoured food showed a strong preference for that odour after 24 h. Overall, L. humile were found to be outstanding learners. This, coupled with efficient intranidal information transfer and strong pheromonal recruitment, may help explain their ability to discover and then dominate resources. However, these strengths could potentially be used against them, by exploiting learning and information transfer to improve control efforts. & COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Human language is characterized by the integration of multiple signal modalities, including speech, facial and gestural signals. While language likely has deep evolutionary roots that are shared with some of our closest living relatives, studies of great ape communication have largely focused on each modality separately, thus hindering insights into the origins of its multimodal nature. Studying when multimodal signals emerge during great ape ontogeny can inform about both the proximate and ultimate mecha-nisms underlying their communication systems, shedding light on potential evolutionary continuity between humans and other apes. To this end, the current study investigated developmental patterns of multimodal signal production by 28 semiwild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, ranging in age from infancy to early adolescence. We examined the production of facial expressions, gestures and vocalizations across a range of behavioural contexts, both when produced separately and as part of multimodal signal combinations (henceforth multimodal). Overall, we found that while unimodal signals were produced consistently more often than multimodal combinations across all ages and contexts, the frequency of multimodal combinations increased significantly in older individuals and most within the aggression and play contexts, where the costs of signalling ambiguity may be higher. Furthermore, older individuals were more likely to produce a multimodal than a unimodal signal and, again, especially in aggressive contexts. Variation in production of individual signal modalities across ages and contexts are also pre-sented and discussed. Overall, evidence that multimodality increases with age in chimpanzees is consistent with patterns of developing communicative complexity in human infancy, revealing apparent evolutionary continuity. Findings from this study contribute novel insights into the evolution and development of multimodality and highlight the importance of adopting a multimodal approach in the comparative study of primate communication.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB The high costs of predation and the opportunity costs associated with predator avoidance are likely to select for flexibility in the development of antipredator responses based on local socioecological conditions. As group size is hypothesized to vary across populations as a function of predation risk, the development of antipredator behaviours throughout ontogeny may be influenced by the size of an individual's social group. Here, we explore the development of alarm call responses in wild vervet monkeys living at the Samara Game Reserve, South Africa. Vervet monkeys at this site live in relatively large social groups, and adult responses to alarms have previously shown less uniformity than in other sites where group sizes are smaller. We presented monkeys playback recordings of terrestrial alarm calls produced by individuals of different age-sex classes. We then videorecorded and scored the responses of receivers along an ordinal maturity scale. We used a mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression model within a Bayesian framework to explore how response intensity is affected by the age-sex of the caller, and the age of receivers. Our analysis showed that younger monkeys (<2 years old) exhibit strong evasive responses to call stimuli, regardless of the age-sex class of the caller. The intensity of these responses decreases with age, with responses to nonalarm calls decreasing earlier in development than responses to alarm calls. Adult responses to alarm calls in this population are as likely to be characterized by a general increase in vigilance as they are to consist of an evasive response. We suggest that responses in younger individuals at Samara are mediated by generalized startle responses to loud, plosive noises. Development of more specific responses throughout ontogeny is likely to be dependent on learning from adult models, whose milder responses reflect local socioecological conditions specific to Samara.

AB Ideal free distribution theory attempts to predict the distribution of well-informed ('ideal') and unconstrained ('free') foragers in space based on adaptive individual decisions. When individuals differ in competitive ability, a whole array of equilibrium distributions is possible, and it is unclear which of these distributions are most likely. In the first part of our study, we show that strong competitors have an intrinsically stronger preference for highly productive habitat patches than poor competitors. This leads to an equilibrium distribution where the average competitive ability on a patch is strongly correlated with the productivity of the patch. In the second part of our study, we consider what happens if differences in competitive ability are heritable and, hence, subject to natural selection. Under constant environmental conditions, selection eliminates such differences: a single strategy prevails that optimally balances the costs and benefits associated with competitive ability. If the productivity of patches changes during the lifetime of individuals, the spatial assortment of competitors of equal competitive ability gives poor competitors a systematic advantage in times of environmental change, while good competitors benefit from equilibrium conditions. Using evolutionary individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that environmental change may then lead to the diversification of competitive ability. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB When becoming parents, female mammals undergo extensive physiological and behavioural changes that facilitate the onset of parental care. These include increased attraction to sensory stimuli from neonates, mediated by hormonal and neural shifts accompanying pregnancy and parturition. In some biparental species, new fathers also become more attracted to neonates; however, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. We examined the effects of becoming a father on males' behavioural responses to two sensory stimuli from unrelated pups -odour and vocalizations -in the biparental California mouse. First-time fathers and age-matched virgin males were exposed for 10 min to a pup-related stimulus (pup odour, pup vocalizations or both) and, simultaneously, to a control stimulus (unscented cotton and white noise) in a 1 x 1 m open-field arena. Fathers spent significantly more time in proximity to and in contact with pup-related stimuli, regardless of sensory modality, than control stimuli, while virgins showed no differences in their responses to pup-related and control stimuli. Neither fathers nor virgins responded differentially to pup odours, pup vocalizations or the combination of these stimuli; however, males exposed simultaneously to pup odours and vocalizations spent less time near the arena walls compared to males in all other stimulus conditions and spent more time in the empty corners of the arena compared to males presented with only pup odour. These results suggest that fathers are attracted to pup stimuli but do not show differential attraction to specific sensory modalities. Virgin males, in contrast, do not demonstrate either attraction or aversion to these stimuli. Our findings will help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the onset of parental behaviour in new fathers, with particular emphasis on sensory plasticity.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Sensory cues like sight and sound are used to recognize threats (e.g. predators) and elicit escape responses in prey. Similarly, these cues might be used to detect an approaching wildfire. We tested whether the western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis, responds to the sound of fire as a threat. We predicted that lizards living in burned areas would be more sensitive to the sound of fire than lizards in adjacent and urban areas, where fire suppression could have induced relaxed selection on fire responsiveness. We compared the behaviours of lizards following an experimental playback where we broadcast the sound of fire along with other control sounds (a predator, a common nonpredatory bird and a novel nonpredatory bird). We conducted our playbacks in 2019 in recently burned areas (using the survivors from the 2018 Woolsey Fire, southern California, U.S.A.), unburned adjacent areas and urban areas. We found that in burned areas, lizards responded more to the sound of fire than all three controls, but in urban areas, they responded more to both the sound of a predator and the sound of fire. Our results suggest that lizard responses to fire sounds are greater in an area that has recently experienced a wildfire than in an unburned area, and that urban areas create a complex evolutionary landscape that also increased antipredator behaviour for other biologically relevant stimuli.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Dear enemy and nasty neighbour are both phenomena that depend on the ability to discriminate between neighbours and strangers. Although both mechanisms reduce costs in territorial maintenance, their occurrence has been poorly investigated in duetting animals. In this study, we sought to test neighbour-stranger discrimination via cues in duets by the rufous hornero, Furnarius rufus (Furnariidae), a suboscine bird with high territorial fidelity and in which both sexes cooperate to defend the territory against competitors. Specifically, we assessed whether territorial owner aggression (1) is higher against neighbours or strangers (dear enemy or nasty neighbour effects) in the breeding and nonbreeding seasons and (2) whether aggression varies according to the intruder's position in the territory (centre versus periphery), the distance between neighbouring territories and the number of neighbours. Owners were more tolerant of neighbours' duets than of strangers' duets in the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Furthermore, females and males demonstrated similar social discrimination abilities. The number of neighbours significantly influenced only the flight latency of the owner, and aggression against competitors was more intense at the territory centre. Aggressiveness was higher in territories whose neighbouring territorial boundaries were farther apart. Our results demonstrate that rufous hornero pairs can discriminate duets based on familiarity with the sound producers, with stranger pairs being more threatening than neighbouring pairs to resource possession throughout the year. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal neighbour-stranger discrimination in a duetting species. Future evaluations may reveal whether more sophisticated recognition mechanisms, such as individual recognition, are also present in this as well as in other duetting animals.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Acoustic signals degrade and attenuate as they propagate through the environment, thus transmitting information with lower efficiency. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis (AAH) states that selection should shape the vocalizations of a species to maximize transmission through their habitat. A specific prediction of the AAH is that vocalizations will transmit better when emitted in their native habitat versus non-native habitats. We tested this prediction using vocalizations of three mongoose species that dwell in structurally different habitats: banded mongooses, Mungos mungo, dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, and meerkats, Suricata suricatta. Representative vocalizations of the three species were broadcast and rerecorded in each habitat at six distances from the source. Rerecorded vocalizations were compared to nondegraded calls through spectrogram correlation. Using generalized linear mixed models, we then quantified the differences in transmission fidelity of each species' vocalizations. Overall, we found partial support for the AAH within the mongoose family: habitat type strongly affected sound transmission, but depending on the species, vocalizations did not always transmit best in their native habitat, suggesting various degrees of acoustic adaptation. Vegetation cover within habitat type was also found to have a significant influence on the transmission properties of vocalizations. In addition, we found evidence that by changing their behaviour, either by producing vocalizations at different amplitudes or by choosing a specific calling location, mongooses can reduce sound degradation and attenuation over distance, thereby enhancing their communication efficiency. Our work highlights how habitat features may be key determinants of vocalization structure in mongooses, and is generalizable to other species living in similar conditions. It also suggests that, given a species and habitat, other selective pressures might prevail and limit acoustic adaptation in animal communication systems. Finally, our study provides in-sights into how mammals can adjust their vocal behaviour to compensate for environmental constraints on the transmission of their vocalizations.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Understanding the physiological factors that contribute to variation in female mate preference can provide valuable insights into factors that can influence the strength of sexual selection as well as the costs and benefits of being choosy. We asked whether the hormone cortisol could be involved in regulating variation in female mate preference in the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus. On average, females prefer to mate with larger males from the reproductive tactic that courts females (courters) as compared to the tactic that uses coercive mating behaviours (sneakers), but the strength of this preference varies with sexual experience and female size. We measured cortisol concentrations from muscle tissue across females after measuring their mate preferences between courter and sneaker males, taking into consideration female size, sexual experience and lineage (courter or sneaker fathers/grandfathers). We found that females with stronger preferences for courter males had lower cortisol concentrations, suggesting cortisol may be involved in regulating variation in preference. The relationship between cortisol and preference was not influenced by female's size, sexual experience or lineage. Our results suggest that cortisol may not be involved in a female's interest in mating, as cortisol was not related to the total time a female spent with males. Finally, intraspecific variation in cortisol was best explained by a female's lineage, suggesting that further study of known differences between the male tactics (i.e. growth rates, cognition) may provide insights into adaptive variation in female mate preferences. Further investigation of the role of cortisol in relation to female mate preferences has the potential to provide new insights into both adaptive variation and environmental influences on the strength of sexual selection.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   PREFERENCE
AB Whenever resources are limited and indivisible, fighting will evolve as a means to resolve ownership. Among such resources are mates, and individuals (usually males) of many species compete agonistically with rivals in order to gain access to potential mates. However, securing access is not necessarily enough to guarantee a mating or, if a mating is obtained, to guarantee that it is effective for securing reproductive success. Thus, in addition to fighting, individuals participate in a wealth of behaviours to maximize their reproductive success, from courtship to sperm competition to mate guarding. In recent years, the striking parallels between fighting and mating behaviour have become a subject of discussion. In particular, insights have been drawn from the predictions of contest theory to help us understand the use of repetitive signalling in courtship. Here, we take this discussion further, highlighting similarities between fighting and mating in the use of dynamic repeated behaviours, which function to (1) advertise quality and (2) convince or coerce an individual to relinquish the contested resource (gametes in terms of mating). We focus specifically on a performance trait of emerging interest in the field of animal contests, skill. We identify behaviours used throughout the mating process in which skill is likely to be of importance for securing success, and highlight key questions for future study.

AB Dispersal is an inseparable feature of animal life and a major determinant of species distributions and range dynamics. However, the role of the genetic architecture of dispersal behaviour, and hence the potential for its evolution in range-expanding species, is poorly understood. Here, we aimed to determine the heritability of dispersal behaviour for an invasive dwarf spider, Mermessus trilobatus, which has undergone rapid range expansion in Europe in the last few decades. Our results showed that spider dispersal traits were repeatable for the parental generation and heritable through both dam and sire. Behaviours were similarly heritable for female and male offspring. Interestingly, offspring of highly dispersive dams and sires exhibited almost three times higher dispersal propensity than offspring of at least one low-dispersive parent. The substantially high dispersal behaviour of the offspring of strictly highly vagile dams and sires indicates its recessive inheritance in this species. Recessive inheritance could favour invasiveness by facilitating high dispersal in inbred founder populations at the invasion front and returning to nonexaggerated mobility soon after an increase in genetic diversity.

AB Social mimicry may lead to convergent evolution when interactions with conspecific and heterospecific individuals drive evolution towards similar phenotypes in different species. Several social mimicry hypotheses accounting for convergence in communication signals exist. However, assessments of how similar species are given the visual system of signal receptors have been ostensibly missing from tests of such hypotheses. We used plumage reflectance measurements and models of avian colour discrimination to evaluate the efficacy of visual deception and the plausibility of mimicry hypotheses accounting for plumage convergence among six species of passerine birds in the flycatcher family (Tyrannidae) with strikingly similar plumage. We rejected the interspecific social dominance mimicry hypothesis as an explanation for the similarity between one putative model species and putative mimics because deception seems unlikely given their visual system. However, plumage similarity was consistent with a role for selective pressures exerted by predators because dorsal coloration of putative model and mimic species was indistinguishable by visually oriented raptors. Experiments and behavioural observations are necessary to better characterize social interactions and to test predictions of alternative mimicry hypotheses proposed to account for convergence.

AB Several hypotheses explain how sensory, anatomical and physiological constraints drive fruit preference in frugivores. Optimal diet theory (ODT) states that frugivores make decisions based on the energy contained in food. In contrast, geometry of nutrition (GN) states that animals balance their macronutrient intake instead, opting for rough energy. The defence trade-off hypothesis (DTH) assumes a negative relationship between secondary compounds and fruit preference. Finally, the size-matching hypothesis (SMH) states that frugivores are more attracted to fruits that are easier to handle and consume. We tested these four hypotheses by offering paired fruit species to three fruit-eating animal species in captivity that either chew fruit in the beak or mouth ('masher': 1 bird species, 1 bat species) or swallow whole fruits ('gulper': 1 bird species), from which we built a ranking of fruit preference. We then explored the importance of 13 fruit traits in explaining fruit preference. The masher bird was the only species whose fruit preference pattern corresponded with GN. Fruit preference of the masher and gulper bird species supported DTH and SMH, while fruit preference by the bat species was not related to any analysed trait. More than one single rule governs fruit preference in different frugivore species. Fruit preferences of functionally different frugivore species are affected by particular fruit traits, which they either select or avoid. The search for specific macronutrients, while avoiding toxicity in fruits matching the anatomical limitations of frugivores, could lead to complementary foraging choices. Variability between seed disperser species in their search for easily manageable fruits allows achieving a complementary fruit diet, with preferred and avoided traits. It can be an important driver of fruit trait diversity in fleshy-fruited plant assemblages.

AB Egg rejection behaviour is a host strategy adopted by birds against brood parasitism. The optimal acceptance threshold hypothesis predicts that, when the frequency or risk of parasitism increases, host acceptance thresholds should become more restrictive. Here, we investigated egg rejection behaviour in the Daurian redstart, a cavity-nesting host of the common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus. In a Daurian redstart population located in the northern cold-temperate zone of China where redstarts have two peaks of egg laying during the breeding season, cuckoos can only parasitize redstart nests during the second egglaying peak due to their late arrival on the breeding grounds. We artificially simulated brood parasitism by introducing a model cuckoo egg into a redstart nest during both egg-laying peaks to test the prediction that redstarts should reject eggs at a greater rate during the second than the first egg-laying peak. In accordance with the optimal acceptance threshold hypothesis, Daurian redstarts showed significantly higher egg rejection rates during the second egg-laying peak. This result indicates that temporal variation in egg rejection behaviour by Daurian redstarts may be an adaptive response to seasonal change in risk of cuckoo parasitism. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that the egg rejection rate of a host population increases with increasing risk of cuckoo parasitism within a breeding seas.

AB Despite growing attention to the ecological and evolutionary importance of consistent individual differences in behaviour (animal personality), long-term field studies quantifying factors associated with behavioural repeatability remain rare. Here, we studied animal personalities over an 8-year period, representing 6 study years, in a wild population of the long-lived sleepy lizard, Tiliqua rugosa. Using Bayesian generalized linear mixed models for 170 unique individuals and a total of 379 lizard-years, we (1) considered the effects of a suite of predictors - particularly lizard sex, mass and tick counts - on lizard aggression and boldness (2) assessed repeatability (i.e. consistent differences among individuals), of these behaviours over different timescales and between lizard sexes and (3) evaluated the correlation, or behavioural syndrome, between aggression and boldness. We found that males were marginally more aggressive and bolder than females, mass had no significant effect and tick loads exhibited a positive relationship with aggression and boldness. For repeatability, we found that even with the long timescales considered in this study, aggression and boldness were both repeatable - across the entire data set (-0.4 and -0.3, respectively) using all lizards, as well as among years (-0.4 and -0.4, respectively) using lizards observed in multiple years (93 for aggression, 73 for boldness). Repeatability did not differ substantially between the sexes. We found no syndrome between aggression and boldness - despite a weak positive correlation in multivariate mixed models, the 95% credible interval for this correlation included zero. Our results are notable because they demonstrate that wild animals may exhibit consistent personality differences in ecologically relevant behaviours over extended periods even in the face of substantial temporal variation in ecological and social factors, a fact that has likely ecological and evolutionary consequences.

AB Various avian species give mobbing calls that draw conspecific and heterospecific individuals to react against the potential predator. According to the 'attract the mightier' hypothesis, when predators appear, prey will produce mobbing calls to attract superior predators to repel or kill the primary predator. To test this hypothesis, we broadcast calls from light-vented bulbuls, Pycnonotus sinensis (the prey) in the vicinity of a taxidermy model of a collared scops owl, Otus lettia (the primary predator). Three call types were used: the typical call (TC, the control treatment), a mobbing call to a collared scops owl (the MtO treatment) and a mobbing call to a crested goshawk, Accipiter trivirgatus (the superior predator; the MtH treatment). Our results showed that crested goshawks appeared and attacked the taxidermy model during the MtO treatment, but not during the control or MtH treatment. The difference between the MtO and other treatments was significant. Our results, therefore, provide strong evidence for the hypothesis that mobbing calls to primary predators can successfully attract superior predators to harm primary predators.

AB The act of mating increases predation risk by hindering an animal's ability to detect and escape from predators efficiently. Here, a novel issue of how alternative reproductive tactics differently influence these abilities was examined in the triplefin blenny, Enneapterygius etheostoma. A slow predator approach was presented to males with different mating tactics (territorial and sneaking) and mating states (mating and nonmating), totalling four combinations. Predator-male distance when males became wary was independent of tactics. The distance was shorter for mating males than nonmating males, but only when males faced away from the stimulus. Thus, mating state diminished the capacity for detecting danger similarly for both tactics. Predator-male distance when males initiated the escape was well predicted by mating state in sneakers, with shorter distances for mating individuals; however, the same was not obvious in territorial males. Consequently, sneakers escaped later than territorial males during mating, but both males escaped at a similar distance from the predator when in a nonmating state. Instead, mating territorial males returned to the spawning sites earlier than nonmating males. Overall, sneakers made bold escape decisions, whereas territorial males became risk prone when returning to the spawning sites. In conclusion, sneaking males pay a predation cost when mating.

AB During aggression, animals signal their physical abilities to deter opponents from fighting. Competitors that have a coevolved system of communication can resolve the outcome of a fight without paying the cost of engaging in potentially injurious fighting. Invasive species complicate the dynamics of competition, because such species may not have a coevolved system of communication. For example, many species of crayfish have invaded freshwater ecosystems, where they compete with species never encountered before. We studied the traits used to escalate aggression within and between two species of invasive crayfish in Arizona, Procambarus clarkii and Faxonius virilis. Through staged encounters, we found that individuals of both species escalated aggression according to their relative claw size. Furthermore, claw size (instead of claw strength) determined the outcome of interactions that escalated to physical combat. Despite P. clarkii and F. virilis presumably not having a coevolved system of communication, claw size predicted the outcome of interspecific aggression. In crayfish and other species that have invasive potential, future investigations into intraspecific versus interspecific communication dynamics are warranted as they may shed light on the successes and failures of past and present species introductions.

AB Captive breeding is a conservation strategy that often results in behavioural changes in animals born and reared in captivity. Culturally transmitted behaviours, such as learned vocal signals, are particularly prone to the effects of captive breeding because captive animals have limited opportunities to learn these behaviours from wild animals. Changes in learned behaviour could affect the success of reintroduction programmes once captive animals are released into the wild. We tested for vocal divergence of learned calls in Puerto Rican parrots, Amazona vittata. We recorded parrots from two captive populations and two wild populations, representing all extant populations of this species. We also recorded parrots that had been translocated between populations and evaluated changes in their vocal signals over time. Fine-scale acoustic analysis revealed vocal divergence in all four populations. The geographical variation in vocal signals evolved over a time span of 10-40 years, demonstrating that cultural traits can evolve rapidly in managed parrot populations. Parrots that were translocated between populations adopted the new vocal signals. Vocal divergence in this species likely resulted from a combination of historical rearing practices, cultural drift and geographical separation. Managers should consider strategies to facilitate the acquisition of foreign vocal signals prior to release. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A recent paper by Chen et al. (2019, Science, 363 (6423), 166-167) found that female budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus, show a preference for males that are successful problem solvers. Is this result sufficient to conclude that mate choice influences the evolution of cognitive abilities? Here, we consider what we currently know about the relationship between problem solving and cognition. We argue that it is premature to conclude, based on these findings, that cognitive abilities have evolved in part through sexual selection by female choice.

AB Inference by exclusion, or the ability to select a correct course of action by systematically excluding other potential alternatives, is a form of logical inference that allows individuals to solve problems without complete information. Current comparative research shows that several bird, mammal and primate species can find hidden food through inference by exclusion. Yet there is also wide variation in how successful different species are as well as the kinds of sensory information they can use to do so. An important question is therefore why some species are better at engaging in logical inference than others. Here, we investigate the evolution of logical reasoning abilities by comparing strepsirrhine primate species that vary in dietary ecology: frugivorous ruffed lemurs (Varecia spp.) and folivorous Coquerel's sifakas, Propithecus coquereli. Across two studies, we examined their abilities to locate food using direct information versus inference from exclusion and using both visual and auditory information. In study 1, we assessed whether these lemurs could make inferences when full visual and auditory information about the two potential locations of food were provided. In study 2, we then compared their ability to make direct inferences versus inferences by exclusion in both the visual and auditory domains. We found that these lemur species can use visual information to find food, but that only ruffed lemurs were also able to use auditory cues, mirroring differences in the complexity of their wild ecology. We further found that, unlike many anthropoid species tested to date, these strepsirrhine species failed to make inferences by exclusion. These results highlight the importance of natural history in understanding the evolution of logical inference and help reconstruct the deeper phylogeny of primate cognition.

AB Inhibitory control is the ability to resist performing a prepotent, but ultimately incorrect, behaviour in situations that demand restraint. Inhibitory control is linked to brain size and intelligence in humans and animals, but it is unclear just how it evolves. Inhibitory control is thought to be particularly important in complex social environments where demands can shift frequently based on the social context and the identities or behaviours of other individuals in a group. Indeed, the social intelligence hypothesis suggests that the demands of living in complex social groups led to the evolution of sophisticated cognition. Here, we tested inhibitory control in wild spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, whose large social groups are structured by linear dominance hierarchies. We tested inhibitory control using the cylinder test, which requires subjects to inhibit going straight for a food reward. In support of our predictions, hyaenas living in larger groups had greater inhibitory control. In particular, the size of the cohort in which young hyaenas grew up, rather than the size of adult groups, had the strongest effect. In addition, the effect of group size was significantly stronger for low-ranking hyaenas, which must frequently inhibit both feeding and aggression in the presence of higher-ranking hyaenas. Contrary to our predictions, adult male hyaenas, which always occupy very low rank positions as adults, did not have better inhibitory control than adult females. This suggests that inhibition is not a canalized trait, but instead may be a flexible one such that its development is influenced by early life social environments.

AB Across diverse societies, group members benefit from the cooperative maintenance of a shared territory (a public good). How such public goods are maintained has received extensive interest, yet individual contributions to cooperative territory defence remain poorly understood. Recent theory predicts that, in groups with social hierarchies, privileged individuals will contribute most to competition with rival groups as they benefit most from defence of the territory. Here, we investigated whether dominant individuals contribute more to territory defence in a group-territorial bird in which dominants monopolize within-group reproduction: the white-browed sparrow-weaver, Plocepasser mahali. Using simulated territorial intrusions, we demonstrate that dominants contributed significantly more than subordinates to territory defence. We also found that individual contributions were adjusted according to threat: males of both social classes significantly and similarly increased their contributions to defence in response to a high threat (playback of an unfamiliar pair's duet, rather than that of a neighbouring pair), which was associated with a stronger collective response by the group. Thus, while dominants contributed most as predicted by the asymmetry in benefits, subordinates did increase contributions when they were needed most (in small groups and under greater threat). Contributions by subordinates when needed most also highlights that dominants could still benefit substantially from tolerating the presence of subordinates despite their overall lower contributions. Our results show that public goods can be maintained despite unequal contributions and highlight the potential importance of context-dependent behavioural flexibility in mitigating collective action problems.

AB Many hosts of obligate brood parasitic birds invest more in parasitic nestlings than they do in their own young. The shiny cowbird, Molothrus bonariensis, a generalist parasite, is fed at a higher proportion than its host nestmates when it is reared in nests of a smaller-bodied host, the house wren, Troglodytes aedon. We test two hypotheses that could account for this differential allocation of food by host parents. The signal exaggeration hypothesis states that cowbird chicks have visual and/or acoustic begging signals that elicit preferential feeding. The size-advantage hypothesis states that hosts preferentially feed large chicks and/or that larger chicks outcompete host chicks in a scramble competition for food. To gain insight into the relative importance of size versus species-specific signals on food allocation by house wrens, we performed audio and video recordings in nests with experimental broods of (1) a 2-day-old cowbird chick and a 2-day-old wren chick (different species, different size), (2) a 2-day-old cowbird chick and an 8-day-old wren chick (different species, same size) and (3) a 2-day-old house wren and an 8-day-old house wren (same species, different size). When cowbirds shared the nest with a same-size wren chick, both chicks received food in equal proportion. In contrast, larger chicks (both cowbirds and wrens) paired with small wren nestmates always received a higher food share. Cowbird begging behaviour and call traits differed from house wrens, but these differences did not always coincide with increased food. We conclude that, at least when cowbird nestlings are young (2 days old), their relatively large size accounts for the larger share of food they receive from house wren hosts, rather than some quality of their begging signal.

AB In species in which males signal competitive ability through secondary sexual traits, males with different levels of trait expression may adopt different reproductive tactics to maximize their reproductive success. In fission-fusion social systems, the most dominant males often roam widely in search of females in oestrus, and thus exhibit different patterns of sociability from subordinate males that utilize alternative reproductive tactics. Giraffes, Giraffa camelopardalis, are rare among mammals in that they are sexually dimorphic in colour, and colour is hypothesized to function as a signal of males' social status by displaying their competitive ability. Here we analysed the coat colour and sociability of 66 wild male giraffes over 12 years at Etosha National Park in Namibia to test two premises underlying this hypothesis. First, we found that males did not all darken at the same rate or to the same degree, and colour variation increased with age. This suggests that colour is not solely an age-based trait but could be a secondary sexual trait. We then showed a distinct difference in the sociability of both young and pale males compared to darker males. Both younger and paler old males tended to be more gregarious while darker males were more solitary. This is consistent with a system where darker, more dominant males roam looking for females in oestrus. Younger or subordinate males may delay roaming or use an alternative tactic, such as remaining in groups with females to gain copulations when a more dominant male is not present. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that male giraffe coat colour functions as a signal of social status through competitive ability, but deeper study into movement patterns and the costs and benefits associated with darker colours is required.

AB Foraging bees expend considerable time and energy handling flowers that are morphologically complex (with concealed food rewards) while simple flowers (with readily available rewards) bloom simultaneously in their foraging environment. Previous studies have investigated the consequences of floral morphology for both foragers and plants, often treating 'complex' and 'simple' morphologies as dichotomous traits. How pollinators' foraging choices and success vary along a floral complexity gradient has received less attention. Here we investigated, using real flowers of increasing morphological complexity, how complex flowers are chosen and handled by naive and experienced bumblebees when presented along with simple ones. Intact flowers of Tecoma x 'Orange Jubilee' (Bignoniaceae), Antirrhinum majus (Plantaginaceae) and Lupinus pilosus (Fabaceae) represented a gradient of increasing morphological complexity. We manipulated some flowers of each species to look simple with a readily accessible food reward, while keeping their colour and odour unchanged. Bombus terrestris workers were given four simple and four complex flowers of a single species with equal rewards in choice assays in a flight room. Sixty per cent of naive foragers chose a complex flower on their first visit to all three flower species arrays. Experienced bees visited complex flower types of all three species but had lower feeding success and longer handling times on the more complex species. Thus, the bees' foraging efficiency on the complex option decreased with increasing complexity of the flowers, while individual variation in feeding success on the complex option was increased. These results suggest that inexperienced foragers and unsuccessful feeding attempts increasingly contribute to floral pollination along the morphological complexity gradient.

AB Understanding animal emotions is an important scientific and ethical question but assessing emotional valence is still considered challenging. As the observation of lateralization (hemispheric asymmetries in structure and/or function) can provide insight into the underlying processes of the cognitive, physiological and behavioural components of emotions, it is a promising approach for studying them. The emotional valence hypothesis states that positive emotions are mostly processed by the left hemisphere, while negative emotions are mostly processed by the right hemisphere. Support for this hypothesis is still not conclusive; therefore, our study tested it in the context of visual laterality for viewing positive or negative emotionally conditioned stimuli. Ninety male piglets were either positively (food-reward) or negatively (mild punishment) conditioned to an object. Afterwards, the object was presented without the reinforcer under three different treatments: patch on the left or right eye (reducing input to the contralateral hemisphere) or patch between the eyes (the control). Monocular viewing had no clear effects on the negatively conditioned subjects. In contrast, in the positively conditioned group, covering the right eye caused a longer interruption of vocalization, a longer latency to touch the object, a shorter duration of exploring the arena and an increased vagal activity compared to the control. This suggests that reduced processing in the left hemisphere leads to heightened attention that is accompanied by a general orienting response, possibly resulting from a reduced positive appraisal. These findings therefore partially support the emotional valence hypothesis and suggest an important role of the left hemisphere in the quick recognition of a positive stimulus. This study demonstrated that investigating the lateralized processing of emotions can provide insight into the mechanisms of positive appraisal in animals. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB In altricial species, young rely on parental care and brain maturation mainly occurs after birth. In precocial species, young are born at a more advanced developmental stage in need of less or no parental care and brain development is mostly completed at the time of birth. We therefore predicted early maturation of learning ability in precocial species. We used a series of visual discrimination and reversal stages to investigate the ability of the precocial eastern blue-tongue lizard, Tiliqua scincoides scincoides, a long-lived Australian lizard species with slow-developing young, to respond to changes in stimulus relevance and test for behavioural flexibility. To test whether age affects learning in this species, we compared juveniles (23-56 days) with adults (sexually mature, at least 2 years). In accordance with our expectations, adults and juveniles performed similarly well in all stages, suggesting that juveniles of this precocial species learn at adult levels from an early age. Both age classes performed well during reversals showing good behavioural flexibility. This is the first study in lizards to directly compare juvenile and adult behavioural flexibility. Importantly, we demonstrate that precocial lizards can begin life with an advanced cognitive ability already in place.

AB Many ant species use trails to connect important resources. In addition, some ants actively clear obstacles from their trails. Although trail clearing is thought to be beneficial in decreasing travel time, the physical process of clearing requires an investment of time and energy. Given that trail clearing is a decentralized process, how do colonies decide when to invest in clearing? In this study, we examined trail clearing in the Australian meat ant, using artificial semipermeable barriers mimicking grass. We tested the hypothesis that investment in clearing was influenced by the abundance and physical toughness of obstacles and that the selection of which grass blade to cut was a nonrandom process that decreases travel distance. We found that low abundance/low toughness treatments experienced the greatest amount of clearing and high abundance/high toughness the least. Although ants did not clear an optimally efficient trail, the results of our percolation analysis support the inference that the ants strategically deployed clearing, taking multiple factors into account when deciding to invest in this strategy. The resultant clearing patterns provided shorter travel routes for foraging ants than would be expected by the random removal of obstacles. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB American crows, Corvus brachyrhynchos, often loudly vocalize when gathered around a food source. Because doing so would attract unwanted attention from predators and competitors, animals that have congregated around food are only expected to vocalize if the benefits (e.g. recruiting or announcing themselves to allies, deterring competitors, warning of danger, begging for a meal, appeasing a dominant) outweigh these costs. Here we demonstrate that wild crows change the quality of their calls depending on the amount of food present. The crows near a large food windfall gave shorter calls compared to their vocalizations in food's absence, and playback of these short calls only prompted a mild aggressive response from listening crows. In contrast, the calls given before the appearance of food were longer, and their playback elicited behaviours from the listening crows associated with aggression and territory defence. These findings suggest that crows avoid giving territorial calls near an exploitable food resource and vocalize for other reasons. Taken together, this study provides insights on how the caller's current context can shift the costs and benefits of vocalizing. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB While studies of animal behaviour have performed a key role in informing conservation management of threatened species, antipredator behaviours are rarely considered in conservation decision making. This study assessed the impact of the translocation of an endemic New Zealand bird to a predator-free ecosanctuary on its antipredator behaviour. We compared antipredator responses of South Island robins, Petroica australis australis, found inside the ecosanctuary with those of robins inhabiting local predator-dense forests, using taxidermy models of a rat, Rattus norvegicus, and stoat, Mustela erminea. Although mammalian predators are relatively novel in New Zealand, some endemic species such as South Island robins recognize them and show antipredator behaviours. We determined the rate of loss of behaviours after release into the ecosanctuary since founders were translocated from predator-dense environments. Robins inhabiting the ecosanctuary exhibited lower intensities of antipredator behaviour towards the model rat than robins in predator-dense areas within at least 3 years after translocation, a shorter period than previously suggested. A recent stoat incursion in the sanctuary provided the opportunity to discern whether robins regained predator-specific antipredator behaviours or displayed heightened generic vigilance to all novel predators. The more intense antipredator responses recorded towards the model stoat than the model rat within the ecosanctuary indicated that the robins had regained their behaviours towards stoats but had not generalized the predatory features of the stoat to the rat. Our study raises concerns regarding the viability of sanctuary populations as sources for future translocations into areas with predators. We recommend antipredator training to improve species survival. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent work in animal cognition has focused on how animals respond to new or changing environments. Although many species are currently in decline, other species are thriving in human-altered habitats by taking advantage of new resources and opportunities associated with anthropogenic disturbance. Yet, as a result, these same species are often in conflict with humans and treated as a nuisance. Therefore, cognitive abilities such as innovation and behavioural flexibility may, paradoxically, lead to the demise of especially adaptive individuals. Here we review what is known about the cognition of 'nuisance' species and 'problem' individuals to shed light on the struggles of coexistence with humans along disturbed landscapes. We take an in-depth look at several cognitive abilities that are hypothesized to be of critical importance for species that are successfully utilizing human-altered environments, including neophilia, boldness, categorization, innovation, memory, learning, social learning and behavioural flexibility, and examine evidence that these cognitive abilities may also bring animals into conflict with humans. We also highlight some examples of species that may be using cognitive mechanisms to change their behaviour to avoid conflict with humans. We then discuss the role of animal cognition in current mitigation strategies that have been developed to address human-wildlife conflict. Additionally, we consider the role that human behaviour and perception of animals might play in either worsening or lessening conflict with wildlife. Finally, we propose some directions for future research and suggest that empirical investigation of 'nuisance' animal cognition could reveal the cognitive mechanisms underlying adaptation to anthropogenic change as well as help mitigate human-wildlife conflict.

AB Reproductive traits are often tightly linked to variations in the social environment. In animals with separate sexes, producing male or female offspring results in different fitness gains depending on population structure. In simultaneous hermaphrodites, allocating a given proportion of resources to the two sexes results in fitness gains that depend on mating opportunities, and extremely plastic hermaphrodites may have a selective advantage. To test to what extent hermaphrodites have flexible and reversible sex allocation at the individual level, we exposed hermaphroditic Ophryotrocha diadema worms (an obligatorily nonselfing polychaete, with low numbers of aflagellate, immotile sperm and 'pseudocopulation') to weekly changes in actual or simulated mating opportunities and mate competition (controlling for density effects). We found that worms rapidly switched from high investment in the female function (eggs and courting) to high investment in the male function (aggressive behaviour) with increasing mating opportunities. Simulated mate competition and competition over the male role triggered similar variations in egg production (i.e. worms laid fewer eggs), indicating that these worms preferred to mate in the male role. These results highlight the key role of behaviour in the study of reproductive investment in hermaphrodites and the importance of plasticity in sex allocation (including precopulatory behaviours) in hermaphrodites as a way to compete for the male role and to keep hermaphroditism stable in fluctuating environments.

AB Many animals use alarm calls in intraspecific communication to warn conspecifics of a predator's presence or to elicit coordinated group responses. However, alarm calls may also be aimed directly at the predator to discourage further pursuit. These 'pursuit-deterrent' signals are particularly important in the presence of ambush predators that rely on stealth to hunt prey. Here, we conducted playback experiments over a 16-month period on radiocollared ocelots, Leopardus pardalis, in Peru using audio stimuli of titi monkey (Callicebus toppini) and saki monkey (Pithecia rylandsi) alarm calls, with nonalarm loud calls as controls. We predicted that, if titi and saki alarm calls function as deterrent signals, then ocelots would move away from the sound source and leave the area following exposure to alarms but not following controls. We tracked ocelots via radiotelemetry for 30 min prior to and 30 min following experiments. At 15 min intervals we noted subject location, whether the cat was stationary or moving towards, away from or parallel to the playback area (calculated using a deflection angle) and distance travelled. Results showed a significantly different pattern in response movement between playback trials; ocelots moved away from the sound source in the majority of alarm trials but remained stationary/hidden or moved in a variety of directions following control trials. Ocelots also moved significantly farther following exposure to alarm trials than following exposure to controls. We conclude that ocelots can distinguish alarm calls from other loud calls and are deterred by alarm-calling monkeys. This is the first study to use playbacks on wild predators to test the pursuit-deterrent function of primate alarm calls. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Loud, long distance calls serve varied functions across animal species including marking territory, attracting mates and signalling one's identity. Here, we examined the types of sender- and context-specific information encoded in the howls of captive timber wolves, Canis lupus. We analysed 913 howls from nine individuals across three packs and investigated whether howl structure varied consistently as a function of phenotypic factors (age class, sex, pack and identity of the caller) in addition to the context in which the call was produced: specifically, whether the call was produced in a 'spontaneous' context just after sunrise or was 'elicited' by the absence of a group member. Calls were correctly classified by individual identity and production context, but not by any other factors. Principal components analyses indicated that individual differences were primarily associated with frequency-based measures, whereas acoustic variation between production contexts was associated with a variety of frequency-, intensity- and energy-based measures. Recognition of individual differences in vocalizations is likely to be important for navigating social relationships in wolves and further work is required to determine which life history factors may shape these individual differences. Differences resulting from production context are suggestive that these howl variants may serve different functions. The extent to which these individual and contextual differences are understood by receivers remains an open question. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Imperfect mimicry presents a paradox of incomplete adaptation - intuitively, closer resemblance should improve performance. Receiver psychology can often explain why mimetic signals do not always evolve to match those of their models. Here, we explored the influence of a pervasive and powerful cognitive bias where associative learning depends upon an asymmetric interaction between the cue (stimulus) and consequence (reinforcer), such as in rats, which will associate light and tone with shock, and taste with nausea, but not the converse. Can such biases alter selection for mimicry? We designed an artificial mimicry system where bees foraged on artificial flowers, so that colours could be switched between rewarding or aversive. We found that when the colour blue was paired with a sucrose reward, other cues were ignored, but not when blue was paired with aversive compounds. We also tested the hypothesis that costs of errors affect how receivers sample imperfect mimics. However, costs of errors did not affect bee visits to imperfect mimics in our study. We propose a novel hypothesis for imperfect mimicry, in which the pairing between specific cues and reinforcers allows an imperfect mimic to resemble multiple models simultaneously. Generally, our results emphasize the importance of receiver psychology for the evolution of signal complexity and specificity. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The degree of three-dimensional movement exhibited by animals depends, in part, on their style of locomotion. For example, surface-bound animals such as humans are always in contact with the ground and, consequently, their travel in the vertical dimension is largely dictated by the topography of the terrain. In contrast, nonsurface-bound (flying and swimming) animals can move equally in all three dimensions. Research from the last 20 years has indicated that many animals learn and remember information about the vertical and horizontal dimensions with different degrees of accuracy, and that this may be influenced by their style of locomotion; however, there has been no overview to determine whether these differences follow general patterns and there have been few attempts to explain the reasons behind them. The aims of this article are twofold. First, we review the literature on vertical and horizontal navigation, comparing the relative accuracy of these processes in surface-bound and nonsurface-bound animals, and critically appraising the key contributing factors. Second, we hope to establish a framework to help direct researchers interested in the effects of locomotory style on navigation to areas of the field where data are lacking or where there have been contradictory findings that need to be resolved. We suggest that as there are currently few studies investigating three-dimensional navigation, the field would benefit from more studies in a larger variety of species, in particular flying and swimming species that nest and forage on the ground or in the benthic zone and arboreal surface-bound animals that must regularly move in three dimensions through the canopy. This will enable us to determine whether real differences in spatial learning exist between animals exhibiting different styles of locomotion and, if differences do exist, allow us to establish general principles that can explain these differences in spatial learning between species.

AB The environment can have a considerable impact on behaviour. The social environment is predicted to be a particularly important driver of behavioural variation and evolution through the indirect genetic effects that arise whenever individuals interact with conspecifics. We used male Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, to examine the effects of changes in the social environment (recorded acoustic sexual signals of other males) on the expression and consistency of boldness, activity and exploration, and their between-individual covariation. Switching from a silent environment to being exposed to male acoustic sexual signals resulted in crickets becoming less bold, active and explorative. Switching from an acoustic to a silent environment resulted in increased boldness and activity. We also looked at the effects of changes in the nonsocial environment via a physical disturbance that mimicked the presence of a potential predator (mechanical shaking). The effects of physical disturbance (and changes thereof) on behaviour were far less pronounced than the effects of changes in the social environment. Neither the repeatability of nor correlations between behaviours were affected by changes in physical disturbance. Only the average level of exploration was affected significantly when crickets were moved from an undisturbed to a disturbed environment, with crickets becoming less explorative. Although changes in the social and the nonsocial environment affected the repeatability of and correlations between some of the behaviours measured, changes in the social environment had the greater effect. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of our findings and how they relate to our current understanding of social and nonsocial environmental effects on behaviour.

AB Rapid human population growth and increasing habitat fragmentation lead to more frequent direct encounters between humans and animals. Consequently, numerous habitats will become less suitable for some species due to an increase in perceived risk of predation. Studies show that different species vary greatly in their tolerance to human disturbance, but these findings are typically only based on flight initiation distance (FID, the distance at which animals flee when approached by a potential predator including a human). The aim of this study was to broaden the general view of escape behaviour by including distance fled (DF) in the analyses. We measured FID and DF in 699 birds belonging to 17 species in Estonian urban and rural settlements. We calculated the relationships between two types of escape decisions and behavioural, environmental and morphological parameters. There was a positive relationship between FID and DF for heavier species, but not for lighter species suggesting mass-dependent differences in the cost of escape. Flock size and starting distance in rural habitats were important predictors of FID while distance to refuge was only positively correlated with DF. Birds in rural habitats escaped earlier and further and exhibited a positive relationship between starting distance and FID, whereas no such trend was seen in urban birds, possibly due to a narrow zone of awareness. Our findings suggest that DF represents an independent and informative additional measure of antipredator behaviour that together with FID provides a more integrated view of the costs of escape. This, in turn, facilitates finding effective ways for mitigating effects of anthropogenic disturbance on wild animals. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Learning by observing others has been acknowledged as a powerful learning strategy. Whereas in several species observation of fear conditioning or other operational procedures can improve subsequent performance during actual learning, much less attention has been paid to observational learning of spatial discrimination tasks. To this end, we developed a set of procedures in which the spatial memory of adult rats, Rattus norvegicus, was tested in an eight-arm radial maze. Moreover, in view of controversial information concerning the incidence of mistakes made by demonstrators on the effectiveness of observational learning, our observer rats watched experienced or nontrained demonstrators. Food-deprived observers and demonstrators were initially habituated to the maze with all arms baited. Then observers were placed in a mesh cage positioned above the maze while a demonstrator rat was locating the spatial position of three baited arms. Rats observing conspecifics progressively learning the spatial discrimination improved subsequent performance compared to a control group watching an empty maze, but only if the configuration of baited arms presented during demonstration and testing matched. Therefore, rats integrated relevant spatial information during observation and used it efficiently when their spatial discrimination was tested in the maze. However, when the information was provided by trained demonstrators, making no mistakes and visiting only baited arms, observer rats failed to exhibit improved performance. Nevertheless, when given an initial habituation without food rewards, rats were subsequently able to benefit from observation of trained demonstrators thus showing that watching mistakes was not necessary for successful observational learning. Together, these findings indicate that rats can acquire spatial information via observation enabling more pertinent search strategies during testing and that for observation to be beneficial, what is observed must be sufficiently relevant or novel to complement existing knowledge ( here initial habituation with or without rewards).

AB Nonconscious behavioural mimicry, acting similarly to one's social partner, is thought to be a core component of group cohesion and coordination. However, the mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon are poorly understood. Understanding why behaviour is mimicked in some contexts but not in others is an important step in developing hypotheses about how and why some behaviours spread between social partners. Here we examine mimicry of routine vigilance during grazing episodes in a population of free-ranging bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis, rams. Results indicate that vigilance bouts are more likely to be mimicked when neighbouring rams are in closer proximity, more familiar with one another and posturally aligned. Additionally, older rams are more likely than young rams to mimic the vigilance bouts of others, and mimicry occurs more often when the initiating ram is lower ranking than the mimicking ram. We interpret these findings within the framework of biases in attentiveness to particular individuals as a possible mechanism leading to the occurrence of behavioural mimicry.

AB Signals used in communication are frequently complex, being composed of multiple signal components that in combination improve information transfer. A variety of morphological parts are typically used to transmit components of any given complex signal. Our understanding of why a given morphological part is used to transmit a given signal component is poor. We hypothesized that the function of a given signal component is improved by its association with its morphological part and that such parts interact functionally to transmit information. In a laboratory study we characterized the function of different floral signal components transmitted by associated floral parts and the interaction of those signal components. Using Solanum houstonii flowers, we focused on two major floral parts, corolla and anthers, involved in signalling bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, visitors. We further examined how experience affected the relationship between signal component and floral part. Floral visits involve a stepwise process in which bees approach, land and acquire pollen. We found that the corolla plays the dominant role in eliciting approaches by bees, whether naive or experienced. Landing is elicited by corolla signals and, to a lesser but additive degree, anther signals. Following experience, anther signals nearly completely dominate corolla signals in eliciting landing. The anthers convey signals mediating pollen acquisition, regardless of the bee's experience level. Our findings suggest there is selection for specific relationships between signal components and morphological parts, which in turn might drive complex signal evolution.

AB Group size effects, whereby animals allocate less time to antipredator vigilance as a function of increasing numbers of animals foraging together, are reported in many taxa, but group size is but one of many social attributes that could increase an individual's perception of predation risk or what might be referred to as a 'sense of security'. Indeed, meta-analyses suggest that group size only explains a small amount of variation in vigilance, and studies have shown that other social attributes, such as dominance status, also influence perceived risk and time allocated to vigilance. Social network analysis is an emerging technique to quantify a variety of specific social attributes, some of which have been suggested to influence 'security'. Using the proportion of time looking as an indicator of vigilance and predation risk assessment, we tested the prediction that more socially connected yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer, look less while foraging compared to their less socially connected counterparts. For females and males separately, we used observational data to create intrasexual, weighted social networks. We used principal component analysis to reduce correlated measures to unrelated and independent descriptions of connectedness. Using linear mixed effect models to account for potentially confounding variables, we found that no social network measure explained variation in vigilance. Social group size explained variation in female vigilance after accounting for variation due to vegetation height and date. Foraging group size and vegetation height explained variation in male vigilance. While social network measures themselves were not significant, our results mirror the fact that yellow-bellied marmots live in female-dominated societies and suggest that overall social group size is relatively more important for females than for males. Systematically studying whether and how social factors and intrasexual social relationships influence antipredator behaviour in other animals will create a better understanding of the benefits of sociality.

AB Social animal groups often make consensus decisions about when to return to a sleeping site after a day of foraging. These decisions can depend on extrinsic as well as intrinsic factors, and can range from unshared to shared. Here we investigated how decisions of meerkats, Suricata suricatta, to return to their burrows are coordinated, whether they are shared or monopolized by dominant individuals, and what factors influence the timing and speed of return. Individual meerkats can initiate group movements using ` lead' calls, and groups can change foraging patches using ` move' calls in a quorum response. We found that both call types could be produced during the return to the burrow, with the probability of move calls increasing as sunset approached, and the probability of lead calls increasing with greater distance to the burrow when sunset was imminent. Dominant and subordinate individuals did not differ significantly in move and lead call rate. Further, the time of return was better predicted by the foraging success of all subordinates in the group (with the group returning later when success was low) than by the foraging success of the dominant individuals. This suggests that decisions to return are shared rather than controlled by dominants. The speed of return depended both on extrinsic factors, such as the presence of pups, the time until sunset and the distance to the burrow, and on intrinsic factors such as satiation. Our results indicate that both the speed and timing of the return depend on urgency, and the higher incidence of lead calls when groups are far away from the burrow near dark suggests a possible change in the decision process from shared to unshared as urgency increases. Our study highlights the impact of time constraints during decision-making processes and in particular on the level of decision sharing. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sexual signals that are physically limited can be reliable indicators of quality or motivation in male-male competition. One such example of a motor constraint in birds is the production of repeated notes, which are limited in the frequency bandwidth and trill rate at which notes can be produced, such that it is difficult to produce wide-bandwidth notes at fast rates. How well birds maximize frequency bandwidth and trill rate is one measure of vocal performance, commonly referred to as 'vocal deviation'. In theory, fast songs with narrow bandwidths and slow songs with wide bandwidths should have similar values of vocal deviation. In many species, males respond to variation in vocal deviation, supporting the notion that it is a sexually selected signal. However, most studies test only one of these components, either trill rate or bandwidth, rather than both individually, when testing receiver response to vocal deviation. Therefore, a question remains as to whether songs with equivalent values of vocal deviation (e.g. fast songs with narrow bandwidths and slow songs with wide bandwidths) elicit similar levels of response from receivers. We tested whether receivers respond specifically to the trade-off between trill rate and bandwidth (i.e. vocal deviation) or only to variation in one of the component parts. Using territorial playback experiments with wild male white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys, we found that males approached high-performance songs (fast trill, wide bandwidth) more closely than they did lower-performance songs (fast trill, narrow bandwidth; slow trill, wide bandwidth) and they did so regardless of whether performance varied because of differences in trill rate or bandwidth. Furthermore, we found that males gave similar responses to songs of similar vocal deviation. Our results empirically support the hypothesis that receivers respond specifically to the physical limitation on the production of repeated notes.

AB Sexual selection can drive the evolution of novel traits, including behaviours, that may arise in sex-specific patterns and be under sex-steroid hormone control. In some polygynous species, males actively manipulate their display environment, likely to influence female perception of male sexual traits. As a presumptive appetitive reproductive behaviour, the motivation to manipulate the display environment may be activated by reproductive hormones and the degree of motivation may vary across individuals. To evaluate these possibilities, we examined the hormone dependence of court-clearing behaviour in lek-breeding golden-collared manakins, Manacus vitellinus, of Panama where males clean the rainforest floor of debris within display courts and maintain these cleaned courts during the long breeding season and during subsequent years. Nonbreeding females and juvenile males were given implants containing testosterone (T) or empty (control) implants and observed in a large aviary situated in the middle of Panamanian rainforest. The aviary was planted with saplings around which males display; the bare ground was covered with dried leaves. Control-treated males removed only a few leaves from their courts. T treatment dramatically stimulated court-cleaning behaviour, including both the removal of leaves and attempts to extract small seedlings from the soil. None of the females displayed court-cleaning behaviour, although T-treated females showed low levels of some male courtship displays as well as significant levels of aggressive behaviour. To assess wild adult males' motivation to clear courts, we presented lekking males with weighted artificial leaves. Males were attentive to the leaves and motivated to remove them. With increasing weight, males utilized different methods, which often involved multiple repeated attempts to move leaves. These findings demonstrate that manakins exhibit sex-specific and hormone-dependent court-cleaning behaviours and that males are highly motivated and physically adapted to keep their courts clean.

AB Since parent-offspring conflict theory was first proposed, a number of studies in a range of mammalian species have questioned its importance, suggesting that coordination, rather than conflict, occurs during weaning. In this study we propose a set of behaviours for studying the development of the mother-offspring relationship: offspring separation calls and the corresponding maternal response, which can be used to describe the continually developing motivational changes in both parties accompanying weaning. We recorded and analysed separation calls of kittens of the domestic cat, Felis silvestris catus, during the first two postnatal months, and performed playback experiments to observe their mothers' behavioural response. Three different stimuli were played back: calls of the mothers' kittens at their correct age, calls of their kittens from an earlier age (1 week old) and a control sound. We found that kittens' separation calls changed in several respects across the 8 weeks of the study. After the first postnatal month, the number, intensity and fundamental frequency of calls declined markedly, while kittens' latency to call increased. In parallel, we found that during playback tests, mothers' willingness to return to the nest or reunite with their kittens decreased notably as the kittens approached weaning age. Since this decline was present even when mothers were played back the calls of their own kittens previously recorded at an earlier age, we conclude that the decline in responsiveness was not due to a change in the kittens' vocalizations, but rather to a change in the mothers' motivational state. Our findings support the view that weaning in the domestic cat is a well-synchronized process between mothers and offspring, at least under the favourable nutritional conditions of the present study.

AB Behavioural isolation between closely related species with exaggerated male mating traits is traditionally thought to be mediated by female preference for conspecific male ornaments. The role of male mate choice in maintaining boundaries between highly sexually dimorphic species is therefore comparatively neglected. However, mounting theoretical and empirical evidence supports the existence of male mate choice both within, and increasingly, between species with exaggerated male ornaments. We therefore tested the role of male mate choice in the maintenance of species boundaries for two sexually dimorphic species of darters ( Percidae: Etheostoma). Using dichotomous choice assays, we measured male preferences of sympatric species Etheosotma barrenense and Etheosotma zonale for size-matched conspecific and heterospecific females, thus reducing the possibility that males would select for general indicators of fecundity. Our results show that males of both species strongly prefer conspecific females. A comparison with published data showed that the strength of preference for conspecific mates is just as strong for males as it is for females in E. barrenense. We also estimated the relative contribution of male mate choice, female mate choice and male-male competition to behavioural isolation. We found that male mate choice contributes as much as female mate choice to total behavioural isolation and thus likely plays an important role in behavioural isolation in these sexually dimorphic species. Our results suggest that the contribution of male choice to behavioural isolation should be studied in a larger variety of animal species to appreciate the relative roles of the sexes in the maintenance of species boundaries.

AB Numerous studies have identified cuticular compounds that distinguish adult queens from workers in social insect colonies, but how future queens are identified at the larval stage is poorly understood. Nevertheless, the ability of workers to discriminate queen and worker larvae is necessary for them to regulate caste determination and queen production. In the ant Harpegnathos saltator, workers bite larvae to inhibit queen development, and we used biting as an assay to test how workers identify queens at the larval stage. The transfer of cuticular compounds from queen to worker larvae through direct physical contact (rubbing) or using a hexane extract both elicited biting. Gas chromatography revealed significant differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of queen and worker larvae that could be induced by treatment with a juvenile hormone (JH) analogue. Finally, treatment of male larvae with a JH analogue also elicited worker biting, which suggests a direct connection between JH levels and the production of a larval queen signal. These results demonstrate that workers identify larval caste using a chemical signal present on the cuticle, a 'princess pheromone', that reflects endocrine changes associated with queen development. Based on the connection between JH levels and the production of a larval queen signal, we developed a model for caste determination in H. saltator that incorporates endocrine, pheromonal and behavioural control of caste development.

AB Although the existence of consistent between-individual differences in behaviour ('personality differences') has been well documented during the last decade, the adaptive value of such behavioural limitations remains an open field for researchers of animal behaviour. Personalities clearly restrict individuals in their ability to adjust their behaviour to different conditions. However, sheer costs of flexibility cannot explain the polymorphism created by personality variation. In a correlative approach, we here tested whether mate choice might act as a major driving force maintaining personality variation in the monogamous, biparental rainbow krib, Pelvicachromis pulcher. We personality-typed all males and females for their boldness (activity under simulated predation risk) and allowed females to choose between two males that differed in their boldness (behavioural level and consistency). Prior to the choice, females were allowed to observe both males, expressing their natural boldness towards a videoanimated natural predator. Both sexes showed personality differences in boldness over the short and long term. Furthermore, when removing side-biased females, we found a disassortative mating preference for the behavioural level and an assortative preference for behavioural consistency in boldness. These preference patterns might facilitate effective parental role allocation during offspring care and/or provide genetic benefits. Our results suggest that sexual selection plays an important role in the evolution of personality differences. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Arboreality has evolved in a wide range of taxa, but its adaptive significance has rarely been examined in natural ecosystems. Euhadra brandtii sapporo is an arboreal land snail distributed in a restricted area of Hokkaido, Japan. We hypothesized that arboreality provides the species with significant survival advantages, which we tested via field observations and experiments. A monitoring census showed that E. b. sapporo hibernates in winter in the ground litter, climbs into the canopy in early spring and returns to the ground in late autumn. This seasonal movement appears to be effective for escaping from predation by ground-dwelling carabine beetles, whose activity was high during the summer based on a pitfall-trap census. Manipulative field experiments were conducted to compare survival rates in arboreal and ground-dwelling environments. We collected 120 E. b. sapporo individuals in summer and tethered 40 in tree canopies and 80 on the ground; half those on the ground were covered by baskets to prevent predation by large animals. The survival rate after 11 days was highest in the canopy, followed by that on the ground with a basket and was lowest on the ground without a basket. Predation was the main cause of death, but some died from other causes. Similar results were obtained in autumn, except for higher survival rates of the ground treatments. Analyses of carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios suggest that the land snail uses epiphytic lichens and mosses as food resources. In conclusion, arboreality has a marked advantage in reducing mortality in E. b. sapporo and is probably supported by food availability as well.

AB In many acoustical communication systems song signals serve for mate selection. Animals thus need to make a decision about which is the best mating partner in a choice situation by integrating the cues of the available signals. In female crickets, choice behaviour is based on the attractiveness of the temporal pattern of a male's calling song and on its intensity. Signal intensity is affected by both sound amplitude and sound energy as given by the amplitude modulation. Here we targeted the psychometric functions that relate these physical cues to sensory perception in female crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus. First, no-choice tests were conducted to examine the response functions for pattern attractiveness and intensity. Second, we systematically varied pattern attractiveness and sound amplitude or sound energy of two competing signals which were presented from opposite sides in a choice situation. To examine the relative contribution of both cues to female choice behaviour an equivalence function for pattern attractiveness and signal intensity was derived which indicated at which levels both cues compensated for each other. The psychometric data and the equivalence function revealed that for patterns of high attractiveness there was a strong impact of even small intensity differences, whereas for patterns with low attractiveness large intensity differences were required to influence female decisions. Thus the integration of pattern attractiveness and intensity is provided by a gain control mechanism that reflects a nonlinear weighting of intensity differences by pattern attractiveness.

AB The vocal repertoire of nonhuman primates is largely fixed. Individuals produce their species-specific vocalizations from a young age, and do not acquire new call types over their lifetime. Despite these limitations, however, monkeys and apes are able to increase their vocal flexibility in several ways, including subtle acoustic modification, call combinations, turn-taking and call persistence. Although primates have been observed to utilize these communicative features, the extent to which they integrate these abilities is not known. Here we show that certain long-distance calls produced by wild bonobos, Pan paniscus, assimilate several aspects of vocal flexibility in ways not previously documented in nonhuman primates. Communication between foraging parties exhibits context-specific call combinations relating to the movement of caller, call modifications that potentially target particular individuals, call-and-answer exchanges in which the initial caller's behaviour depends on the listener's reply, and possible persistence in call production. The selective pressure exerted by bonobos' fissionefusion social structure has likely favoured the integration of these communicative capabilities.

AB Self-directed behaviours in primates as a response to increasing psychological or physiological stress are a well-studied phenomenon. There is some evidence that these behaviours can be contagious when observed by conspecifics, but the adaptive function of this process is unclear. The ability to perceive stress in others and respond to it could be an important part of sustaining cohesiveness in social primates, but spontaneously acquiring stress-related behaviours (and potentially emotional states) from all group mates via contagion could be maladaptive. To investigate this, a group of captive Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, were presented with videos of conspecifics engaging in self-directed behaviour (scratching) and neutral behaviour. Behavioural responses as a result of exposure to the stimuli were compared (1) between familiar and unfamiliar individuals, and (2) within familiar individuals to consider the modulating effects of social relationships. Our results did not show contagious scratching in this species. However, there were differences in how individuals attended to the scratching stimuli. Subjects were more attentive to scratching videos than to neutral videos and familiar than unfamiliar individuals. Within the familiar individuals, subjects were more attentive to those to whom they were weakly bonded. We suggest that increased attention to scratching behaviours may be adaptive in order to monitor and avoid stressed group mates, whose subsequent behaviour may be unpredictable and aggressive. Monitoring group mates who are not allies may also be adaptive as they may pose the biggest risk. These findings will help increase our understanding of subtle cues that can be communicative in primates, and also the evolutionary steps towards understanding others.

AB During sexual selection members of the opposite sex utilize a variety of signal modalities to acquire information about potential mates. As a prerequisite, signal modalities must exhibit intraspecific variation and correlate with desirable traits that reflect the fitness of the signaller. Anecdotal accounts suggest that female psyllids (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha) utilize substrate-borne vibrations (SBVs) to choose between males. However, comprehensive studies investigating the role of SBVs in Psylloidea are lacking. We used laser vibrometry and playback experiments to study the mating and calling behaviours of a psyllid, Aacanthocnema dobsoni (Triozidae). Specifically, we quantified call parameters and asked whether they vary intraspecifically and correlate with male body size and age. We also tested whether female responsiveness is influenced by the body size and age of calling males. Calls were sex-specific: male calls were more complex and comprised long and short syllables while female calls comprised only short syllables. Temporal and spectral parameters of male calls differed significantly from those of female calls. Calls of both sexes exhibited a high level of intraspecific variation. Larger males produced calls with a lower dominant frequency and older males produced calls of higher intensity and pulse rate. We used playback to test female responsiveness to calls recorded from males of contrasting sizes and ages. Surprisingly, female responsiveness was not influenced by body size or the age of calling males. Interestingly, females are polyandrous but only virgins called or responded to male calls. Conversely, males called frequently and attempted (and often succeeded) to mate with unresponsive females. These results demonstrate that A. dobsoni utilizes SBVs for mate attraction but not for precopulatory mate selection. We suggest that polyandry in A. dobsoni potentially evolved in response to male harassment and, as a consequence of polyandry, sexual selection is probably achieved via postcopulatory sexual selection mechanisms.

AB In many animal species, mothers expose their embryos to maternal hormones. This provides a powerful pathway for affecting offspring phenotype and a potential mechanism for adaptive nongenomic inheritance. This has been studied extensively in birds because the embryo develops outside the mother's body, facilitating experimental studies. Some studies have demonstrated that maternal yolk testosterone (T) can have long-lasting effects into the period after fledging. However, these results are based on offspring in the juvenile stage or their first breeding season only. The lack of data further into adulthood limits a better assessment of the fitness consequences of prenatal T. In a series of previous experiments in the rock pigeon, Columba livia, we manipulated yolk T levels using oil-injected eggs as controls. In the present study, we examined the reproductive behaviour of birds from these eggs when they were 1-3 years old and housed together in a large aviary. Our results showed that males from T-injected eggs were less aggressive and females from T-injected eggs laid lighter eggs than controls. Moreover, the experimental birds showed strongly disassortative mating with respect to hormone treatment. There were no indications of treatment effects on the process of sexual differentiation. Our results indicate that the effects of prenatal T do not diminish over age and may last far into adulthood, which should be taken into account in assessing the fitness consequences of maternal hormones. They may also stimulate new physiological and neurobiological studies on the mechanisms underlying such long-lasting effects of prenatal T exposure.

AB There is increasing evidence that animal personalities are linked to different life history strategies. However, studies examining whether these effects differ under varying environmental conditions are rare. Here, we investigated how animal personality affects reproductive success in a pulsed resource consumer, the wild boar. We determined the exploratory behaviour of 57 female wild boars in nine novel object tests and additionally assessed their aggressiveness. Exploration behaviour (i.e. approach latency and investigation duration) and aggressiveness were repeatable within individuals and both mapped on a single principal component yielding an individual personality score. Afterwards the females were kept together with 28 males under seminatural conditions in two large breeding enclosures from 2011 to 2014. Over winter 2013/2014 we applied high versus medium feeding regimes to the two enclosures. Our results show that adult body mass and reproductive success were affected by juvenile body mass and thus already determined early in life, which may point to a silver spoon effect in the wild boar. Whether a female reproduced or not, as well as the litter size shortly after birth, was only affected by female body mass. The postweaning litter size (i.e. at the time of independence at the age of about 6 months), however, was additionally affected by the personality score in interaction with food availability. Under high food availability less aggressive and explorative individuals raised more juveniles to independence. We conclude that lower aggressiveness and reduced exploratory tendency of the mother lead to lower juvenile mortality and hence have a positive impact on postweaning litter size. Under slightly decreased food availability, however, this effect vanished. As the impact of personality on reproductive success differed between changing environmental conditions, our results support the hypothesis that different personality phenotypes are evolutionarily maintained by varying selection pressures in heterogeneous environments.

AB The ways in which animal societies respond to threat has enormous consequences for their success. In the present study, we investigated how group personality composition in social spiders (Stegodyphus dumicola) alters groups' average response towards predators and how their responses change with experience with important predators, Anoplolepis custodiens ants. We found that colonies composed of a mixture of 'bold' and 'shy' personality types exhibited twice as much defensive web-making behaviour as other colony compositions. Colony defensive behaviour was also more temporally stable following experience with predators for 'mixed' colonies than for either monotypic composition (all shy or all bold). Colonies composed of bold individuals were particularly erratic in their defensive behaviour over time. Thus, colony composition altered colony-level plasticity in response to experience with one of their most voracious predators. We additionally observed the behaviour of marked individuals within colonies to determine which individual traits were associated with task participation during encounters with predators. Individual morphology and boldness both predicted task participation at the individual level, with boldness being negatively associated with participation in the attack sequence, but positively associated with defensive silk making. Low body condition also proved to be important for predicting participation in any task. Lastly, despite a tight association between colony composition and colony defensive behaviour, we found no evidence that colony composition affected colony survival during ant attacks in situ. Instead, older and more established nests were positively associated with colony persistence during attacks. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The social acquisition of life skills is essential in a wide range of species. Field experiments have demonstrated that naive young learn particularly from their parents how to deal with predators or how to find suitable food. However, it remains unclear whether the response of young differs in a novel situation when together with related (i.e. parents) or unrelated role models. We addressed this question in a group-living bird species, the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus, groups of which can contain both related and unrelated juveniles. Groups are formed around a breeding pair which engages in prolonged parental care, facilitating delayed dispersal of offspring for up to 5 years. About 25% of juveniles are killed by predators during their first year of life, suggesting that predator avoidance is a crucial life skill for juveniles. Exposing groups to perched predator models showed that kinship influenced how juveniles responded to the mobbing behaviour of breeders. Upon exposure to a predator model, related juveniles immediately paid attention to the behaviour of breeders and copied most of their movements. In contrast, unrelated juveniles copied the behaviour of breeders less frequently, but regularly foraged in the presence of a predator model. These results show that juveniles respond differently to parents and unrelated role models, potentially affecting the acquisition of vital life skills. Parental care creates a close social bond, predisposing juveniles to pay attention especially to novel behaviours shown by their caregivers. Furthermore, parents have a fitness benefit from facilitating the skill acquisition of their offspring. Thus, a prolonged parent-offspring association is likely to enhance skill acquisition and influence cognitive evolution across species. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Providing nutritional gifts to females during mating is common in several insect species. Although nuptial gifts are well known in the bushcrickets, the specific way in which females use spermatophore material is unclear. In previous research, we found that a portion of the spermatophore is used for body homeostasis in the hours following mating. Other spermatophore materials can later be found in the muscles of females. Here, we examined whether consuming a nuptial gift alters subsequent feeding patterns in females of the herbivorous bushcricket Poecilimon ampliatus. We tested the prediction that nuptial feeding in bushcricket females replaces their normal plant diet. Our alternative hypothesis was that females with and without spermatophore feeding would eat the same amount of plant food. Our results were contradictory: in the first 12 h after eating a spermatophore, females consumed less plant material. In the second 12 h period, they consumed more plant material. Over the entire 4.5-day experiment, spermatophore feeding had no influence on leaf consumption. Possible explanations for these discrepancies are that females prefer spermatophores to vegetation, and thus consume spermatophores during the first 12 h period. But spermatophore nutrients may be rapidly digested and assimilated, leaving female guts empty and leading to increased plant feeding during the second 12 h period. Hence, our results suggest that in bushcrickets, spermatophores replace the normal female diet in the short term, but supplement it in the long term.

AB Transitioning between life stages involves significant changes to the physiology, structural morphology, biochemistry and behaviour of an organism. Eclosion, metamorphosis and the onset of sexual maturity have consequences for the life history evolution of an organism by initiating reproductive and dispersalrelated behaviours that are both energetically costly and directly related to fitness. Animal movement, particularly dispersal when sexually mature, is critical for mate location, controlling population density and promoting gene flow. Here we examined changes in dispersal-related and physiological traits during a significant transitional period in red flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum. We measured the metabolic rate, spontaneous activity, body size and movement behaviour traits of individuals of known age and sex. Traits were compared between immature and sexually mature adults as well as during early adult life when there is a strong tendency to disperse and reproduce. Spontaneous activity, movement speed and metabolic rate were distinctly reduced in immature adults prior to the onset of sexual maturity, and immature individuals moved more intermittently than mature ones. We found that these traits increased with age following eclosion, up to a relatively stable mean once sexual maturity was attained. The reduced metabolic expenditure found in immature individuals was attributable to a reduced energy demand due to relative inactivity, which we hypothesize to be a protective mechanism from conspecifics while the cuticle is undergoing sclerotization. Understanding the precise developmental trajectories of behavioural and physiological traits allows us to interpret the trait syndromes that underlie dispersal and their evolution.

AB Past risk-sensitive foraging studies commonly manipulated delay to reward and reward magnitude, but recent risk-sensitive foraging research revealed that changes in reward quality resulted in changes in a forager's preference for a variable or fixed return. However, no studies have investigated the effects of changes in reward quality and delay to reward on risk sensitivity. Therefore, the current experiment was designed to explore rats' preference for a variable or fixed option when delay to reward and reward quality were manipulated. Using a within-subjects, ABACADA design, rats (N = 10) choose between a variable and constant option that delivered six food pellets but the amount of sugar (i.e. reward quality) and delay to reward differed per condition. In each baseline condition, pellets were 100% sugar and delivered after a 2 s mean delay. Subjects displayed a significant preference for the variable option in all baseline conditions. In condition B, pellets were 20% sugar, delivered after a 2 s mean delay, and rats were risk indifferent. In condition C, rats displayed a significant preference for the variable option when delay was 10 s and reward quality was 100%. Finally, in condition D, subjects showed the strongest variable option responses among all treatments when both reward quality and delay to reward were manipulated (i.e. 20% sugar pellets and 10 s mean delay). Preference was assessed relative to the daily energy budget rule, the scalar utility theory and the sequential choice model. The sequential choice model provided the most comprehensive and accurate prediction of subjects' preferences. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The visual systems of many animals feature energetically costly specializations to enable them to function in dim light. It is often unclear, however, how large the behavioural benefit of these specializations is, because a direct comparison in a behaviourally relevant task between closely related day- and night-active species is not usually possible. Here we compared the orientation performance of diurnal and nocturnal species of dung beetles, Scarabaeus (Kheper) lamarcki and Scarabaeus satyrus, respectively, attempting to roll dung balls along straight paths both during the day and at night. Using video tracking, we quantified the straightness of paths and the repeatability of roll bearings as beetles exited a flat arena in their natural habitat or under controlled conditions indoors. Both species oriented equally well when either the moon or an artificial point light source was available, but when the view of the moon was blocked and only wide-field cues such as the lunar polarization pattern or the stars were available for orientation, nocturnal beetles were oriented substantially better. We found no evidence that ball-rolling speed changed with light level, which suggests little or no temporal summation in the visual system. Finally, we found that both diurnal and nocturnal beetles tended to choose bearings that led them towards a bright light source, but away from a dim one. Our results show that even diurnal insects, at least those with superposition eyes, could orient by the light of the moon, but that dim-light adaptations are needed for precise orientation when the moon is not visible.

AB In many social species, group members cooperate to defend a communal home range. Fighting in between-group conflicts carries an opportunity cost, a risk of injury or death, and the possibility of exploitation by free-riding group members. As a result, it is rare that all group members fight in a given between-group conflict, and individual participation in range defence is often highly variable. Thus, to understand the patterns of behaviour observed at the group level, we must first understand the causes of within- and between-individual variability. Although sex differences have been well studied, our understanding of the relative importance of the various mechanisms promoting between-group aggression within a sex is limited. We observed the participation of 22 male vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus, in 126 between-group conflicts, and then partitioned aggressive acts according to the context in which they occurred. Using this approach, we found evidence that two mechanisms drive male between-group aggression and, therefore, that individual variability is in part driven by the multiple selective benefits of participation. First, males that were likely to have sired offspring tended to exhibit defensive aggression and were more active when infants were present in the group, suggesting they fight to defend probable offspring. Second, males were more likely to support females in initiating between-group aggression just prior to, and during, the mating season. Female vervet monkeys are able to exert female choice, and males that frequently supported female instigators tended to enjoy the highest mating success. These results indicate that males probably use between-group aggression to improve their reputation with choosy females and subsequently maximize their mating success. Our findings indicate that a greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms promoting cooperative home range defence can be gained if we consider the context in which acts of between-group aggression occur.

AB When two food patches are available, individuals of many animal species feed on the larger one, a preference frequently used to study numerical abilities in mammals and birds. We employed this method to investigate, for the first time, food quantity discrimination and its underlying mechanisms in a fish, the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Guppies facing two sets of similar-sized food items successfully discriminated numerosity up to a 0.5 ratio (one versus four and two versus four items, but not two versus three or three versus four food items). A further experiment suggested that guppies attended to cumulative surface area of food items rather than number to select the larger quantity. Moreover, in a two versus four discrimination in which the cumulative surface area occupied by food was matched by using larger items in the set with fewer items, guppies unexpectedly showed a preference for the smaller numerosity. Since this result might be explained by assuming that guppies selected the larger food item, we performed additional experiments to test this hypothesis. Guppies were observed to be very accurate in estimating item size, being able to discriminate between two food items that differed by a ratio of 0.75 in surface area. The attraction to the larger food item was so strong that guppies preferred the set containing the largest item even when the other set contained a double quantity of food. Since guppies in the wild forage in groups and compete for food, we hypothesized that in this species natural selection has favoured cognitive mechanisms allowing a rapid and efficient choice of the most profitable food item within the patch.

AB Broad sense repeatability, which refers to the extent to which individual differences in trait scores are maintained over time, is of increasing interest to researchers studying behavioural or physiological traits. Broad sense repeatability is most often inferred from the statistic R (the intraclass correlation, or narrow sense repeatability). However, R ignores change over time, despite the inherent longitudinal nature of the data (repeated measures over time). Here, we begin by showing that most studies ignore time-related change when estimating broad sense repeatability, and estimate R with low statistical power. Given this problem, we (1) outline how and why ignoring time-related change in scores (that occurs for whatever reason) can seriously affect estimates of the broad sense repeatability of behavioural or physiological traits, (2) discuss conditions in which various indices of R can or cannot provide reliable estimates of broad sense repeatability, and (3) provide suggestions for experimental designs for future studies. Finally, given that we already have abundant evidence that many labile traits are 'repeatable' in that broad sense (i.e. R > 0), we suggest a shift in focus towards obtaining robust estimates of the repeatability of behavioural and physiological traits. Given how labile these traits are, this will require greater experimental (and/or statistical) control and larger sample sizes in order to detect and quantify change over time (if present).

AB In most primate societies, strong and enduring social bonds form preferentially among kin, who benefit from cooperation through direct and indirect fitness gains. Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, differ from most species by showing consistent female-biased dispersal and strict male philopatry. In most East African populations, females tend to forage alone in small core areas and were long thought to have weak social bonds of little biological significance. Recent work in some populations is challenging this view. However, difficulties remain in quantifying the influence of shared space use on association patterns, and in identifying the drivers of partner preferences and social bonds. Here, we use the largest data set on wild chimpanzee behaviour currently available to assess potential determinants of female association patterns. We quantify pairwise similarities in ranging, dyadic association and grooming for 624 unique dyads over 38 years, including 17 adult female kin dyads. To search for social preferences that could not be explained by spatial overlap alone, we controlled for expected association based on pairwise kernel volume intersections of core areas. We found that association frequencies among females with above-average overlap correlated positively with grooming rates, suggesting that associations reflected social preferences in these dyads. Furthermore, when available, females preferred kin over nonkin partners for association and grooming, and variability was high among nonkin dyads. While variability in association above and below expected values was high, on average, nonkin associated more frequently if they had immature male offspring, while having female offspring had the opposite effect. Dominance rank, an important determinant of reproductive success at Gombe, influenced associations primarily for low-ranking females, who associated preferentially with each other. Our findings support the hypothesis that female chimpanzees form well-differentiated social relationships that are of potential adaptive value to females and their offspring.

AB Many ants forage in complex environments and use a combination of trail pheromone information and route memory to navigate between food sources and the nest. Previous research has shown that foraging routes differ in how easily they are learned. In particular, it is easier to learn feeding locations that are reached by repeating (e.g. left-left or right-right) than alternating choices (left-right or right-left) along a route with two T-bifurcations. This raises the hypothesis that the learnability of the feeding sites may influence overall colony foraging patterns. We studied this in the mass-recruiting ant Lasius niger. We used mazes with two T-bifurcations, and allowed colonies to exploit two equidistant food sources that differed in how easily their locations were learned. In experiment 1, learnability was manipulated by using repeating versus alternating routes from nest to feeder. In experiment 2, we added visual landmarks along the route to one food source. Our results suggest that colonies preferentially exploited the feeding site that was easier to learn. This was the case even if the more difficult to learn feeding site was discovered first. Furthermore, we show that these preferences were at least partly caused by lower error rates (experiment 1) and greater foraging speeds (experiment 2) of foragers visiting the more easily learned feeder locations. Our results indicate that the learnability of feeding sites is an important factor influencing collective foraging patterns of ant colonies under more natural conditions, given that in natural environments foragers often face multiple bifurcations on their way to food sources.

AB The outcome of sexual selection acting on a given sexual trait depends on the interaction between the strength, direction and form of both inter- and intrasexual selection processes. Therefore, determining female choice and maleemale competition is necessary to gain a better understanding of how sexual selection acts on sexual traits. Anuran males produce advertisement vocalizations to attract females and to maintain other males at distance, providing a convenient opportunity to test the combined effect of inter- and intrasexual selection. Our main objective was to test experimentally potential effects of female choice and maleemale competition and their interaction when acting as selective agents on the advertisement vocalizations of the rosy ground frog, Eupsophus roseus. We performed phonotaxis experiments on females and males and determined their behavioural responses to artificial signals synthesized based on the distribution of natural calls. The main results suggest that females' preference would favour vocalizations having lower frequencies and a harmonic composition in which the main harmonics of vocalizations have similar amplitudes. These preferences suggest that females could exert negative directional sexual selection on the frequency and stabilizing selection on the amplitude ratio. The responses of males were variable, suggesting that this type of maleemale competition may not result in intrasexual selection favouring specific values of advertisement vocalizations. The occurrence of no clear preferences in males may result in a decrease in the potential effect of females' preferences, which could further contribute to variability in spectral components of calls.

AB The localization of acoustic signals is an important component of mating behaviour in many species. However, in natural environments sound localization may be hindered by background noise that masks acoustic cues that enable the determination of sound direction by the auditory system. I studied the effects of noise on the sound localization abilities of male grasshoppers, Chorthippus biguttulus, in response to female songs. Males respond to female songs with a stereotyped lateralization behaviour in which they turn towards the perceived sound direction; repetition of this behaviour allows them to approach females. Under quiet conditions, males are highly sensitive to small differences in the timing or amplitude of signals that arrive at each ear. I tested whether noise affected male lateralization accuracy by presenting males with female songs that differed in time or amplitude cues of sound direction, under different levels of masking noise. Noise sharply reduced the responsiveness of males to female songs. However, when males did lateralize the female song, they were surprisingly accurate, even at the highest noise levels. These results suggest that noise only weakly impairs males' directional hearing abilities, but strongly affects their abilities to detect and respond to female songs. Noise therefore probably increases mating costs, because both males and females must expend additional time and energy in mate attraction. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Androgenic hormones can rapidly influence how animals behave, although the dynamics of these effects remain elusive. In particular, we know little about whether androgens rapidly impact behavioural strategizing or whether such effects vary among individuals of the same species. Here, we examine these issues by testing how transient testosterone (T) surges, which normally occur in response to social stimuli, rapidly alter the urinary marking behaviour of socially subordinate and dominant male white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus. Marking behaviour in mice is important in reproductive competition and advertisement; thus, how an individual marks its environment with urine likely reflects the strategy it uses to find a mate. Moreover, urine-marking patterns are indicative of social status and territorial propensity. Our results show that a single T pulse, within minutes, suppresses all measures of urinary marking behaviour in subordinate mice, including amounts of perimeter (territorial) marking and total (status-related) marking. These effects are not observed in dominant mice. The data collectively suggest that androgens rapidly change behaviour tightly associated with reproductive strategy and decision making. Moreover, these effects depend on an individual's social status, which suggests that there is intraspecific variation in the way that androgens affect marking behaviour on short timescales. This study fills a gap in our understanding about the plasticity of rapid androgenic effects on behaviour, and how these responses can influence adaptive reproductive tactics.

AB Aggressive behaviours have an important impact on the social organization of animals and on the social status of individuals, especially in gregarious species. Agonistic interactions between territory holders are essential to set and reinforce territorial borders. Additionally, agonistic displays are used to demonstrate ownership of a territorial site and may indicate social status of the signaller. Between neighbouring territory owners, dynamic borders require frequent interactions. In daily repeated aggressive encounters, ritualization can help to avoid the need for serious fights and their costly consequences. In the bat Carollia perspicillata, a gregarious frugivore with resource defence polygyny, males defend territories at valuable roosting sites for females. Working with a captive bat colony of about 400 individuals, housed under seminatural conditions in a tropical zoo, we found that males defended territories aggressively by the use of a succession of displays forming a ritualized structure. Simultaneously, males used three different vocalization types during aggressive displays, namely down-sweeps, warbles and aggressive trills. A statistical analysis of 58 aggressive trills from five adult males showed that they contained sufficient variation to encode an individual signature. Using a habituation-dishabituation paradigm playback experiment, we found that males could discriminate between vocalizing males based on aggressive calls alone. Such discrimination is probably useful for distinguishing between neighbouring territory owners and more unfamiliar intruders, and thus allows for an economical response.

AB Sleep is of major importance to most organisms but insights into how sleep is affected by ecological processes are largely lacking. Perceived predation risk constitutes a major factor that should shape adaptive phenotypic plasticity in sleep but it is unclear to what degree an individual can tailor sleep to different types of risk. If animals base behavioural decisions on the predation landscape then we would expect individuals to adjust their sleep behaviour when exposed to changes in predation risk. Here we investigated the plasticity of phenotypic sleep in wild great tits roosting in nestboxes and exposed to different types of predation risk. Following our prediction, when exposed to experimentally increased perceived predation risk from owls, Strix aluco (a bird that can prey on birds solely outside their roosting cavity), individuals increased total sleep duration. Contrary to our prediction, when exposed to experimentally increased perceived predation risk from martens, Martes martes (a mammal that can prey on birds inside cavities), individuals woke up less often during the night, but otherwise did not change their sleep behaviour. Birds did not alter total time spent awake during the night in response to predator exposure. Our findings demonstrate that individual great tits modify their sleep behaviour in response to changes in predation risk. Ecological factors including exposure to predators, resource availability and reproductive competition may act as significant constraints on natural sleep patterns and warrant further investigation with free- living individuals.

AB Although in anurans the predominant mode of intra-and intersexual communication is vocalization, modalities used in addition to or instead of acoustic signals range from seismic and visual to chemical. In some cases, signals of more than one modality are produced through or by the anuran vocal sac. However, its role beyond acoustics has been neglected for some time and nonacoustic cues such as vocal sac movement have traditionally been seen as an epiphenomenon of sound production. The diversity in vocal sac coloration and shape found in different species is striking and recently its visual properties have been given a more important role in signalling. Chemosignals seem to be the dominant communication mode in newts, salamanders and caecilians and certainly play a role in the aquatic life phase of anurans, but airborne chemical signalling has received less attention. There is, however, increasing evidence that at least some terrestrial anuran species integrate acoustic, visual and chemical cues in species recognition and mate choice and a few secondarily mute anuran species seem to fully rely on volatile chemical cues produced in glands on the vocal sac. Within vertebrates, frogs in particular are suitable organisms for investigating multimodal communication by means of experiments, since they are tolerant of disturbance by observers and can be easily manipulated under natural conditions. Thus, the anuran vocal sac might be of great interest not only to herpetologists, but also to behavioural biologists studying communication systems. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Many species benefit from listening to the vocalizations of their predators as well as the alarm vocalizations of other species. This eavesdropping is an important way to acquire information regarding predator location and threat magnitude. Previous studies have investigated lizards eavesdropping on predators, while others have studied lizards eavesdropping on alarm calls. Studies that examine lizard responses to playbacks of both predatory calls and heterospecific alarm calls are absent, even though eavesdropping may be especially important in nonvocal species. By comparing both types of calls, we can assess their relative importance to skinks and understand how skinks discriminate between these calls. We broadcast sympatric predator vocalizations and both alarm call and nonalarm social vocalizations from a nonpredatory bird (red-vented bulbul, Pycnonotus cafer) to determine whether nonvocal, white-bellied copper-striped skinks could discriminate among them. Upon hearing red-vented bulbul alarm calls, white-bellied copper-striped skinks reduced their rate of looking and increased their rate of bloating compared to a baseline period. However, they did not respond significantly to red-vented bulbul social calls or to vocalizations from potential predators. Our study is the first to look at the relative magnitude of response to playbacks of predator and heterospecific vocalizations in lizards. White-bellied copper-striped skinks most likely depend on heterospecific vocalizations for predator information because they are nonvocal and found low on the forest floor, making it harder for them to identify predators directly than through alarm calls of avian heterospecifics.

AB Dogs, Canis familiaris, and other domestic species are more skilled than great apes at following human communicative gestures in object choice tasks. Several hypotheses differentially emphasizing the role of domestication, socialization and experience have been put forward to account for this discrepancy. Recently, it has been suggested that the performance gap between apes and domestic species could be due instead to inconsistent methodologies across studies. Apes have generally been tested with the containers directly in front of them, and the experimenter performing the communicative cue behind the containers (central set-up). In contrast, domestic animals are usually placed at a larger distance with the human experimenter performing the cue in their direct line of sight and the containers peripheral on both sides of the experimenter (peripheral set-up). The distraction hypothesis posits that the close proximity of the food-associated containers in the central set-up proves too distracting for the test subjects, leading to an indiscriminate choice behaviour. Consistent with this idea, great apes are able to solve the peripheral version of the object choice task. To evaluate the distraction hypothesis further, we tested domestic dogs and cats, Felis catus, in the central as well as the peripheral set-up. As predicted, dogs' performance dropped significantly when tested in the central version of the task compared with the peripheral one. Cats performed as well as dogs in the peripheral version, but, intriguingly, their success levels did not decline significantly in the central version. We speculate that this might be due to cats cuing into the movement part of the pointing gesture. These findings partly support the distraction hypothesis and add to the evidence that domestic species do not necessarily have superior skills in reading human communicative cues.

AB The strategies that animals use to obtain valuable resources are affected by resource quality and availability (e. g. spatial distribution), population dynamics (e. g. competitor-to-resource ratio) and individual characteristics (e. g. competitive ability). Theoretical papers and field observations suggest that aggressive resource competition, particularly by individuals with high competitive ability, increases as the competitor-to-resource ratio increases. On the other hand, individuals with low competitive ability should adopt a scramble competitive strategy, for example by expanding their home range or utilizing resources at suboptimal times. We tested these theoretical predictions in male house mice, Mus musculus domesticus, by experimentally manipulating the distribution of a desirable resource, a running wheel. Four male mice were exposed to three treatments (zero, one or four running wheels present) using a repeated measures design. We found that aggression increased as the competitor-to-resource ratio increased. In addition, mice with high competitive ability had species-typical nocturnally biased activity and running wheel use patterns, while mice with low competitive ability had more diurnally biased activity and running wheel use patterns. Our results show that aggression encourages less competitive mice to adopt a scramble competitive strategy through temporal partitioning and provides empirical evidence for the predictions of resource defence theory.

AB Empirical studies identifying the causes of variation in mate preference are needed to assist in determining when variation is adaptive. We examined the strength of female preference in the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus for two sexually selected male traits (body size and symmetrical bar number) across variation in both embryonic and postembryonic environments. We measured brood size, then split fry from each brood into high- and low-quality diet treatments. Once females reached sexual maturity, we tested their mate preferences using dummies in dichotomous choice tests. Both the embryonic (brood size) and postembryonic (diet) environment influenced females' strength of preference for symmetrical bar number; females from smaller broods as well as females raised on high-quality diets had a stronger preference for symmetrical bars. However, only the postembryonic environment influenced preference for male size, with females on the low-quality diet having a stronger preference for larger males. There was no relationship between the strength of preference for the two traits across females. Our results demonstrate that plasticity in mate preferences can depend on the specific traits being assessed. We hypothesize that at least one of the preferences may be tracking the conditions that influence signal reliability of the preferred trait. In addition, we demonstrate an influence of the embryonic environment on mate preference, which is rarely considered or controlled for in studies of adaptive variation in mate preferences.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB Natal dispersal contributes to population dynamics and genetic structure. Individuals differ in whether or not they disperse and in the distance they travel from their natal site before settling to breed. Differences in natal dispersal are often associated with variation in other traits. These associations may arise because suites of morphological and behavioural traits are ultimately controlled by the same set of genes. The genes that control melanogenesis in vertebrates pleiotropically influence physiology and behaviour, including boldness and exploration. Because these personality traits predict dispersal, we tested the hypothesis that in the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, melanic coloration predicts natal dispersal, using a solid matched case-control sampling design and a large sample. We found that males but not females with colour traits that reflect relatively more pheomelanic feather pigmentation were more likely to disperse, consistently with observations on the only other species for which dispersal in relation to plumage melanic coloration has so far been studied. To control for any confounding effects, we also analysed the association of dispersal with morphological traits and parasite infestation. Philopatric individuals were larger than dispersers, whereas dispersal strategy did not differ according to tail length, which is a sexually selected trait. Finally, philopatric females had a smaller infestation of a haematophagous louse fly. The present findings corroborate previous evidence that melanic coloration covaries with a suite of traits. In particular, they show that melanin-based plumage coloration predicts natal dispersal, independently of other factors also influencing dispersal. In addition, our results show that philopatric individuals were larger than dispersers possibly because individuals return to a benign natal place or because large body size confers an advantage in competitive interactions. Finally, they are compatible with the idea of host adaptation to local strains of a parasite with presumably small population size and low dispersing capacity.

AB According to classic ecological models, nonterritorial males should settle in low-quality habitats as a result of losing competition over reproductive sites ('defeated male' hypothesis). Alternatively, according to evolutionary game theory models, nonterritorial males should settle in the vicinity of high-quality sites and 'choose' to delay breeding until these habitats are vacant for them ('male player' hypothesis). However, nonterritorial male spatial distribution has not been experimentally tested. If the defeated male hypothesis is true (1) deterioration of high-quality sites should increase the number of nonterritorial males in a population and (2) vacated low-quality territories should be taken over by new territorial males. If the male player hypothesis is true, a similar manipulation should (1) decrease the number of nonterritorial males and (2) vacated low-quality territories should not be taken over. We performed two types of field experiment to test these hypotheses: male removal and patch quality manipulation. Our study species was the territorial damselfly Calopteryx splendens; males of this species exhibit both territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Our results suggest that deterioration of highquality habitats significantly reduced the number of nonterritorial males. The proportion of take-overs of the high-quality territories was significantly higher than that of low-quality territories. Our study supports the assumptions of the male player hypothesis and indicates that nonterritorial damselflies are more sensitive to habitat quality changes than territorial ones. Because nonterritorial individuals exist in most populations of territorial taxa, a better understanding of their settlement rules may be relevant for population dynamics and modelling.

AB A major assumption of sexual selection theory is that ornaments and weapons are costly. Such costs should maintain the reliability of ornaments and weapons as indicators of male quality, and therefore explain why choosy females and rival males pay attention to these traits. However, honest signalling may not depend on costs if the penalty for cheating is sufficiently high, a situation that is likely to be true for most weapons because they are frequently tested during combat. We examined and summarized the costs of producing and carrying giant horns in the rhinoceros beetle, Trypoxylus dichotomus. Remarkably, we found no evidence for fitness costs. Previously we found that horns do not impair flight performance, and here we found that horns did not stunt the growth of other body structures or weaken the beetles' immune response. Finally, and most importantly, horns did not reduce male survival in the field. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that the exaggerated horns of T. dichotomus are surprisingly inexpensive. We discuss why weapons may be inherently less costly than ornaments, and suggest that the lack of fitness costs offers a simple, yet unexpected, explanation for why rhinoceros beetle horns are both elaborate and diverse.

AB In his paper 'Parental investment: a prospective analysis', Maynard Smith (1977, Animal Behaviour, 25,1-9) introduced a game-theoretic approach to understanding the evolution of parental behaviour and addressed the broad issue of which sex should provide care for the young. This paperwas important in that it introduced the use of game theory to the analysis of parental care. It also stimulated empirical work on care. We identify progress that has been made since the publication of the paper. In particular, although Model 2 of Maynard Smith (1977) has been used in several textbooks to explain the evolution of care, subsequent work has shown that this model is not built on a consistent view of how parental care influences future reproductive success through its effect on the sex ratio. Several models incorporate a consistent account in which opportunities to remate after desertion emerge from the analysis, rather than being specified in advance. More generally, it is not possible to consider parental care in isolation from factors such as paternity, mating preferences and mate choice behaviour. We identify various theoretical and empirical issues in the area of parental care research that we believe deserve further study if our understanding of care decisions is to advance. Taken together, the landmark paper of Maynard Smith (1977) stimulated new theoretical and empirical studies in parental care research and led to new insights into the behavioural interactions between males and females.

AB Escape tactics and optimal refuge use have attracted considerable interest, but the influence of pregnancy on escape tactics remains understudied. For instance, embryonic sensitivity to environmental conditions and maternal constraints vary dramatically across pregnancy, and these dynamics should modulate the cost-benefit balance of refuge use. We experimentally studied thermoregulation and refuge use in pregnant and nonreproductive aspic vipers, Vipera aspis, at different stages of gestation (first, middle and last third). We determined preferred body temperatures (T-set) in a cost-free environment to test for fecundity and stage dependencies of maternal T-set. Then, we examined behavioural responses to repeated simulated predatory attacks. Pregnant females were extremely precise thermoregulators compared with nonreproductive females, and T-set was independent of litter size or gestation stage. After simulated attacks, pregnant females limited their time spent in the refuge and thereby their deviation from T-set. By contrast, nonreproductive females had a greater response to predation exposure and adjusted their response to risk level. Contrary to our predictions, pregnant females did not vary their behaviour based on gestation stage, despite increasing physical burden as pregnancy progressed. Overall, our results illustrate that pregnant females alter their behaviour to benefit their developing embryos thermally despite risk to themselves (increased exposure). By doing so, however, the female realizes a benefit by accelerating temperature-sensitive developmental time and thus reducing the duration of pregnancy and associated physical burden.

AB Individual honeybee foragers often need to decide between using private versus social information when choosing where to forage. Social information is provided by the waggle dances made by successful foragers. Experienced foragers also have private information about the feeding sites they have previously visited. Previous work has shown that honeybees are flexible in their information use strategy. However, the conditions that favour the use of one information source over the other remain poorly understood. It has been suggested that foragers rely more on social information when use of private information becomes more costly. We tested this by training two groups of foragers to two feeding sites, 120 or 600 m from the hive, both providing a sucrose solution identical in concentration. We then made these two locations unrewarding and observed whether foragers trained to the further, and therefore more costly to check, site paid more attention to dances for a third, closer site (120 m in a different direction) than foragers trained to the 120 m site. Contrary to prediction, foragers trained to the 600 m feeder followed dances for the novel feeder less (25% fewer waggle runs) than foragers trained to 120 m feeder. Foragers from the distant feeding site were also not more likely to arrive at the food source advertised by dances. Our results suggest that higher costs of private information do not increase the use of social information as long as bees are satisfied with their original food source (i.e. they use a 'copy-if-dissatisfied' strategy). Additionally, we show that switching from private to social information is preceded by a rapid motivational change. Minutes before switching to the advertised resource, the foragers increased their dance-following time by 65% compared with earlier dances. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Prey can defend themselves against predators in many different ways. Social insects, such as ants, possess particularly effective defensive systems. Some predators are better adapted to prey defence than others. We compared the capture and defence efficiency in three spider species that differ in their level of myrmecophagy. We used three ant species differing in body size and aggression in a functional response experimental set-up that measured capture frequency at different prey densities. We found a type 4, dome-shaped functional response, and we propose a new mechanistic model to describe this type. Estimated parameters (searching efficiency, handling time, inhibition by prey) were then compared among spider and ant species to quantify density-dependent defensive effects on the predator's capture efficiency. We also compared survival of spiders during experiments. We found that myrmecophagous Zodarion spiders hunted ants with the highest capture efficiency and had the highest survival, suggesting that these spiders are adapted to living with high densities of ants. Polyphagous Xysticus spiders captured ants with lower efficiency and had the lowest survival, indicating that these spiders are adapted to the capture of solitary ant workers. Polyphagous nonanteating Pardosa spiders did not capture ants but had high survival, and are apparently adapted to living with high densities of ants. The new proposed model of the type 4 functional response can be applied to other predator-prey systems in which the prey is dangerous and a decrease in predator hunting has a similar dependence on prey density.

AB In cooperative breeders, where nonparents participate in brood care, the investment of contributors to offspring care is predicted to be interdependent, reflecting a conflict of fitness interests between care providers. We experimentally manipulated the alloparental care of subordinate helpers in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher to test whether breeders compensate for reduced help, or whether brood care is additive. As predicted by recent theoretical models, breeder females only partially compensated for the reduced help of the subordinate by increasing their brood care effort. After being prevented from contributing to brood care, subordinates increased their brood care effort to a level exceeding that shown before the manipulation. Although this increased effort of helpers reduced the dominant female's workload, the clutch received more care in total post manipulation than during manipulation and before, that is, the brood care response was additive. These experimental results show that load-lightening effects and negotiation over brood care trigger behavioural decisions of dominants and subordinates, as suggested by a recent theoretical model. Together with previous evidence from birds, our results suggest that load lightening is taxonomically widespread in cooperative breeders. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Affiliative interactions have important fitness consequences for individuals. Yet, precisely how social roles emerge across ontogeny outside of the context of agonistic interactions is largely unknown, particularly in free-living species of nonprimates. Here we used longitudinal data on yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, residing around the Rocky Mountain Biology Laboratory in Colorado, U.S.A., to investigate the development of social partner choice in free-living rodents. We first characterized the symmetry of affiliative interactions between mother-offspring pairs and within cohorts of individuals as they developed across discrete life history stages. Affiliative behaviours generally increased in symmetry such that exchanges became more reciprocal as individuals matured. We then evaluated the extent to which individuals biased their affiliative behaviour towards, and agonistic behaviour away from, genetic relatives. As predicted by kin selection theory, rates of affiliation increased with the degree of relatedness among individuals at all three life history stages. Thus, nepotism emerged within cohorts of newly weaned pups and persisted into adulthood despite prolonged annual separations due to hibernation. Surprisingly, close relatives also exchanged the highest rates of agonistic behaviour. After accounting for the degree of relatedness, rates of affiliative behaviours given and agonistic behaviours received remained positively correlated, suggesting that close affiliates are each other's closest competitors. Thus, although reciprocity of affiliative exchanges within cohorts increased as individuals matured, competition among genetic relatives emerged early in ontogeny and persisted into adulthood. Taken together, these results highlight changes in social roles shown by individuals across ontogeny and shed light on theories of life history and social evolution.

AB Many primates share food, but the motives behind this food sharing are mostly not known. We investigated individuals' preference to feed either alone or together with a tolerant partner. Subjects (chimpanzees who are highly competitive around food, bonobos who are more tolerant around food and common marmosets who are cooperative breeders and share food actively with some partners) were tested with a door-opening paradigm. In a 2 x 2 design with the factors 'food' and 'partner', subjects had the opportunity to eat piles of sharable food, if present, and/or to open the door, thereby allowing the partner, if present, to join the subject. While food had a main effect on the subject's behaviour, the presence of the partner did not. Individuals of all species opened the door much more often if there was no food available. These results suggest that regardless of their differing social organizations, chimpanzees, bonobos and marmosets do not voluntarily co-feed, but do not mind having company if there is no food present.

AB Social bees are known to avoid inflorescences marked with dead conspecifics or their smell. The avoidance response could be triggered by alarm signals actively given by attacked bees or by substances passively released through injuries as a by-product of the attack. To discriminate between these two options we note that both social and solitary bees are expected to react to nonsignalling cues associated with predation risk, while only social bees are expected to give alarm signals. We simulated risky inflorescences by pinching a landing bee with forceps, and compared the rate at which bees visited these experimental inflorescences and unmanipulated control inflorescences. We conducted the experiment with four species of social bees, Apis mellifera, Apis dorsata, Apis florea and Bombus terrestris and with three species of solitary bees, Eucera sp., Panurgus sp. and Nomia strigata. We found that while the three species of solitary bees responded similarly to control and experimental inflorescences, all four species of social bees strongly rejected inflorescences where we simulated a predation attempt. The finding that only social species avoided landing on dangerous inflorescences strongly suggests that the release of the alarm cue has been selected for its signalling value in social bees.

AB A social group's time budget is an emergent property of individual-level decisions about how to allocate time. One fundamental determinant of these time allocation decisions is foraging success. Yet while there is a growing appreciation of how social animals optimize their foraging behaviour, our understanding of the mechanisms that link this behaviour with individual time use, and thus group-level time budgets, is relatively poor. In this review, we explore the current understanding of social foraging behaviour and time budgets at the individual level and emergent group-level time budgets. We highlight how research into individual-level differences in time budgets is comparably limited. We then explore how individual-based mechanistic modelling may provide a useful tool for elucidating how social foraging behaviour drives individual time budget patterns, and how these patterns in turn give rise to group-level time budgets. An improved understanding of the links between these three phenomena will not only allow us to address more challenging evolutionary questions, but also enable us to better predict and manage the impacts of a changing environment on social animals in the future.

AB Insect location and utilization of a resource is influenced by a host of variables including nutrients acquired prior to encountering a stimulus and age of the individual. For the carrion system, we hypothesized that volatiles to which primary colonizers, such as blow flies, respond are the same signalling molecules produced and utilized for quorum sensing by bacteria found on the resource. We provided freshly emerged blow flies, Lucilia sericata, different diets (blood or powdered milk) and assessed their behaviour in a dual-choice assay based on sex and ovarian status of 7-day-old or 14-day-old adults. We determined their preference between wild-type Proteus mirabilis, which is able to swarm (a quorum-sensing response), or mutated (by transposon mutagenesis) P. mirabilis, which is unable to swarm. In most instances, an individual's sex did not significantly influence its response. Age and diet appeared to regulate fly motivation and preference. Seven-day-old flies had a significantly greater probability of responding to the wild type than to the mutant, regardless of diet, but the percentage of milk-fed flies that responded was significantly smaller (85% less) than the percentage of blood-fed flies that responded. Blood-fed flies oviposited, whereas milk-fed flies did not. Seven-day-old flies oviposited predominately on the wild type, whereas 14-day-old flies oviposited predominately on the mutant. Our results demonstrate that the mechanism used by L. sericata for detecting a resource can be associated with bacterial quorum sensing, and that the physiological state of the insect influences its response. We also identified several differences in volatile compounds produced by the bacteria that could explain blow fly response. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Parent birds respond to a variety of cues from their offspring when provisioning them with food. Bright flange colours and large body size are two traits of offspring that many parents seem to favour, but little is known about how such traits interact. By experimentally altering the difference in mass between nestmates while concurrently blackening the flanges of either the large or small nestlings in the brood, we tested whether large body size could compensate for dull coloration. In three species of cavity nesters (northern flicker, Colaptes auratus, great tit, Parus major, and pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca), doubly disadvantaged offspring that were both small and dull performed the worst, whereas large and bright offspring received the most provisioning, consistent with the idea of additive effects. We used regression to show that, for flickers, dull (blackened) nestlings performed as well as bright nestlings when they were 20% larger than their bright nestmates. For passerines, dull nestlings had to be 30-40% larger than bright nestlings to receive equivalent amounts of food from parents. Within-brood differences in mass before manipulation were often greater than this size difference threshold, suggesting that hatching asynchrony has a stronger influence on food allocation than do colour differences among siblings.

AB There is a divergence between models examining the evolution of group living in species in which groups are largely based on families and those based on fluid aggregations of nonrelatives. In the former, the onus has been on ecological and demographic factors that select for offspring philopatry; in the latter, the importance of factors such as foraging success and predation risk are more typically emphasized. We examined the association between predation risk and both group size and foraging behaviour in the chestnut-crowned babbler, Pomatostomus ruficeps, a family-living cooperatively breeding bird that does not appear to face classic ecological or demographic constraints on dispersal and breeding. Groups were more likely to encounter, and be attacked by, avian predators when dependent young were present. Large groups were also more likely to encounter a predator, but less likely to be attacked by it, consistent with a benefit of group living through early predator detection or confusion effects. In addition, the average risk of predation for a given individual was reduced in large groups compared to small ones, owing to the dilution effect. That predation might partly select for group living in this species is boosted by findings showing reductions in ground foraging and increases in sentinel behaviour when predation risk was higher. We conclude that predation might represent an important force selecting for sociality in chestnut-crowned babblers, and highlight the need for future studies to consider more explicitly inherent benefits to group living in the evolution of vertebrate cooperative breeding systems. 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Despite their large relative brain size, bears have been neglected in studies of comparative cognition in comparison to their fellow carnivores, the social canines and pinnipeds. Here, three captive adult American black bears were presented with a series of natural concept discrimination tasks on a touchscreen computer, in which the discriminations varied in degree of abstraction. The more abstract discriminations could not be performed by attending to perceptual features of the stimuli alone. For instance, at the most abstract level, the bears were required to select images of animals rather than nonanimals, and exemplars within both categories were perceptually diverse. At least one bear performed at above-chance levels with transfer to novel images at each level of abstraction. The bear that began testing with the most abstract problems showed the best transfer on more abstract discriminations, suggesting that the usual practice of overtraining animals on perceptual discriminations may hinder their ability to acquire concepts at more abstract levels. The bears' performance suggests that a generalized diet may be more critical than group living with regard to the evolution of complex cognition in carnivores.

AB Physical strength and resource value are two key determinants of fighting success in most species. We investigated the role that resource value plays in determining fight outcome for a territory centred on a burrow in a fiddler crab, Uca annulipes. Males fought harder (escalated fights) for a territory during the mating period (when the burrow is also used for mating and breeding) than in the nonmating period (when it has value as a shelter). In both periods, having a burrow also allows access to the surrounding mudflat surface, where crabs forage. We confirmed earlier studies showing that males with regenerated claws are weaker competitors that are disproportionately evicted from their burrow during the nonmating period. Unexpectedly, however, males with a regenerated claw were not disproportionately evicted during the mating period. Fights at this time were also more escalated. We suggest this is because, when the disputed resource is also required for breeding, even weak males need to obtain and defend a burrow if they are to accrue any fitness. During the mating period, individuals with low resource-holding potential can improve their chances of mating if they escalate fights for burrows.

AB Social parasites exploit complete societies, on which they are dependent. In ants, slave-making species invade, exploit and raid host colonies, impacting their survival and exerting powerful selection pressure on their host species. Recent studies suggest that host ant species may develop a parasite brood intolerance, which could be the first step of a slave rebellion in parasitized colonies. However, enslaved workers of slave-making ants not only raise and feed their parasites, but also accept alien conspecific brood brought during seasonal raids. We compared the agonistic and grooming behaviour (a sign of brood integration) of two sympatric nonhost species (one showing intraspecific parasitism) and of enslaved and free-living host species confronted with alien conspecific worker pupae to assess whether parasite pressure could have decreased brood tolerance in host species. Free-living colonies of species suffering from interspecific or intraspecific parasitism were more aggressive and performed less grooming towards alien conspecific brood than colonies of nonhost species. Moreover, slave workers were not more aggressive towards alien parasites than towards alien conspecific brood but groomed alien parasites more than alien conspecific brood. We discuss how host-parasite coevolution could impact the social recognition mechanisms in host species. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Social individuals require a suite of skills to outcompete groupmates and gain reproductive advantage. Recently we showed that adult male cowbirds (Molothrus ater) exposed to enhanced social-learning opportunities (living in 'dynamic' social conditions) became more reproductively successful than males living in 'stable' conditions (White et al. 2010a, Animal Behaviour, 79, 385-390). The experiment left open important questions about how subjects turned the experiences they gained in the dynamic condition into a reproductive advantage. Here, 1 year later, we examined the within-individual plasticity of the effect by exposing some of the same subjects to opposite social conditions, followed by another opportunity to measure their relative reproductive success. Again, dynamic-condition birds outcompeted stable-condition birds, reversing individuals' performances from the year before. We investigated the constituents of the dynamic-condition birds' advantage, and found that they succeeded by using aggression to increase dominance rank, and by focusing courtship singing on forming consortships with particular females. Stable-condition birds adhered to no discernible strategy. This work affirms that adult experience can modify reproductive success, and suggests a mechanism for that modification: individuals that experience a wider array of social environments may improve their 'behavioural control', the ability to modulate behaviour to suit the competitive context. Natural selection may act on groups of traits that facilitate the development of behavioural control, including faculties for expressing or inhibiting behaviours and traits that regulate individuals' exposure and attention to social experience.

AB Reproductive signalling often involves multimodal signals that are sent between conspecifics. While it is often easier to study one sensory modality at a time, examining multiple sensory modalities together may lead to a fuller understanding of how sensory signals are integrated under natural conditions. Often when integration occurs, behavioural responses are modified compared to those that occur in response to one sensory modality. We exposed female round gobies, Neogobius melanostomus, to a reproductive male's call and to extracts of water conditioned by a reproductive male (chemical stimulus) separately and simultaneously to examine differences between the females' unimodal and multimodal responses to male stimuli. We also tested females across the breeding season to examine effects of reproductive status on female responsiveness. Reproductive females were attracted to the unimodal stimuli, but when they were presented with multimodal stimuli, they spent significantly more time in the area of stimulus presentation than they did when they were presented with either stimulus alone. Nonreproductive females showed no enhancement of their response to multimodal stimulation and often failed to respond to any signals. Our results show that female gobies may cycle in their attraction and localization abilities to male stimuli throughout the breeding season and that reproductive females have a synergistic response to multimodal stimuli from reproductive males.

AB Male courtship behaviour is known to correlate with body condition and other aspects of male phenotypic or genetic quality. Females often prefer males that express the most intense or elaborate displays, although recent findings indicate that this should not always be the case; males may be strategic in their courtship displays, signal dishonestly or deplete their energy reserves with intense courting. To study reliability of courtship effort as a mate choice signal, I assessed multiple aspects of male courtship using wild-caught sand gobies, Pomatoschistus minutus, in a controlled laboratory setting. I found consistent and repeatable between-male differences in courtship. However, females did not show a significant preference for males that courted intensively. Furthermore, other assessed male traits with a previously demonstrated role in sexual selection were not correlated with courtship effort. This indicates that courtship displays did not reliably signal male quality. The results also suggest that even when courtship has potential to convey useful information, females may have to trade between courtship and other cues they use in mate choice. Hence, to gain a more complete understanding of the selection regime acting on male courtship behaviour, and female preference for it, one should simultaneously investigate multiple factors that can affect female mating behaviour.

AB We examined depth preference in adult zebrafish in a modified visual cliff apparatus, in which distance from the water surface and distance from the substrate could be independently manipulated. In one condition, when the two sides of the apparatus genuinely differed in depth, subjects showed a powerful preference for the deeper side. In another condition, both sides of the tank were set to the same depth using a glass insert, but one side was made to appear deeper by placing gravel substrate just below the glass floor on one side, and far below the glass floor on the other, in an analogue of the visual cliff paradigm. Although terrestrial animals tend to avoid the 'deeper'-looking side of a visual cliff apparatus, zebrafish preferred the side that appeared deeper. They showed no preference for the side in which they could be closer to the gravel substrate. This effect appeared whether or not the gravel represented a novel stimulus for the fish. We conclude that escape from the surface, rather than approach to the substrate, motivates the diving response in zebrafish. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Kin recognition, defined as the ability to differentiate genetically related from unrelated individuals, plays a key role in a range of biological processes, from mate choice to altruistic behaviours, but kin-based altruism may be overridden by competition for resources. We explored kin recognition in a gregarious parasitoid wasp, Goniozus legneri, in which adult female-female contests for hosts occur. Contest behaviour was less aggressive when competitors were more closely related and also when females had developed on the same host (in nature, broodmates will almost always be siblings). Goniozus legneri appears to be the only parasitoid species utilizing both genetically based (phenotype matching) and environmentally based (familiarity) mechanisms of phenotypic kin discrimination. While perceived resource value affects aggression in Goniozus, resource competition did not completely override kin recognition effects. Crown Copyright (C) 2012.

AB A surprising finding in comparative social cognition is that great apes seem to have difficulties understanding others' communicative behaviour. In no other paradigm is this more evident than in the object-choice task in which subjects use a human cue, such as pointing, to infer the correct choice of a reward hidden in one of a number of containers. Apes often perform poorly in the task whereas many other species succeed. One popular explanation for this finding is that apes have not evolved the propensity to understand others' communicative behaviour because their social systems are based predominantly on competitive relationships. We caution against this hypothesis by highlighting recent experimental evidence that suggests methodological factors are responsible for the apes' poor performance in object-choice studies. Furthermore, we compared the methodology and results of 63 published object-choice studies in a range of animal taxa. We found that the central object-choice method that is only used with apes and other primates typically results in failure. When, however, modifications are made to this method or apes are tested with a peripheral method that is similar to the one used with many other species, their performance vastly improves. We discuss the significance of this in relation to past object-choice research and make several recommendations as to how future research can be improved upon so that apes are tested in a manner comparable to the testing of other animal species.

AB Third-party interventions are defined as the interruption of dyadic interactions by third animals through direct physical contact, interposing or threats. Previous studies focused on the analysis of interventions against agonistic encounters. However, there have been no evaluations of interventions against affiliative behaviours, particularly in relation to the intervening animal's social relationships and its social and spatial position. Horses, Equus caballus, are an interesting model species, as interventions against affiliative interactions occur more frequently than against agonistic interactions. In this study, 64 feral horses displayed 67 interventions in affiliative interactions and eight interventions in agonistic interactions within the observation period. We analysed the interventions in affiliative encounters, and found that it was mainly higher-ranking females that intervened in the affiliative interactions of group mates in the stable horse harems. The intervening animals took an active part in affiliative and agonistic encounters within the group, but did not occupy particular social roles or spatial positions. They intervened in affiliative interactions in which group mates with which they had social bonds interacted with other members of the group. They targeted the nonbonded animal and approached the one with which they were socially bonded. We suggest some species use third-party interventions in affiliative interactions to prevent competition for preferred social interaction partners from escalating into more costly agonistic encounters.

AB Many animals produce alarm calls that warn conspecifics about predators. In some species, alarm calls communicate continuous traits associated with a predator encounter, such as its level of threat. In other species, alarm calls communicate categorical traits, such as predator class (e.g. avian versus terrestrial), and are consequently considered functionally referential. In theory, functionally referential alarm calls can simultaneously communicate continuously distributed traits, though examples of such calls are rare. Such dual-function calls could be adaptive because they would enable receivers to tailor their responses to a specific predator class, as well as to more subtle characteristics of individual attacks. Here, we tested whether male fowl (Gallus gallus) communicate continuous variation in avian stimuli through graded structure in their functionally referential aerial alarm calls. In the first experiment, we held male fowl in an indoor test cage and allowed them to view wild birds flying past a window. We recorded their alarm calls and compared the structure to the size, speed, and proximity of the eliciting stimuli. Stimuli that appeared closer, larger, and faster elicited alarm calls that were shorter, louder, clearer, and lower in frequency. In the second experiment, we broadcast alarm calls to foraging females and compared their responses to the graded structural changes documented earlier. Females exhibited greater initial responses and finished feeding later in response to louder alarm calls. Together, these results show that fowl communicate the size, speed and proximity of avian stimuli through graded variation in their functionally referential aerial alarm calls.

AB Spix's disc-winged bats, Thyroptera tricolor, form small, long-term social groups in which members are loyal to a patch of forest but move on a daily basis between highly ephemeral roosting sites (partly unfurled Heliconia leaves). This species has been shown to exchange social calls that facilitate contact with nearby bats and recruitment to roost sites. During flight, T. tricolor emits 'inquiry' calls that frequently elicit a response from individuals that have already entered a furled leaf. These 'response' calls are then followed by the flying bat entering the occupied leaf roost. In this study, we examined variation in the structure of inquiry and response calls, and assessed whether calls encode information about individual or group identity that would allow for acoustic discrimination to occur. We found that both inquiry and response calls were sufficiently consistent within individuals, and divergent between individuals, to permit separation of individual bats based on call structure. We also found some evidence for group-specific signatures, although these were less defined than differences observed between individuals. While this does not confirm that Spix's disc-winged bats can discriminate between individuals and groups based on call information, our results indicate that both call types have a broad enough parameter space for this to occur.

AB Bioluminescent flashing in fireflies, while primarily a sexual signal, is known to deter some predators while attracting others. We tested whether flashing serves an antipredator function against two species of diurnal, visually hunting jumping spiders, Phidippus princeps and Phidippus audax. To confirm anecdotal reports that fireflies flash during the day in a nonmating context, we documented that adult fireflies (Photuris sp.) of both sexes flash when disturbed in daylight. We also confirmed that activity periods of Phidippus and fireflies overlap, and that spiders attack fireflies and elicit flashing behaviour. We conducted three experiments to examine the influence of flashing on spider behaviour. (1) We tested whether the sudden onset of a flashing LED startled spiders that had initiated attacks on crickets, and found no evidence that it did so. (2) We used choice tests to determine whether flashing lights attracted or deterred spiders from attacking palatable prey. Spiders more often attacked crickets positioned next to a flashing LED versus an LED that was either off or glowed steadily. (3) Many firefly species are distasteful. Therefore, we tested whether flashing lights facilitate avoidance of unpalatable prey with experience. Spiders were given seven encounters with unpalatable prey (nonluminescent Ellychnia corrusca fireflies) associated with either flashing or unlit LEDs. Spiders in the two treatments were equally likely to attack the prey during their first encounter, but spiders exposed to flashing LEDs were significantly less likely to attack unpalatable prey by their seventh trial. Spiders tested with palatable prey showed no decline in attacks after exposure to flashing LEDs. We conclude that, although bioluminescent flash signals may increase attack rates by predatory jumping spiders, they may also facilitate learning about unpalatable prey. Thus, the costs and benefits of flashing may depend on the prevalence of firefly palatability. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Host feeding is common among synovigenic parasitoid wasps and is the mechanism through which they obtain nutrients for egg production. Upon host discovery, female wasps make a series of decisions that influence their host feeding and oviposition activities. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that host availability is one of the factors that may affect these decisions. Diglyphus isaea, a synovigenic ectoparasitic wasp, parasitizes and kills (by feeding on or stinging) larval stages of agromyzid leafminer flies. We found that in the presence of large populations of adult leafminer flies, Liriomyza trifolii, the parasitoid wasp increased its host-killing behaviour, which appeared to be associated with a trend for increased protein uptake. Our study suggests that anticipated future host availability, which is based on a 'host cue detour' (sensu 'infochemical detour'), affects the host-killing and host-feeding behaviour of this parasitoid wasp.

AB Fishes in the superorder Ostariophysi have excellent hearing due to the presence of a synapomorphic hearing specialization called the Weberian apparatus. This structure connects the swim bladder to the inner ear, and increases both sensitivity and upper hearing range. Although numerous experiments have tested the effects of the Weberian apparatus on hearing, few have provided potential evidence for a current adaptive function for the specialization. We conducted a field-based experiment in which a rock shuffling noise and a white noise were played simultaneously from adjacent speakers in a clear, mountain stream in the southern Appalachian Mountains, U.S.A. Our results indicate that species of Cyprinidae, a family within Ostariophysi, were attracted more to rock shuffling noise than to the white noise. This study provides the first evidence that a broadband environmental sound associated with a potential food source is utilized by a potentially large number of species possessing a hearing specialization.

AB In many animal species, males engage in endurance rivalry, competing for mating opportunites over extended durations. In the rhesus macaque, a seasonally breeding primate species, energetically costly mating behaviours such as consortship lead to greater reproductive success, and the ability of males to improve their body condition before the mating season may be crucial in determining their ability to use such strategies. Here, we explore relationships between male dominance rank, behaviour, body mass index (BMI) and energetics (assessed through urinary C-peptide of insulin levels, UCPs) in free-ranging rhesus macaques during a 6-month birth season and subsequent 6-month mating season. We analysed measures of general activity, mating behaviours and restlessness, here defined as the rate of change between behaviours. During the birth season, high-ranking males spent more time feeding on high-energy food, were less restless and spent less time travelling than low-ranking males. Restlessness and travelling time were both negatively correlated with male BMI and UCPs. Males in good condition during the birth season were in good condition at the onset of the mating season. During the mating season, high-ranking males participated in more consortships, which were positively correlated with copulatory activity. Copulation was negatively correlated with UCP levels, demonstrating the cost of such mating activities. As a consequence, by the end of the mating season, high-ranking males were in the worst condition. Our results suggest that male rhesus macaques engage in competitive endurance rivalry, and that male condition built during the previous birth season is an integral part of mating success.

AB Documentation of predator attacks in nature is important for understanding how specific antipredator defences have evolved, but previous accounts have been mostly anecdotal. Therefore, we monitored predation on two closely related butterfly species, Aglais urticae and Inachis io, during winter hibernation. Butterflies were placed singly close to the floor on walls in dark, seminatural hibernation sites (e. g. unheated outhouses). We used motion-initiated infrared-sensitive cameras to record predator attacks on the butterflies. The antipredator attributes of the two species have two characteristics: during rest the butterflies reduce predators' attention by mimicking leaves but they can suddenly change their guise by repeatedly flicking their wings. The wing flicking also produces hissing sounds and ultrasonic clicks and, furthermore, I. io, but not A. urticae, have large eyespots on the dorsal wing surface. The two butterfly species suffer from mouse predation during the winter and mice have been suggested as potential targets for the butterflies' sound production. Results showed that (1) mice (Apodemus spp.) were important predators on butterflies, (2) I. io often survived attacks by wing-flicking behaviour, and (3) both species moved to less accessible positions after interactions with mice and other small mammalian predators, but I. io more often so. The successful predator evasion in darkness by I. io suggests a multimodal defence; in addition to the large eyespots, which intimidate birds, we suggest that the hissing and/or click sounds produced during wing flicking may have evolved as defence against rodent attacks.

AB Status signals are thought to reduce the potential costs of social conflict over resources by advertising social status to other group members and reducing unnecessary contests between individuals of differing abilities. Nearly all studies of status signals to date have focused on single signalling traits, and most studies that have investigated multiple traits did not examine whether different traits are used in different contexts, as is required for them to function as multiple signals. We examined the role of gold and black crown patches of wintering golden-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia atricapilla, in determining social dominance during experimentally staged encounters between unfamiliar individuals. Specifically, we determined whether variation in weakly correlated or uncorrelated traits (crown patch size and colour, body size) differentially affected the outcome of interactions involving avoidance versus aggression. Overall, crown patch size and colour were better predictors of dominance than were body size or sex. Several traits, including both crown features and morphological traits, predicted which individual avoided the other in dyadic interactions that did not escalate beyond avoidance. However, when dyads had similar gold crown patch sizes, the interaction was more likely to escalate, leading to aggression. In contrast to avoidance interactions, the outcomes of aggressive contests were largely predicted by variation in the colour of black crown patches. Taken together, our results show that gold and black crown features operate as multiple status signals that accommodate an escalated gradient of interactions and suggest that social status involves more complexity than can be accommodated by a single signal.

AB Various environmental and social factors can bias who wins and who loses a fight, but less is known about how these factors interact with each other to affect contest outcome. We examined this issue in the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, as males of this species illustrate great flexibility in aggressive and territorial tactics in the field and in the laboratory. We found that the effects of both residency status and resource abundance (food, water and cover from predators) increased winning ability; however, there was no interaction between these two effects. As such, the impacts of residency and resource abundance on winning might represent two distinct behavioural phenomena that manifest via different mechanisms. We also found that mice that urine-marked an open arena at a high frequency were more likely to win fights in resource-rich environments compared to resource-poor environments. Meanwhile, mice that urine-marked the same type of environment at a substantially lower frequency did not show this behavioural difference between contexts. Because urinary marking behaviour is allied with aspects of risk-taking behaviour and social status, this result implies that males integrate information about their relative 'boldness' with information from their environment to make context-appropriate tactical decisions about fighting. We speculate that our data illustrate real-time, decision-making processes that are a necessary component of conditional strategies used to optimize fitness.

AB Many food-caching animals live in groups and cache pilferage may be one of the negative consequences of social living. Several hypotheses have been proposed to suggest that individuals may benefit from caching even when cache pilferage is high if all individuals can cache and pilfer equally. Stable groups may hypothetically support the evolution of such 'reciprocal pilfering' because all group members may potentially have numerous opportunities to pilfer each other's caches. If that were the case, then we would expect animals to cache openly in front of their group members, but to avoid caching in direct view of unknown conspecifics. We tested this hypothesis by allowing mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, to cache food in three experimental conditions: (1) with a familiar observer from the same group and an unfamiliar conspecific observer; (2) with a familiar observer from the same group only and (3) without any observers. When presented with both a familiar and an unfamiliar observer, the caching chickadees treated both observers equally by choosing caching sites that were both farther away and out of sight of both observers. When only the familiar observer was present, chickadees shifted their choice of caching sites to the surfaces both away from and out of sight of the observer. When no observers were present, all available caching sites were used equally. Our results thus do not support the reciprocal cache sharing hypothesis and suggest that chickadees try to minimize cache pilferage from both familiar group members and unfamiliar conspecifics.

AB The human auditory system perceptually restores short deleted segments of speech and other sounds ( e. g. tones) when the resulting silent gaps are filled by a potential masking noise. When this phenomenon, known as 'auditory induction', occurs, listeners experience the illusion of hearing an ongoing sound continuing through the interrupting noise even though the perceived sound is not physically present. Such illusions suggest that a key function of the auditory system is to allow listeners to perceive complete auditory objects with incomplete acoustic information, as may often be the case in multisource acoustic environments. At present, however, we know little about the possible functions of auditory induction in the sound-mediated behaviours of animals. The present study used two-choice phonotaxis experiments to test the hypothesis that female grey treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis, experience the illusory perceptual restoration of discrete pulses in the male advertisement call when pulses are deleted and replaced by a potential masking noise. While added noise restored some attractiveness to calls with missing pulses, there was little evidence to suggest that the frogs actually experienced the illusion of perceiving the missing pulses. Instead, the added noise appeared to function as an acoustic appendage that made some calls more attractive than others as a result of sensory biases, the expression of which depended on the temporal order and acoustic structure of the added appendages.

AB The traditional view of sexual selection has been that of competing males and choosy females; however, more recently it has been recognized that males may exhibit mate choice when females vary in quality and when males suffer costs associated with mating. Sexually cannibalistic mating systems provide an opportunity to examine male mate choice further: the high costs potentially involved in the mating process for males, as well as variation in female quality, predict male mate choice. We used the praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata to determine the effect of female body condition on male mate choice in a system with frequent precopulatory sexual cannibalism. Female body condition is positively correlated with fecundity and negatively correlated with the propensity to cannibalize, so we predicted males would strongly prefer females in good condition to maximize their reproductive potential. Results of our simultaneous choice tests showed that males use chemical and visual cues for mate location and assessment, and that they can use either of these sensory modalities to distinguish and choose between females differing in body condition, with a significant preference for good-condition females. However, surprisingly, males rarely rejected poor-condition females in the more ecologically relevant scenario of only one immediate potential mate and both sensory modes available to them, which may be explained by the strong scramble competition known for praying mantid systems. These results show that even when female quality varies and the cost of mating for males is substantial, male mate rejection does not always evolve. Crown Copyright (C) 2010.

ID BEHAVIOR; RANKING
AB A plethora of indices have been proposed and used to construct dominance hierarchies in a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate societies, although the rationale for choosing a particular index for a particular species is seldom explained. In this study, we analysed and compared three such indices, viz Clutton-Brock et al.'s index (CBI), originally developed for red deer, Cervus elaphus, David's score (DS) originally proposed by the statistician H. A. David and the frequency-based index of dominance (FDI) developed and routinely used by our group for the primitively eusocial wasps Ropalidia marginata and Ropalidia cyathiformis. Dominance ranks attributed by all three indices were strongly and positively correlated for both natural data sets from the wasp colonies and for artificial data sets generated for the purpose. However, the indices differed in their ability to yield unique (untied) ranks in the natural data sets. This appears to be caused by the presence of noninteracting individuals and reversals in the direction of dominance in some of the pairs in the natural data sets. This was confirmed by creating additional artificial data sets with noninteracting individuals and with reversals. Based on the criterion of yielding the largest proportion of unique ranks, we found that FDI is best suited for societies such as the wasps belonging to Ropalidia, DS is best suited for societies with reversals and CBI remains a suitable index for societies such as red deer in which multiple interactions are uncommon.

AB Social bonds between conspecifics (sexual pairmates, parent-infant or siblings) and social motivation can influence the way birds interact. Social bonds between familiar conspecifics may also be formed, especially in chicks from precocial species in which behaviour is characterized by a strong social attraction. We investigated the establishment of such a bond and the effect of social motivation using a separation/reunion test in 1-week-old Japanese quail. In experiment 1, the behaviour of paired quail selected for high (HSR) or low (LSR) social reinstatement behaviour was recorded during three successive 10 min situations: baseline, separation and return of the cagemate. Both lines showed behavioural changes during social separation but the distress response was higher in the HSR line. Return of the familiar cagemate induced a return to baseline activity in both lines. The specificity of this response was tested in experiment 2 in which paired quail of both lines were separated, and their behavioural and vocal responses to the introduction of the familiar or an unfamiliar bird were compared. LSR chicks responded differently both behaviourally and vocally according to the familiarity of the introduced bird, whereas the response of HSR chicks differed only for aggressive pecks. HSR quail chicks thus revealed a nonspecific social attraction for conspecifics, whereas LSR chicks showed a bond with the cagemate. Our results highlight the importance of vocal communication as an indicator of the strength of the bond. Our findings show that high social motivation in quail chicks is not related to the development of a social bond. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A decade of research on domestic dogs' responsiveness to human actions has led some to believe that all members of the species Canis familiaris possess a human-like social cognition not shared by their nondomesticated relatives. However, comparative studies on diverse populations of domestic dog are lacking, making species-wide generalizations premature. In this study we present the performance of one under-represented population, stray dogs living in shelters, on a human-guided object-choice task. Unlike pet dogs, shelter dogs universally failed to follow a momentary distal point to a target location in initial tests, although they were able to follow a simpler form of human point on the same task. Furthermore, the majority of subjects learned to follow a momentary distal point to a target when given additional training trials (experiment 2). Dogs' sensitivity to human gestures may not be entirely explained by phylogenetic variables; rather, the interactions between genetic, developmental and experiential variables must be considered.

AB Vocal communication between parents and offspring, including feeding solicitations by parents and begging calls of young, can increase the risk of predation by attracting predators. Parents can use a 'switch-off' signal (alarm call) to suppress progeny vocalizations or movement, making chicks less detectable to predators. Alternatively, a 'switch-on' signal (feeding or solicitation call) may be used to initiate a begging display in young by parents. The presence and species specificity of either or both of these signals have rarely been tested, as acoustically similar cues may have evolved amongst avian species. We examined the behavioural and acoustic responses of individual grey warbler, Gerygone igata, nestlings to both feeding and alarm calls at 12 and 16 days of age (nestling period: 17 days) in a sound-isolation chamber. Overall, nestlings consistently reduced the amplitude of begging calls in response to alarm calls, regardless of the developmental stage. Nestlings responded by gaping only to conspecific, and not heterospecific, begging solicitation calls or other acoustic stimuli. After alarm calls, nestlings did not cease begging, but altered the structure of the begging call. Differences in several begging call acoustic structures were also detected between age groups. These patterns are consistent with a trade-off in chicks' signal-specific responses to parental calls, which optimizes the probability of being fed during parental nest visits whilst also reducing predator detection.

AB Individuals of the same species, sex, age and size may differ in suites of behaviour traits in a consistent manner across time and may thus represent different personalities. In a communication context, the personality of an individual may both affect and be affected by the behaviour of the individuals surrounding it within a network. We investigated the effects of a change of local social environment on two behavioural types, 'persistent' versus 'sporadic' signaller, in Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens. Males visually interacted for 1 day in a communication network of seven fish in tanks arranged in a hexagonal grid, while we recorded space use and signalling data. We then exchanged the positions of two males with different behavioural types and observed them interacting the following day. 'Persistent' signallers were unaffected by the treatment, while 'sporadic' signallers increased the time spent in the inner front part of their tank, from which they could observe but not interact with the neighbours. Social instability (i.e. number of changed neighbours) raised the signalling levels of individuals independently of their behavioural types. We discuss the relationship between information gathering in a communication network and network composition in terms of behavioural types of its members.

AB Rats, Rattus norvegicus, housed with 'environmental enrichment' do better in tests of spatial cognition than rats housed in barren cages. The leading hypothesis is that exposure to `social and inanimate complexity' leads to better cognitive-processing abilities, which directly enhances performance in a spatial task. However, enrichment is associated with reduced stress responses and anxiety in novel or acutely stressful situations (cognitive tasks are typically both). Therefore, a plausible alternative hypothesis is that experience of enrichment indirectly enhances performance by reducing a rat's anxiety levels during cognitive testing. We found that, irrespective of sex, enriched rats outperformed barren-housed rats in the Morris water maze. However, after accounting for the effects of thigmotaxis (a behavioural anxiety measure during testing), there was no significant difference in performance between enriched and barren-housed rats. Enriched rats were simply less thigmotactic and this indirectly improved their performance. This was true for both males and females. We conclude that enrichment reduces anxiety outside the home cage, in a cognitive test situation, and, subsequently, the cognitive benefits of enrichment occur because enriched animals are less anxious during cognitive testing.

AB According to the threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis, prey should match the intensity of their antipredation response to the degree of threat posed by predators. We used controlled indoor experiments to investigate the ability of red knots to discern between high- and low-threat encounters with a representative predator, the sparrowhawk. The behaviour of knots was compared across three conditions: no predators present (very low predation threat), presentation of a perching sparrowhawk model (low predation threat) and presentation of a gliding sparrowhawk model (high predation threat). In all behavioural parameters measured, red knots showed evidence of discriminating between the different levels of predation risk. Knots responded immediately to the presence of sparrowhawks with escape flights, and the duration of escape flights was longer following the gliding sparrowhawk events than following perching events. Similarly, the proportion of time spent vigilant increased with increasing level of predation threat, while the proportion of time spent feeding decreased. These results show that knots recognize variations in the level of predation threat, and adjust their antipredator responses accordingly. Furthermore, model sparrowhawks were introduced into the experimental arena at similar distances to the knots, which suggests that knots are able to use cues other than distance to predator to gauge the immediate level of threat that a predator poses.

   NUTRITION; BODY CONDITION; HONEST SIGNAL
AB Selection should favour female preferences for reliable signals of male quality when such preferences result in benefits to females. Research on bird song suggests that, because song is costly to produce or sustain, females are obtaining accurate information about male quality through song preferences. Females have been shown to express mating preferences for three general categories of costly song features: song output, song complexity and geographical variation. A novel mechanism for the reliability of song is suggested by constraints on the ability to produce rapid, broadband trills (i.e. 'vocal performance'). In several species of birds, females show a preference for superior vocal performance, supporting a key prediction of the hypothesis that vocal performance, like other features of song, may be a reliable indicator of male quality. In this study, I further test this hypothesis by investigating whether female swamp sparrows' preference for vocal performance is favoured by selection because it reliably reflects male quality. I found that vocal performance in male swamp sparrows was correlated with age and size, measured as mass. By preferring males with superior vocal performance, female swamp sparrows may obtain direct and indirect benefits by mating with older larger males. These results support the hypothesis that vocal performance in swamps sparrows is a reliable indicator of male quality. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ability to utilize contact calls to facilitate reunions with social partners has been documented in a number of species showing a fission/fusion social organization. Field observations and playback experiments suggest that African elephants use low-frequency rumble vocalizations to reunite with their herd members following periods of fission. Using a digital audio and GPS recording collar system, we documented the production of rumbles and subsequent movements of five adult female African elephants at Disney's Animal Kingdom, Bay Lake, Florida, U. S. A. This recording system allowed us to identify the producer of each rumble and to document the effect of rumbles on the movements of herd members relative to the caller. Our findings provide the first empirical evidence that spontaneously produced elephant rumble vocalizations function in part to mediate the spatial relationships of group members. Overall, the production of rumbles resulted in a net decrease in distance between the caller and her social partners. This approach behaviour was enhanced if the partner was highly affiliated with the caller, if the partner replied with a rumble of her own, and if the pair was initially far apart (>= 61 m). Rumble production was likely to result in avoidance behaviour only when there was no rumble reply by the partner and the dyad was close together prior to the initial call. These results suggest that a general function of elephant rumbles is to promote spatial cohesion among separated group members, but they may also mediate a variety of other close-distance social interactions.

AB Food sharing is widespread in animals and has received considerable attention because of its apparently altruistic nature. Sharing food includes different behaviours, notably offering food and co-feeding. In primates, food sharing between unrelated animals can largely be explained by reciprocity and harassment avoidance, while kin selection explains most instances of food sharing in cooperatively breeding birds. 'Costly signalling' has also been put forward as an explanation of food sharing in birds. A recent study on jackdaws, Corvus monedula, suggested that the costly signal of food sharing, notably offering food between juvenile birds, may play an essential role in the formation of pair bonds. We analysed food-sharing patterns in a group of juvenile rooks, Corvus frugilegus and found differences between the two modes of food sharing: offering food and co-feeding. Food offering was affected by dominance relationships and by gender, whereas co-feeding was reciprocated and occurred mainly between nestmates. We conclude that offering food and tolerating co-feeding have different functions in rooks: food offering acts as a costly signal directed to all members of the group whereas patterns of tolerating co-feeding were in line with both the reciprocity and pair-bonding hypotheses.

AB Studies of social rank in female ungulates consistently suggest that dominance increases with age, perhaps because dyadic relationships are established early in life, when the older female is always larger than the younger one. This relationship then remains unchanged, even if for fully grown adults size and age are not correlated, suggesting that typically female ungulates normally gain little from being dominant. In contrast, social interactions among 64 marked known-age bighorn sheep ewes (Ovis canadensis) over 3 summers at Ram Mountain, Alberta, Canada, suggest that the effect of age on social rank weakened substantially for ewes older than 6 years. Mass was strongly related to rank for ewes age 7 years and older, whereas horn size had no effect on dominance. Once they reach asymptotic mass, bighorn ewes appear to challenge older but lighter females to whom they were formerly subordinate. Although these results suggest that bighorn ewes may benefit from high social rank, we found no effect of rank on reproductive success, lamb sex ratio or lamb birth date.

AB We investigated the acoustical component of the recognition process leading to successful mother-pup reunions in the greater sac-winged bat, Saccopteryx bilineata, using both a statistical approach and playback experiments. Statistical evidence for individual distinctiveness was found in the isolation calls uttered by pups and, to a weaker degree, in the echolocation pulse trains emitted by mothers. In contrast to other bat species, isolation calls of S. bilineata pups were complex and multisyllabic, with most of the vocal signature information encoded in the composite syllables at the end of calls. Playback experiments with free-living bats revealed that mothers were able to discriminate between their own pup and an alien young on the basis of isolation calls alone, which confirms the results of the acoustical analysis on vocal signatures in isolation calls. Pups, on the other hand, indiscriminately vocalized in response to echolocation pulse trains from their own and alien mothers, rendering the motherepup recognition process unidirectional. The one-sidedness of the vocal recognition process in S. bilineata as well as in other bat species might be explained by a lack of selection pressures that shape mutual vocal parent-offspring recognition in other species of mammals and birds. To our knowledge, this study is the first in which playbacks were used to elicit antiphonal calling behaviour between bat mothers and pups experimentally. We argue that vocal responses to playback stimuli are a more feasible and reliable response measure for conducting mother-pup recognition playbacks in bats than the phonotaxis behaviour used in the past.

AB Synchrony is a phenomenon that is seen in several rhythmically signalling animals including fireflies,fiddler crabs (visual synchrony), frogs and katydids (acoustic synchrony). During acoustic interactions in katydids, synchrony is, however, imperfect and synchronous chirps typically lead or follow each other. In some katydid species, females have a strong preference for leading chirps, suggesting that consistent follower males would be at a disadvantage unless they used alternative strategies to attract females. In the katydid species Mecopoda 'Chirper' we used chirp period measurements to investigate whether individual males were consistent leaders and followers and whether followers could use three potentially advantageous strategies in field choruses: calling louder than leading males; spacing themselves such that they were either louder than leading males or were perceived to lead the leading males in some part of their acoustic range; and calling when leading males were silent. During acoustic interactions in choruses, three-fifths of the followers called more often when leaders were not calling. Leaders were, however, typically louder than followers but spacing enabled some quieter males to gain areas where they were the loudest among all males in a chorus. Chirp period and thus lead probability of males had low repeatability with no consistent leaders and followers across nights. Thus the disadvantage of being a follower in katydid choruses on a particular night could potentially be offset by solo calling or by the follower being a leader on other nights.

AB Multimale mating (MMM) is common in female mammals, but our understanding of its evolutionary significance in this taxon lags behind that in others (e.g. invertebrates and birds). To date, the majority of research on mammalian MMM has been conducted under laboratory conditions, and the extent to which these findings have relevance for natural populations is little known. We quantified MMM in a free-ranging population of North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, and investigated its hypothesized influences and consequences. We observed 85 mating chases, representing 62 individual females, over three mating seasons and calculated standardized indexes of MMM and number of copulations. Extrinsic elements of mating chases (i.e. an index of the number of attending males and date) explained variation in MMM, while traits of the females (age and pre-oestrous body mass) did not correlate with MMM. Hypotheses of cryptic direct benefit (fertility assurance and infanticide avoidance) were not supported because MMM did not influence pregnancy rate, litter size or nest fate. There was also no correlation between MMM and offspring quality, multiple paternity or litter allelic diversity, and therefore, no support for hypotheses of genetic benefit. In addition to not accruing observable benefits to MMM, females did not incur a detectable cost, thus rendering MMM selectively neutral. Rather, in line with traditional explanations, female mating behaviour in red squirrels appears to be a passive response to selection on multifemale mating in males.

AB The use of public information is an important component of breeding habitat selection in birds, especially for colonial species. In this way, individuals can reduce the costs of information acquisition, allowing them to make faster and better settlement decisions based on the quality of breeding sites. We studied the roles of two possible sources of public information on breeding habitat selection in the colonial lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni: number of conspecifics settled in the colony (`the social attraction hypothesis') and average brood size at fledging in the colony in the previous season (`the performance-based attraction hypothesis'). Furthermore, we analysed the time at which information is obtained. To attain this we used the rate of occupancy of the colony. We found that average number of. edglings raised in the colony, but not the number of conspecifics breeding the previous year, was correlated with the rate of occupancy, suggesting that public information on conspecific breeding performance may reveal habitat quality and determine colony selection by lesser kestrels. We also found that the number of conspecifics settled at the beginning of the current season did not determine the rate of occupancy of colonies at later stages. Overall, this study provides support for the performance-based attraction hypothesis but not for the social attraction hypothesis. These results may have important implications for management and conservation. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Much attention has focused on distinguishing between social and genetic monogamy in avian taxa. However, surprisingly few studies have directly investigated this distinction among mammals. We investigated the genetic mating system of the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster, a popular model for mammalian monogamy and human attachment. We used space use patterns to de. ne paired and single animals and assessed paternity using microsatellite loci. Prairie voles in this study engaged in significantly more extrapair fertilizations than predicted under genetic monogamy but fewer than predicted under random mating, demonstrating social but not genetic monogamy. Furthermore, we found that paired individuals were more likely to produce offspring than were unpaired individuals of either sex. This finding was true for both sexes and was attributable to differences in fertilization rates rather than litter sizes. Among mated individuals, however, faithful animals were no more successful than those that mated outside a pair. Taken together, our data demonstrate that paired prairie voles have greater breeding success than single voles, but such success is not contingent on mating exclusively with a social partner. If this species is to serve as a model for human love, our findings emphasize the need to distinguish between mammalian social attachment and sexual fidelity.

AB Gestures and facial displays are involved in regulating many aspects of mammal social life such as aggression, dominance-subordinate relationships, appeasement and play. Playful activity is an interesting behaviour for examining the role of signals as intentional communication systems. When animals play they perform patterns that are used in other serious contexts. To avoid miscommunication, many species have evolved signals to maintain a playful mood. Bonobos, Pan paniscus, with their flexible social relationships and playful propensity, may represent a good model species to test some hypotheses on adult play signalling. I analysed the potential roles of facial play expressions and solitary play in soliciting and regulating social play and found that adult bonobos used the play face (relaxed open-mouth display) in a selective manner. Play faces were more frequent during social than solitary play and, within social play, polyadic sessions (even though less frequent than dyadic sessions) were characterized by a higher frequency of signals following the rule of play intensity matching, play faces were more frequent when the two players matched in age and size (sessions among adults). Moreover, among dyads there was a positive correlation between the frequency of aggressive interactions performed and the frequency of play signals used, thus suggesting that signals are crucial in play negotiations among individuals showing high baseline levels of aggression finally, solitary play, especially when it involved pirouettes and somersaults, had an important role in triggering social play.

AB Behavioural deception has been studied experimentally primarily in captive-raised primates and corvids, and only in a laboratory setting. Here we show that free-living eastern grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, caching food in the presence of conspecifics perform behavioural deception by covering additional empty sites where nothing has been cached. Such deceptive caching (1) occurred in two distinct populations, (2) occurred more often in the close presence of conspecifics and (3) reduced the probability of cache pilferage by surrogate (human) cache pilferers. In an additional experiment, in which we attempted to elicit deceptive behaviour by pilfering caches, deceptive caching appeared as one behaviour in a suite of pilferage-avoidance responses. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show evidence of behavioural deception by a rodent, and the first to use an experimental approach to studying deceptive behaviour in the wild.

AB We obtained data on a cultural trait from an 8-year study of a bird species, the black-capped chickadee, Poecile atricapillus. The trait is a nonsong vocalization, the gargle call, which exhibits variant acoustic forms (memes) in local populations. Some forms persisted in the local population throughout the study period as traditions transmitted with high fidelity (core memes) and others (failed memes) appeared only briefly, destined for quick extinction. We used our data to test a number of hypotheses concerning the question of why some memes persist as traditions, whereas others are short lived. We found that the persisting core memes were more widely shared among individuals, more frequently expressed, and acoustically different from failed memes. Carriers of core memes were older on average than those expressing failed memes, and similar in body size, but greater in mass, a possible indication of condition. We hypothesize that social selection for conformity to core gargle memes occurs in the context of the agonistic encounters where these vocal signals are used.

ID FEMALE MATE CHOICE; SEXUAL SELECTION; CONSEQUENCES; PATTERNS; FISH
AB Variation among individuals in mate choice has important implications for the evolution of sexually selected traits. For example, it offers an explanation for the continued existence of heritable genetic variation in sexually selected male traits. In this study, we first tested the suitability of association tests for assessing female mate preferences in the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus. Sand goby females showed sexually motivated association preferences that were repeatable and corresponded to actual mating decisions. We then compared the correlation between the preferences of two different females presented to the same male pair with the correlation between preferences of single females tested twice. We found a weak correlation between preferences in the two-female treatment, while the correspondence between preferences was much higher for the single-female treatment. These results are in accordance with the possibility that sand goby females show genetically based, individual differences in mate preferences.

AB Reproductive skew theory provides a compelling explanation for the partitioning of reproduction among individuals within animal societies. One constructive criticism of the theory is that there are too many models, all of which have different assumptions and predictions, which makes it difficult to know what to test. Here we begin the process of tackling this problem, by re-examining the assumptions and predictions of basic concession and restraint models, two transactional models that are often tested as alternatives. Concession models assume that the dominant has complete control over the allocation of reproduction but may yield some of the group's reproduction to prevent the subordinate from voluntarily departing. Restraint models assume that the subordinate has complete control over the allocation of reproduction but may not claim all of the group's reproduction to prevent the dominant from forcibly evicting it. We show that the group dissolution tactics that individuals use ( forcible eviction or voluntary departure) need not be an assumption of the model, but rather they can be predicted using Hamilton's rule and the standard variables of skew models. We reveal that the assumption that one individual ( dominant or subordinate) has complete control over the allocation of reproduction is an idea common to both models, and we resolve this semantic difference by calling this individual 'the allocator'. We show that, regardless of the group dissolution tactics that individuals adopt, the allocator's share of the reproduction always increases as relatedness increases, as group productivity increases, and as constraints on leaving to breed elsewhere intensify. We conclude that concession and restraint type models make qualitatively similar predictions, and should not be tested as alternatives. In summary, this study makes the transactional framework of reproductive skew more general, by eliminating restrictive assumptions, and more amenable to testing in the field, by clarifying assumptions and predictions.

AB Each parent has limited resources to invest in current reproduction, so each parent would benefit if its mate did more of the work, which generates a sexual conflict between parents. Parental care behaviour is an adaptive decision, involving trade-offs between remating ( and consequently desertion of the brood) and continuing parental effort. The rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, is an unusual species in which brood desertion can occur in both sexes. Consequently, the rock sparrow is a good species to investigate the behavioural response of parents to the desertion by their mates and whether sexual difference in this response exists. We compared parental effort of pair members divided into three groups: pairs that cooperated, females that deserted the brood and males that deserted. During the period of biparental care, females fed offspring more often than males, but there were no differences among the three groups. Following desertion the total amount of care in biparental, female-only and male-only broods differed, because both sexes adjusted their care to the absence of their mates, but females overcompensated the mate's absence while males only partially compensated. Nestling survival rate was positively correlated with feeding rate and the mean survival rate was lower in the male-only broods. We suggest that both parents, in a negotiation process, would benefit from withholding parental investment, as proposed in recent theoretical models on sexual conflict over parental care. Altogether our results show an unexpected plastic response of parents to care during the desertion process.

AB Dominance hierarchies among pool-dwelling drift-feeding fish can determine spatial and temporal segregation of feeding territories. We tested the hypothesis that primarily nocturnal, dominant giant kokopu, Galaxias argenteus, force smaller, primarily diurnal, subordinate giant kokopu to feed by day. To test whether subordinate fish would become more nocturnal in the absence of dominant fish, we temporarily removed dominant fish from stream pools in which stable dominance hierarchies operated. Removal of the dominant fish resulted in a significant increase in the number of smaller giant kokopu active in stream pools at night; however, no change in activity was detected by day. The results indicate that large dominant fish control diel activity of subordinate fish, excluding them from stream pools at times (night) when invertebrate drift densities are at their highest.

AB Both male and female birds are known to eavesdrop on male-male vocal interactions. In contrast, males visually eavesdropping on male-male contests has been observed in fish but only suggested in birds and few avian studies have been done. We observed the behaviour of male domestic canaries, Serinus canaria, during competition for food with rivals they had or had not previously observed in dyadic contests. Males responded differentially to winners and losers of agonistic interactions they had witnessed, initiating fewer attacks against the winner and spending less time foraging. In contrast, no such effect was found when males had no prior knowledge of the relative competitive ability of the contestants. The domestic canary is, to our knowledge, the only species proven to use both visual and acoustic cues to eavesdrop. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Generalist species usually have to deal with a larger variety of cues during habitat selection than do specialists, and thus, learning has been proposed as a highly profitable strategy to find the most suitable habitat. We analysed the effect of previous experience on the use of visual information by the wasp Diachasmimorpha longicaudata, a generalist fruit fly larval parasitoid, in the context of host habitat selection. These parasitoids search for hosts concealed in plant structures, so visual cues from the hosts' environment could play a key role in host finding. We also studied how different visual cues used by this species interact and affect the habitat choices of female wasps. We studied three forms of visual cues: colour, shape and size. All experiments were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions, using artificial models mimicking fruit. Naive females showed no preference pattern for colour or shape, but they showed a clear preference for larger models. These results were unaffected when females were previously exposed to host larvae (no sensitization effect). Associative learning was found for colour: tested females developed a clear pattern of preferences after they were exposed to larvae associated with a particular colour. We found that colour and size have a similar effect on the female's choice, and that this effect is neither additive nor multiplicative. Our findings emphasize the importance of both visual cues during host habitat searching by D. longicaudata and the influence of learning on the preference patterns of a generalist parasitoid.

AB During fights animals are expected to make a series of strategic decisions that involve interactions between information about the contest and the individual's nervous system that produce a change in behaviour. Biogenic monoamines such as serotonin ('5-HT') and dopamine are thought to prime decision-making centres for appropriate responses during aggressive interactions in crustaceans, and circulating levels vary both between individuals and during agonistic encounters. Aminergenic systems operate in diverse animal taxa and in this study we assayed circulating levels of S-HT and dopamine following shell fights in the common European hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus. The two roles in these fights, attacker and defender, perform different activities but, in both, S-HT increased and dopamine declined in response to engaging in a fight. In defenders but not attackers, giving up was correlated with low 5-HT and dopamine. In attackers, motivation to initiate a fight was positively correlated with dopamine levels. Circulating monoamines are therefore involved in decision making during these aggressive encounters. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Shedding light on the origin of specific neuronal mechanisms for processing acoustic stimuli is important for understanding the evolution of primate communication. One of those specializations, lateralized processing of speech in humans, is a well-established finding. Evidence is accumulating that diverse animal taxa also show hemispheric asymmetries in the perception of conspecific sounds. Rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, for instance, show a right head-turning bias in response to playback of natural conspecific vocalizations, and a left head-turning bias in response to a heterospecific stimulus and several manipulated conspecific calls. This finding was related to a hemispheric specialization for processing conspeciftc versus heterospecific vocalizations. We conducted orienting experiments with Barbary macaques, M. sylvanus, living in the enclosure 'La Fork des Singes' in Rocamadour, France. In contrast to rhesus macaques, our subjects showed no orientation preferences in response to conspecific or heterospecific vocalizations. These results add to the puzzling mosaic picture of orienting asymmetries in different mammalian species and, in conjunction with other studies, highlight the importance of substantiating the assumption of a strong coupling of orienting bias and hemispheric asymmetry.

AB Experiments indicating learning in the context of courtship in fruit flies challenge the prevailing views that male insects are either indiscriminate or rely on innate rules for courtship. We investigated the conditions favouring learning during courtship in insects by using a model that compared a learning strategy to two alternatives, indiscriminate courtship and innate selectivity. Our analyses indicated that, under the two conditions of high encounter rates with females and long courtship durations, indiscriminate courtship resulted in much lower lifetime mating success than either selectivity or learning. Learning had moderate advantages over selectivity when encounter rates with females were high, when a large proportion of females were sexually receptive, and when acceptance rates by sexually receptive females were high. We predict that species in which such conditions commonly occur are most likely to show learning in the context of male courtship. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The young of precocial species such as the domestic chicken can, shortly after hatching, imprint on a visually conspicuous object. The chicks' filial behaviour is influenced by a predisposition, directing its attention towards conspecifics, and a learning process, allowing it to distinguish between individuals. The concentrations of maternally derived steroid hormones found in birds' eggs depend on environmental factors and may be how the hen influences her progeny's behavioural development. We tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to corticosterone affects filial behaviour in the chick. Eggs in the treatment group were injected with corticosterone before incubation; eggs in the control treatment were vehicle-injected. In experiment 1, coloured chicks were used as imprinting stimuli and subjects were tested in a simultaneous discrimination test. Control chicks showed a significant preference for the imprinting stimulus, but treatment chicks did not. There was no difference between groups in preference scores, which measured memory of the imprinting stimulus. However, colour affected preference score differently between groups. Treatment chicks spent more time with stimulus chicks, regardless of colour, than did control chicks, indicating that corticosterone increased the strength of the predisposition. In experiment 2, chicks were imprinted on objects and tested in a sequential discrimination test. The results indicated a tendency for discrimination in the control group but no discrimination in the treatment group. No difference in preference score between control and treatment chicks was found. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In social animals, dominance rank often influences individuals' behaviour, but in most cases it is unknown how dominance modulates the effects of other phenotypic traits. We investigated the mutual effects of social dominance and the level of energy reserves on the use of social-foraging strategies in captive flocks of house sparrows, Passer domesticus. We used experimental wind exposure to manipulate overnight energy expenditure of dominant and subordinate individuals. In response to the experimental treatment dominants used scrounging (exploiting others' food finding) significantly more, whereas for subordinates there was only a moderate and nonsignificant increase in scrounging. Individual variability in the frequency of scrounging was higher in subordinates than in dominants and this difference between the dominance groups was unaffected by the treatment. These results suggest that individuals of different dominance status adopt different strategies: to cope with an energetically challenging situation, dominants behave rather uniformly by increasing further their preference for scrounging, whereas subordinates do not alter their tactic, but may rely on using scrounging opportunistically.

AB Little is known about how vocal mimicry affects the behaviour of members of other species. Such effects might, however, be especially likely in mixed-species flocks in which birds of some species directly benefit from the behaviour of members of other species. In mixed-species flocks in Sri Lanka, the greater racket-tailed drongo, Dicrurus paradiseus, mimics the songs and contact calls of other flock participants. We hypothesized that this mimicry attracts other species, as drongos are well known to increase their foraging efficiency in association with other species. Consistent with the predictions of this hypothesis, we recorded the most mimicked vocalizations during the rare occasions in which drongos were outside of flocks. In addition, we performed a playback experiment, which showed that taped drongo vocalizations that included song mimicry were more than twice as attractive to birds of other species as were taped vocalizations that lacked mimicry. We suggest that mimicry is a way in which drongos manage the behaviour of flockmates in what appears to be overall a mutualistic relationship.

AB Understanding the role of multiple colour signals during sexual signalling is a central theme in animal communication. We quantified the role of multiple colour signals (including ultraviolet, UV), measures of body size and testosterone levels in settling disputes between male rivals in an elaborately ornamented, African lizard, played out in a large 'tournament' in the wild. The hue and brightness (total reflectance) of the UV throat in Augrabies flat lizards, Platysaurus broadleyi, as well as body size, were consistent and strong predictors of 'fighting ability'. Males with high fighting ability were larger and displayed a UV throat with low total reflectance. In contrast, males with low fighting ability were smaller and had violet throats with broader spectral reflectance curves (higher total reflectance). As fighting ability is associated with alternative reproductive tactics in this system (territorial versus floater), we also examined the role of colour signals in predicting male reproductive tactic. Territorial males had UV throats with higher chroma but had poorer body condition than floater males, probably because of the energetic costs of maintaining a territory. Although testosterone was not a significant predictor of fighting ability or reproductive tactic, it was correlated with the hue of the UV throat, suggesting that testosterone may impose some constraint on signal expression. Lastly, we show that within the context of the natural signalling environment, UV-reflective throats constitute a conspicuous, effective signal that male Augrabies flat lizards use to advertise their status honestly to rivals.

AB Numerous animal species produce calls to repel competitors and attract mates. Because body size often determines fighting ability and reproductive success, it is of critical importance to assess the reliability of acoustic variables that may serve as indicators of body size. In mammals, the fundamental frequency (F0) is determined by the subglottal air pressure and the length and tension of the vocal folds, while the location and spacing of the formants ('formant dispersion') are related to vocal tract length. Because F0 can be modulated, it has been suggested that formant dispersion but not F0 serves as a reliable predictor of body size. To test this assumption, we examined grunts recorded from hamadryas baboons. We used linear predictive coding to extract the formants, and an autocorrelation method to measure the fundamental frequency. We found that, across age classes and among adult females, the fundamental frequency was more closely related than formant dispersion to most physical measurements. Depending on the call type, and possibly the sex of the caller, the fundamental frequency can thus serve as a reliable indicator of physical characteristics of the caller.

ID PREFERENCE FUNCTIONS; SEXUAL SELECTION; TUNGARA FROG; FEMALE;
   INTRANSITIVITY; EVOLUTION; HONEYBEES; MODELS; GAME
AB We identify several fundamental properties of how females choose mates and propose statistical methods to test hypotheses about them. Virtually, all studies of mate choice have implicitly assumed that choice involves what we call strict preference. By that we mean that all the properties of a stimulus can be reduced to a single preference value that is independent of other stimuli, and that the stronger a female's preference for a male, the more likely she is to choose him. An important consequence of strict preference is that it guarantees that females cannot show intransitive choice (where male X-1 is preferred over male X-2, and X-2 over X-3, but X-3 is preferred over X-1). We find general conditions for the strict preference paradigm to apply in the simple situation where females choose between two potential mates. We illustrate how these conditions can be tested statistically using data on mate choice in tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus. The results were not consistent with any of the standard models for strict preference. On the other hand, we also failed to find statistical support for intransitive choice. We suggest that understanding mate choice will require deeper analysis of the most basic properties of the choice rules.

AB We studied the effects of natal experience on preference for a postdispersal habitat (natal habitat preference induction, NHPI) in groups of newly eclosed female Drosophila melanogaster, using multilevel statistical models to take into account dependencies of responses from individuals making choices within the same hour. Groups consisting of flies with one of five genotypes (crosses of highly inbred female isolines) were allowed free access to a high-quality natal habitat after emergence from their pupae. The flies were then allowed to select one of two new habitats in a large 'seminatural' environment over the next 3 days. The flies showed strong positive effects of training habitat on their choice of a new habitat, after controlling for potential dependence in choices within hours and trials. The genotypes also varied with respect to the effects of conspecifics and humidity on individual choice. A second analysis using data aggregated at the trial level and a traditional statistical approach (a generalized linear model, GLM) also detected effects of training on habitat choice. However, the GLM produced other results that may have been artefacts resulting from the omission of within-trial factors with important effects on choice in this trial-level analysis. This study shows the advantages of using multilevel models rather than aggregating data to control for interactions among subjects when animals select items in groups.

   DIRECTNESS; DECISIONS; RESPONSES; SPEED; COVER; COST
AB When approached by a potential predator, individuals must decide when to flee. Individuals could assess risk by monitoring their distance from an approaching threat or by monitoring the expected time that the predator would take to reach them. Theory predicts, and empirical studies support the hypothesis, that some species may maintain a temporal margin of safety and therefore monitor the expected time a predator would take to reach them. We systematically walked towards galahs, Cacatua roseicapilla, an Australian parrot, and varied our approach speed. If galahs maintain a temporal margin of safety, we expected them to flush at a greater distance in response to the fast approach. We found, however, no support for the temporal margin of safety hypothesis. Rather, we found evidence that galahs are sensitive to distance in a novel way: after being alerted, they flushed when humans approached to within 44% of the alert distance. Our result differs from traditional models of spatial margins of safety because it suggests that animals will take flight after being approached to within about half the alert distance. By doing so, individuals maintain a dynamic spatial margin of safety and may reduce costs associated with ongoing monitoring of predation risk.

AB Female choice for conspicuous secondary sexual traits, which often decrease male survival, is greatly debated in the sexual selection literature. The parasite-mediated sexual selection hypotheses suggest that parasite-resistant males should show greater expression of secondary sexual traits. Males in better condition should also have more extravagant ornamentation. According to these hypotheses, females that favour more conspicuous secondary sexual traits are choosing less parasitized males and/or those in better condition and should have offspring with better chances of surviving. We assessed interactions between the expression of secondary sexual traits, parasite load and body condition in the blue-black grassquit, Volatinia jacarina. We trapped and banded males and sampled intestinal parasites (coccidian oocysts). We considered plumage (percentage of blue-black coverage and coloration of feathers on rump and breast), display characteristics (frequency of events and height/frequency of leaps) and body condition (body mass and size, haematocrit and total plasma protein levels). There was a negative correlation between the number of oocysts and two secondary sexual traits, blue-black coverage and leap frequency. A negative correlation was also found between oocysts and two measures of body condition, body mass and size index. We found no correlation between body condition and secondary sexual traits. Results support parasite-mediated but not condition-dependent sexual selection. There were no correlations between body condition and secondary sexual traits, so parasites may affect secondary sexual traits directly. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The recent finding that in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, some males produce certain high-pitch song syllables during inspiration, a trait requiring unusual motor coordination, raises questions as to a possible role for these unusual sounds in mate attraction. If inspiratory syllables are indicative of a generally higher level of motor control, potentially relating to male quality, this might be reflected in other song characteristics. In a quantitative song analysis we found that the presence of inspiratory syllables in a male's individual-specific song motif covaried with both motif length and syllable rate. Furthermore, the unusually high frequencies at peak amplitude reached by such syllables exceed those of any other zebra finch syllable type. Hence, songs containing inspiratory phonation clearly differ both in performance aspects (syllable rate and motif length) and in structure from those that are wholly expiratory. These findings are in line with the idea that inspiratory syllables are indicative of enhanced motor control and performance. To test whether these differences bear on female receivers' preferences, we offered female zebra finches the choice between unmanipulated song motifs containing and lacking inspiratory phonation, in operant two-choice preference tests. Song motifs containing inspiratory phonation were not systematically preferred, both when songs were randomly paired and when motif length was controlled for, implying that this unusual trait does not impact significantly upon song attractiveness in an intersexual context.

AB Habitat quality, and the levels of habitat variables that are associated with good habitat, can vary between years. Therefore, animals that are able to adjust their habitat selectivity should enjoy higher fitness. I examined the use of experience in habitat selection during natal dispersal in Hemilepistus reaumuri, a monogamous, semelparous desert isopod. Young from the previous year emerge in the spring and walk from a few to over one thousand metres before establishing burrows or settling in already established burrows. Isopods were held in outdoor pens for 7-day priming treatments, then moved to new pens and tested for settling 4 days later. Perceived habitat quality was defined as the fraction of isopods settling in each pen during its use in the 7-day priming treatments. Settling was tested as a function of the change in perceived quality isopods experienced. Settling was significantly positively correlated with change in perceived quality, suggesting that experience is used to prime habitat selection during dispersal, and that the effects of experience last at least a few days in desert isopods. Time of year also had a significant positive effect on settling. The effect of change in perceived quality was stronger than the effect of perceived quality in the final pen. If changes in habitat are used to calibrate settling decisions, longer dispersal distances may be needed to allow for habitats to be compared. Use of experience to regulate settling may also affect the population dispersal response to habitat change. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   BEETLES; DYNAMICS; FIELD; RISK
AB Antipredator behaviour is not expected to evolve in response to generalist predators unless the prey forms a substantial proportion of the total diet of the predator and this predation is a major mortality factor. Since the generalist predator Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera: Carabidae) can affect the temporal and spatial dynamics of slugs, we investigated whether the slug Deroceras reticulatum responds to chemical cues from these beetles. We recorded the movements of slugs in arenas incorporating both a zone containing paper upon which the predatory beetles had been maintained and a control zone. Significantly more slugs accumulated on the control half of arenas after 24 h, with small slugs being quickest to respond. Slugs avoided paper exposed to both male and female beetles. They did not respond to paper that had been exposed to beetles and then stored for 5 days before the test. Slugs moved faster, turned less, spent proportionately more time moving and spent less time overall on paper exposed to male beetles than on control paper. This is consistent with a kinesis that would enable the slugs to escape rapidly from areas where predators were present. We conclude that slugs have evolved behavioural responses to chemical cues from either this generalist carabid predator in particular, or carabid beetles generally, many species of which include molluscs in their diets.

AB Ant queens generally monopolize reproduction, even though workers are able to produce males in orphaned colonies. The mechanisms maintaining worker sterility in the presence of a queen remain inadequately understood. In species with small societies, queens may use agonistic interactions, whereas pheromones are more efficient in large colonies. Whether such pheromones represent coercive tools or honest signals has not been established. We investigated behavioural interactions between queen and workers in the bulldog ant Myrmecia gulosa, a species with limited queen-worker dimorphism and small colonies. About 1.6% of a queen's time budget was spent visiting nest chambers, but there was no aggression and the workers sought contact with their queen, suggesting that pheromones are involved. Cuticular hydrocarbons deposited on the nest substrate by the queen were attractive to workers, but were not necessary for regulating their sterility. Confined queens were able to prevent worker oviposition. Myrmecia gulosa is monogynous and probably monandrous, and workers could maximize their fitness by producing sons and rearing nephews. None the less, they refrained from reproduction in the presence of a fertile queen, even though there was no queen policing. Worker sterility seems to be selected to maximize colony productivity. Our results provide evidence against the notion that queen pheromones inhibit worker oviposition. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR; CHEMICAL CUES; SURVIVAL; ENCOUNTERS; ARANEAE
AB The New Zealand endemic crab Heterozius rotundifrons displays an effective antipredator behaviour of fully extending all limbs for a number of seconds or even several minutes if presented with single sensory inputs (alarm odour of crushed conspecifics or an overhead shadow presentation) but fully extends all limbs for a shorter period when chemical and visual cues are presented simultaneously (Hazlett & McLay 2000, Animal Behaviour, 59, 965-974). Because the diversity of the sensory channels experienced and the total magnitude of cues indicating elevated risk were confounded in our earlier study, we separated the diversity and magnitude of cues to study the conditions that result in a switch in antipredator strategies. Crabs showed similar extended durations of the limb-extended state for all magnitudes of single modality treatments that were above threshold. Similarly, for all above-threshold combinations of modalities, the crabs showed similarly reduced durations of the limb-extended state compared with controls. It appears that the switch in strategies is induced just by the diversity of categories of risk cues, not their magnitude. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We present a computer model of avian navigation (homing) based on Kramer's 'Map and Compass' model. The key assumptions are: (1) the navigation environment contains two intersecting gradients, (2) the birds possess senses to measure these gradients, a compass sense, and an internal representation of the gradients, the navigational 'map'. By interpreting the difference in gradient values between home and at the release site with the help of its 'map', the simulated bird determines the homeward course which is then converted with the help of the compass into a heading. After 5 km, the course is recomputed. To assess the simulated birds' performance, we used (1) the mean vector of the initial headings of 50 runs as a measure of initial orientation, and (2) the mean homing efficiency, expressed as the ratio of the direct distance to the length of the route taken. The simulation shows that models of bicoordinate navigation allow successful homing from unknown sites with realistic values for the accuracy of the birds' senses. Irregularities in the navigational factors may lead to initial deviations from the home course and to lower homing efficiencies. Decreasing the accuracy of the compass readings impairs initial orientation and lowers homing efficiency, but the performance remains at a fairly high level for a long time. Decreasing the accuracy of reading gradients leads to a rapid increase in the number of birds getting 'lost', while those that return do so with moderate efficiency. These findings are discussed in view of the average performance of pigeons reflected by release experiments. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We investigated the effects of male nest guarding on egg survival in the flagfish, a species in which paternal care is thought to be relatively recently evolved. Thus, we characterized the fitness consequences of a major component of paternal care when secondary adaptations to care are likely to be minimal. The effects of guarding under three predation regimes were examined by exposing eggs to treatments in which no predators, conspecific females, and conspecific females and the egg predator Gambusia affinis were present. These were crossed with the presence and absence of parental males. We expected that guarding would result in an increase in egg survival in the presence of egg predators, but considered that in their absence the benefit might be decreased or absent, as a result of filial cannibalism. We also examined effects on egg survivorship stemming from filial cannibalism and egg-directed components of care (i.e. cleaning and fanning); the effects of these behaviours were examined through treatments in which males had full access to eggs (i.e. complete care), males were separated from their eggs by a screen (i.e. egg fanning and no cannibalism), and males were absent (i.e. no care and no cannibalism). In accordance with our expectations, guarding increased egg survivorship in the presence of females and Gambusia. However, egg survivorship when males were alone with eggs was low. Indeed, significantly more eggs were eaten than became diseased, suggesting that males cannibalize healthy eggs. Neither fanning nor cleaning resulted in an increase in egg survivorship. Thus, in flagfish, there may be costs of care when predators are absent. We discuss our findings in relation to sexual selection and the early evolution of parental care.

ID PATTERNS
AB Direct contact between individuals is important for the organization of social insects. The question has been raised whether in ant colonies contact may also provide a mechanism to allow ants to estimate the density of the population in a nest and regulate their behaviour accordingly, as reflected by a subquadratic dependence of the number of interactions as a function of the density. We developed a kinetic model of encounters between individuals, and conducted an experiment with different densities of the species Lasius niger. These suggested that the subquadratic law is not due to active regulation by ants but arises, rather, as a consequence of the kinetics of the encounter process and the presence of small, temporary clusters of individuals.

AB Competition for mating territories in libellulid dragonflies involves aerial contests that require high levels of exertion and locomotor performance. Here we test the hypothesis that success of male Libellula pulchella dragonflies in territoriality and mating is affected by muscle contractile performance, and we examine how gregarine gut parasites affect muscle performance, energy reserves and territorial behaviour of their hosts. At a pond where gregarine parasites are rare, long-term territorial and mating success of males showed a significant positive association with muscle power output. At a nearby pond that had a much higher incidence and intensity of gregarine parasitism, there was no relationship between muscle performance and short-term territorial success. Instead, males assorted themselves into aggressive territory holders and submissive satellites, with the large majority of territory holders having no parasites and nearly all of the satellites parasitized. Unparasitized males showed a tight positive relationship between muscle power and fat content, which suggests that they use a known phenotypic adjustment in muscle contractile performance to allow the energy consumption rate of the flight muscles to match the rate at which energy can be mobilized from storage pools. Parasitized dragonflies showed a small decrease in average fat content and a marked change in the relationship between fat content and muscle power output. The apparent loss of the ability to match muscle contractility to the size of the energy storage pool in parasitized dragonflies suggests that gregarines may have systemic effects on signalling pathways and energy homeostasis. By indirectly choosing males that had successfully competed for territories, females consistently mated with physiologically or immunologically superior males despite large between-pond differences in male behaviour and the incidence and intensity of parasitic infection.

AB Duetting, found in many animal taxa, is still a poorly understood form of signalling. behaviour despite numerous hypotheses to explain its function. One contentious issue is whether duetting is a cooperative endeavour or signals conflict between the sexes. We studied the function of duetting in the tropical boubou, using interactive playback experiments. We staged encounters by presenting paired birds with four variants of each of four duet types (neighbour and stranger solos and neighbour and stranger duets). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that both joint territorial defence and mutual mate guarding are important functions of duetting, and that both cooperation and conflict between males and females have shaped duetting behaviour. Of a repertoire of 12 duet types, eight were used for joint territorial defence. Two of these eight duet types were probably also used for mutual mate guarding, suggesting that individual duets can have multiple functions. We found an unusual response for duetting birds in that females often synchronized notes with male solo playback to form precise duets. In turn, males attempted to jam the song of rivals when females joined the song of male solo playback, providing further evidence for the importance of acoustic mate guarding. Song jamming by males has not previously been described for duetting species. Finally, we suggest that the repertoire of duet types is used to fine-tune territorial encounters in a network environment of multiple interactants.

ID EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS; SONG; VOCALIZATIONS; DISPLAYS
AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of vocalizations produced during the breeding season by the male harbour seal, an aquatically breeding pinniped. During the spring of 1999, playback experiments were conducted at eight locations in Elkhorn Slough, California, U.S.A. Through an underwater speaker, we presented male harbour seals with three acoustic stimuli: a long-duration, low-frequency roar (LL), a short-duration, high-frequency roar (SH) and amplified water noise (control). Male responses to the playback boat were characterized by increased approach rates and aggressive flipper slapping during 62.5% of SH sessions (N = 8), 25% of LL sessions (N = 8) and 0% of control sessions (N = 8). No more than one identifiable seal responded during each playback location. We observed no responses by female harbour seals to playbacks. We conclude from these experiments that territorial male harbour seals use roars given by intruders to locate and challenge intruders. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB For mate-searching species, the learned mate recognition (LMR) hypothesis assumes that sexual harassment favours signal variation among females, which exploits the receiver ability of males. The model predicts that coevolving males have responded to the female sexual foil by learning to recognize female variants as potential mates. I translate the LMR hypothesis into the language of signal detection theory to explain its novelty as a dynamic, coevolutionary, negative frequency-dependent selection model. Due to gene-environment interactions, males cueing to the morph detected most often should generate positive but often asymmetrical, detection-dependent harassment towards females. Females are expected to sort to an ideal free distribution where harassment costs are equal. At equilibrium, morph fitness, but not necessarily morph frequency, is predicted to be equal. The LMR hypothesis is consistent with recent experimental data and the distribution of colour polymorphisms in the Odonata, predicts general conditions favouring variation in sexual signals, and provides a novel mechanism for speciation via sexual signalling.

AB During vocal contests, animals alter both the timing and the patterning of responses to their opponents. Time-specific responses (such as overlapping an opponent's song) and pattern-specific responses (such as matching the type of an opponent's song) may reveal information about interacting animals. Here we explore the consequences of overlapping and frequency matching during song contests of male black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus. Using interactive playback, we engaged birds of high and low dominance status in vocal interactions with a simulated territorial intruder. The playback intruder either overlapped or avoided overlapping the subjects' songs and either matched or avoided matching the frequency of the subjects' songs. Individuals who were overlapped by the playback intruder showed higher variability in their song length and song timing than individuals who were not overlapped. Individuals who were frequency-matched by the playback intruder responded with more agitated responses (more flights and passes over the speaker and closer distances of closest approach) and spent more time farther away from the loudspeaker. We argue that the timing of song delivery and the choice of song type are distinct functional components of vocal interactions, where overlapping and matching songs are threatening signals that have separate consequences for opponent behaviour and song performance. High-ranking males responded at greater distances from the loudspeaker in all. treatments and responded with lower agitation levels than low-ranking males. We demonstrate that males of different quality show different behavioural responses to territorial intruders, where males of high status appear reluctant to engage an intruder as intensely as males of low status.

AB The optimal investment strategies of parents in biparental systems are well studied. This contrasts with a poor theoretical and empirical understanding of variation in individual investment in breeding systems with multiple carers. We used the cooperative breeding system of long-tailed tits, to investigate how parents and helpers adjust their rate of nestling provisioning in relation to measures of nestling demand and the number of helpers. Our aim was to examine whether parents and helpers follow the same provisioning rules. Overall provisioning rates were higher for parents than for helpers. However, both parents and helpers increased their provisioning rates as nestlings aged and provisioned at higher rates early in the day. Parents brought more food to larger broods when not helped, but at nests with helpers, neither parents nor helpers had significantly higher provisioning rates at larger broods. However the total provisioning rate was higher at larger broods at both nests with and without helpers. Parents reduced their work rate in response to the arrival of a helper, but neither parents nor first helpers reduced their work rates further with arrival of additional helpers. Variation in provisioning rates between parents and helpers may be the result of different cost-benefit relations, and a theoretical framework is needed within which to explore the consequences of such differences.

AB Courtship pheromones play an important role in salamander reproductive behaviour. In salamanders of the family Plethodontidae, males deliver specialized pheromones to females during courtship interactions. These courtship pheromones increase female receptivity and may be involved in mate discrimination. In order to test hypotheses related to mate discrimination, we staged courtship encounters between male-female Plethodon shermani pairs in which the female received pheromones obtained from either conspecific (P. shermani) or heterospecific (P. yonahlossee or P. montanus) males. Both conspecific and heterospecific pheromones increased female receptivity. Moreover, pheromones from both heterospecific species were as effective as the conspecific pheromone in increasing female receptivity in P. shermani females. Our results suggest that the courtship pheromone signal and function may be conserved across related species, with mate discrimination occurring before pheromone delivery.

AB In a series of four experiments, we examined the relationship between male dominance and female preference in Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica. Female quail that had watched an aggressive interaction between a pair of males preferred the loser of an encounter to its winner. This superficially perverse female preference for losers may be explained by the strong correlation between the success of a male in aggressive interactions with other males and the frequency with which he engages in courtship behaviours that appear potentially injurious to females. By choosing to affiliate with less dominant male quail, female quail may lose direct and indirect benefits that would accrue from pairing with dominant males. However, they also avoid the cost of interacting with potentially harmful, more aggressive males. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID HABITAT SELECTION; FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSES; SVALBARD; MIGRATION; TRANSPORT;
   MOVEMENTS
AB For animals in dynamic habitats, the contribution of passive (i.e. by wind or current) and active (movements by the animals themselves) displacement determines whether their space use reflects physical or adaptive behavioural processes. Polar bears in the Barents Sea undertake extensive annual migrations in a habitat that is highly dynamic because of continuous sea ice drift. Using combined information from satellite telemetry, satellite images and atmospheric pressure recordings, we estimated the contribution of sea ice drift and movements in the monthly net displacement of female polar bears. We found that movements, and thus behavioural processes, were dominant. Net displacement was directed northwards during summer ice retreat and southwards during winter ice advance. Conversely, movements were directed northwards counteracting a continuous southward drift. Acting as a treadmill, ice drift probably increased the energetic cost of migrations relative to that expected from observed net displacement distances; this suggests that pelagic and adjacent near-shore bears, on stable land-fast ice, have different energy costs. Little concordance between ice drift rates and net displacement and movement rates suggest that polar bears do not adjust their displacement relative to attractive areas with fixed locations, but rather adjust their movements to local habitat suitability. Furthermore, selective use of less dynamic drift ice when with cubs-of-the-year, and use of terrestrial denning areas, appear to be behavioural adaptations to the dynamics of the Barents Sea drift ice. Hence, understanding the behaviour and ecology of animals inhabiting dynamic habitats necessitates incorporation of both dynamic and static habitat variables.

TI Scrounging facilitates social learning in common marmosets,
   <i>Callithrix jacchus</i>
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID IMITATION; FLOCKS
AB We investigated the effect of close social interaction on the ability to learn a new behaviour via observation. The task chosen involved sliding a small door horizontally to gain access to a food reward. We divided 59 common marmosets into five groups that received different pretest experience: observation of a trained demonstrator through wire mesh (O); joint interaction with a trained demonstrator allowing the possibility of scrounging (S); individual interaction with the apparatus (I); joint interaction with another naive individual (J); and no prior experience (control, C). Significantly more individuals from the scrounging group learned the new behaviour, compared with the group (0) that had purely observational experience. When animals from group O were later allowed to interact jointly with a trained demonstrator, the success rate of this group significantly increased. Social interaction with the demonstrator may have facilitated learning because it allowed subjects to understand the relation between the apparatus and the food or because social support facilitated interaction with the apparatus. However, results from the other conditions suggest that these factors alone do not account for the size of the effect. Thus, contrary to previous investigations of this phenomenon, scrounging facilitated social learning. This result probably depended on a complex interaction of a number of factors, including individual learning opportunities, social support and closer attention to the demonstrator.

AB Contests between rivals placing similar value on the resource at stake are commonly won by the rival having greater 'resource holding potential' (RHP). Mutual assessment of RHP difference between rivals is usually expected as an economical means of resolution; weaker rivals can retreat when they detect their relative inferiority, thereby avoiding costly, futile persistence. Models of contest resolution that entail retreat decisions based on estimates of RHP difference predict that contest duration diminishes as RHP difference between rivals increases because the asymmetry is more readily detected. This prediction appears to have been fulfilled in contests of diverse taxa, generating widespread support for assessment of RHP differences in contests. But few studies have considered alternatives in which each rival simply persists in accord with its own RHP ('own RHP-dependent persistence'). In contests decided by own RHP-dependent persistence, in which costs accrue only through each rival's own actions, weaker rivals retreat first because they are inherently less persistent, and contest duration depends primarily on the weaker (losing) rival's RHP rather than RHP difference between the rivals. We show here that the analyses most commonly used to detect effects of RHP difference cannot discriminate between these alternatives. Because RHP difference between rivals tends to be correlated with RHP of the weaker rival in a pair, a negative relation between RHP difference and contest duration may be generated even when decisions of retreat are not based on estimated RHP difference. Many studies purporting to show a negative relation between RHP difference and contest duration may actually reflect an incidental association between weaker rival RHP and RHP difference. We suggest statistical and experimental approaches that may help to discriminate between effects of weaker rival RHP and true effects of RHP difference. We also discuss whether 'true' negative effects of RHP difference on contest duration always reflect retreat decisions based on estimated RHP differences.

AB We tested the ability of birds to detect and discriminate natural vocal signals in the presence of masking noise using operant conditioning. Masked thresholds were measured for budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus, and zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, on natural contact calls of budgerigars, zebra finches and canaries, Serinus canaria. Thresholds increased with increasing call bandwidth, the presence of amplitude modulation and high rates of frequency modulation in calls. As expected, detection thresholds increased monotonically with background noise level. Call detection thresholds varied with the spectral shape of noise. Vocal signals were masked predominantly by noise energy in the spectral region of the signals and not by energy at spectral regions remote from the signals. In all cases thresholds for discrimination between calls of the same species were higher than thresholds for detection of those calls. Our data provide the first opportunity to estimate distances over which specific communication signals may be effective (i.e. their 'active space') using masked thresholds for the signals themselves. Our results suggest that measures of peak sound pressure level, combined with the spectrum level of noise within the frequency channel having the greatest signal power relative to background noise, give the most similar results for estimating a signal's maximum communication distance across a variety of sounds. We provide a simple model for estimating likely detection and discrimination distances for the signals tested here.

AB Knowledge of how animals manage their conflicts is critical for understanding the dynamics of social systems. During the last two decades research on gregarious animals, especially primates, has focused on the mechanisms of conflict management, mainly on friendly postconflict reunions (also called 'reconciliation') in which former opponents exchange affiliative behaviour soon after an aggressive conflict. Our aim in this paper is to present a framework in which the costs and benefits of friendly postconflict reunions, both for each individual opponent and for their mutual relationship, are used to predict the patterning of postconflict resolution mechanisms in other gregarious animals. The framework predicts the occurrence of postconflict reunions in species that live in stable social units, have individualized relationships, and experience postconflict hostility, but especially in those in which intragroup aggression disrupts valuable relationships. The critical issue is whether aggressive conflicts occur between cooperative partners and whether the level of aggression is sufficient to jeopardize the benefits associated with such valuable relationships. We conclude by proposing four research priorities to evaluate the role of friendly reunions in negotiating relationships and the way they are themselves influenced by asymmetries in partner value and biological market effects.

AB Kinship theory implies that individual social Hymenoptera should be able to identify kin. We tested kin discrimination in the polygynous ponerine ant Gnamptogenys striatula. Mate choice experiments showed that individuals did not pair according to kinship. Experiments on matriline discrimination revealed that workers did not preferentially groom, transport (after nest disturbance) or cannibalize (after starvation) larvae on the basis of kin, when both related and unrelated larvae were present. These results show the absence of kin discrimination for the criteria and experimental conditions used. The lack of kin discrimination during mate choice in G. striatula can be explained by male dispersion and female philopatry, which reduces the likelihood of mating between siblings and of kin-based mate choice reflected in incest avoidance. The lack of matriline discrimination by workers may reflect permanent intracolony mutualism or the high cost of discrimination. Finally, it appears that the absence of kin discrimination in such contexts in G. striatula is not incompatible with kinship theory and may have been secondarily selected during social evolution.

AB Laboratory and field manipulations,tested whether male Anolis carolinensis lizards and discriminate preference for novel female,over resident females. In, 16 laboratory trials, we videotaped social interactions between paired males and females during baseline, session (male and resident female housed together 1-3 weeks), resident-female session (male and reintroduced. resident female), and novel-female session (male and novel, female With resident female removed). We examined 22 behavioural variables. Male behaviours did not differ significantly between baseline and resident-female sessions, nor did female behaviours differ significantly,between baseline, resident-female and novel-female sessions. However, between resident-female and novel-female sessions, males significantly increased display rate (320%), volleys of repetitive displaying (300%) and volley length (150%), and significantly decreased the distance (375%) and number (430%) of movements travelled away from the female. We concluded that males discriminate novel females from resident females independently of female behavioural or chemical cues. in each of 18 field trials, we first videotaped baseline social interactions, of the resident male and females in a naturally occurring, polygynous, breeding group. The next day, we released two novel females into the territory (so at least one female, remained) and videotaped subsequent social interactions. In comparison to baseline observations, males significantly increased the proportion of time spent in female-directed activities. (from 5% towards resident, females to 53% towards the novel female) and the proportion of displays directed. towards novel females (from 6%. towards resident females to 51% towards the novel female), and significantly decreased the proportion of time spent in territorial activities (from 75% to 19%) and the proportion of displays used in territorial activities (from 94% to 44%). Data from both experiments indicate that males appear to distinguish among individual females, and use this ability to increase reproductive success by identifying and preferentially pursuing novel females over previously inseminated resident females. From the perspective of cognitive ethology, we suggest a model by which males control mating decisions within their territories. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The costs of singing in birds are poorly understood. One potential type of cost is a metabolic cost of singing. Previous studies have measured short-term changes in oxygen consumption associated with bouts of vocalizations, with equivocal results. In this study, I used an alternative approach to measuring the metabolic cost of singing, by measuring overnight loss of body mass, in male common nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos, singing at night at different rates. Nightingales were shown not to forage at night. They reached a higher mass at dusk prior to singing more at night, and lost more mass overnight when dusk mass and overnight song rate were high. These results show that singing at night is associated with increased overnight consumption of body reserves, which represents a significant metabolic cost of singing at night. However, the correlation between dusk mass and overnight song rate makes it impossible to determine whether these costs arise from the energetic costs of the singing itself, or from the metabolic costs of the additional body reserves laid down at dusk on nights when song rate was high. There are also likely to be costs associated with accumulating and carrying these extra body reserves during daylight, as well as other potential costs of singing such as an increased risk of predation. These results are consistent with those models of signalling in biology that predict or assume that honest signals are costly. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Gouzoules et al. (1984, Animal Behaviour, 32, 182-193) presented evidence that semifree-ranging rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta, produce acoustically distinctive classes of scream vocalizations that carry different functional messages. To determine the perceptual validity of these vocal classes, we conducted psychophysical experiments on captive rhesus monkeys. We trained two monkeys to maintain contact with a metal response cylinder during presentation of nontarget stimuli, and to release the cylinder to report detection of target stimuli. For one subject, tonal screams served as nontarget stimuli and arched screams served as targets. These conditions were reversed for a second subject. Once natural exemplars were correctly discriminated, both subjects correctly generalized to synthetic targets. Variability in responses to nontarget stimuli, however, suggested that scream categories were not well defined following training. This result suggests that rhesus monkeys do not perceive categorical distinctions between arched and tonal screams, at least under the testing conditions implemented. Rather, our results provide evidence for a graded category. To explore which acoustic features are most important for classifying novel exemplars as tonal or arched screams, we ran several follow-up experiments with novel scream exemplars. Generalization trials suggested that variation in rate of frequency change, maximum frequency of the fundamental and harmonic structure may be important to the discrimination of screams.

   TROPHALLAXIS; FORAGERS; TIME
AB Forager honeybees returning to the hive after a successful foraging trip unload the collected liquid to recipient hivemates through mouth-to-mouth food exchange contacts (trophallaxis). The speed at which the liquid is transferred (unloading rate) from donor to recipient is related to the profitability offered by the recently visited food source. Two of the main characteristics that define food source profitability are the flow of solution delivered by the feeder and the time invested by the forager feeding at the source (feeding time). To investigate which of these two variables is related to unloading rate, we individually trained donor foragers to a regulated-flow feeder that presented changes in the delivered flow of solution within a single foraging bout, while feuding time remained constant. With the range of flows used, bees attained maximum crop loads in all experiments, During the subsequent trophallactic encounter with an unfed recipient hivemate, unloading rate was differentially affected by the changes in flow of solution presented during the previous foraging trip at the source, depending on whether there had been an increase or a decrease of flow rate within that visit. Foragers unloaded at lower rates when they experienced a decrease in flow rate, but did not increase the unloading rate when presented with an increase at the food source. Thus, forager honeybees seem to be able to detect variations in the delivered flow of solution, since they modulate unloading rate in relation to these changes, although decreases in food value seem to be perceptually weighted in relation to increases, independently of the time invested in the food-gathering process.

AB The speed at which air-breathing marine predators that forage by diving should swim is likely to depend on a variety of factors that differ substantially from those relevant in animals for which access to oxygen is unlimited. We used loggers attached to free-living penguins to examine the speed at which three species swam during periods searching for prey and compared this to their speeds during actual prey pursuit. All penguin species appeared to travel at similar speeds around 2 m/s during normal commuting between the surface and feeding depths, which accords closely with minimum costs of transport. However, Adelie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, slowed down to feed, Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus, speeded up and king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, travelled at a variety of speeds, although mean speed did not change from normal commuting. Since energy expenditure, and therefore oxygen usage, in swimming animals increases with the cube of the speed, we hypothesized that prey escape speed (a function of prey size) and prey density would prove critical in determining optimum pursuit speeds in predators. Simple models of this type help explain why it is that some penguin species apparently benefit by increasing speed to capture prey while others benefit by decreasing speed.

   SYSTEM; BIRDS; FISH
AB Visual scanning for predators is one of a bird's most basic means of avoiding predation while feeding, and the detection of an approaching predator may present a difficult visual task. If birds have a dominant hemisphere for processing visual information, then given the nearly complete optic nerve crossover in the avian brain, the eye contralateral to that dominant hemisphere should be favoured in antipredatory vigilance. In short, vigilant birds should have a favourite eye. We conducted an experiment that examined laterality in eye use during the antipredatory scanning of wintering emberizid sparrows: dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, and American tree sparrows, Spizella arborea. Free-living birds were allowed to feed parallel to a visual obstruction, thereby forcing them to choose which eye to orient away from the visual obstruction and towards possible approaching predators. Juncos oriented themselves such that their right eye was oriented outward more than would be expected by chance. Tree sparrows had a marginally nonsignificant tendency to favour the left eye. The mechanics of the scanning process itself in these birds favoured one eye over the other. Both species turned their heads towards the visual obstruction when their preferred eye was facing away from the obstruction more often than would be expected by chance (right eye in juncos, left eye in tree sparrows); such behaviour allowed for a preferred-eye view of the area directly opposite protective cover. These results suggest that laterality exists in avian vigilance, and that laterality may differ even in closely related species. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated the importance of spatial knowledge of food positions and of feeding experience on foraging choices in German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.). We trained cockroaches in an arena to feed on a particular food close to a landmark. To test whether the landmark helped guide cockroaches to the site, we removed the food and put the landmark in a different position. Cockroaches then went to the site indicated by the landmark. Given a choice between novel food in a new site and the known food in the known site, cockroaches preferred the novel food. But when the novel food was placed in the known site and the known food elsewhere, cockroaches were attracted to the latter. Thus, they differentiated novel food placed in a site that was previously occupied by the known food from novel food in a novel site. It seems that cockroaches learn the locations of specific resources in their home range and associate particular locations with particular resources.

ID MENSTRUAL SYNCHRONY; OVARIAN-CYCLE; PHEROMONES; ENTRAINMENT; BIOLOGY
AB I investigated oestrous and birth synchrony in 22 groups of four sibling females from puberty to the birth of their first litters. I used Monte Carlo bootstrap simulations to evaluate whether the degree of synchrony observed in these groups differed from chance. No process of synchronization was found, however. No relationship between the degree of synchrony at first oestrus (puberty) and last oestrus (prior to introducing a breeding male into each group) was found. No relationship between the degree of oestrous synchrony and birth synchrony was found. These results conflict with previous results reporting synchrony in Norway rats. I suggest that the difference between this study and the previous study may have been due to the level of analysis at which these studies were statistically analysed. In this study, I measured and analysed synchrony at the level of the group, whereas in the original study, synchrony was measured at the level of the group but analysed at the level of the individual. These results have important negative implications. First, they undermine communal care or group mating hypotheses for the evolution of ovarian synchrony. Second, they further undermine the coupled-oscillator model of synchrony in rats; and thereby its application to other species. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We examined the effect of prior winning and losing experiences on the initiating and responding strategies of contestants in contests between individuals of Rivulus marmoratus (Cyprinodontidae). Each contestant tvas given a penultimate and a recent fighting experience approximately 48 and 24 h prior to the dyadic contests, respectively, through randomly selected procedures. Winning and losing experience appeared to influence different types of fighting behaviours. Losing: experiences decreased the probability of an individual initiating a confrontation and thus increased its tendency to retreat immediately when challenged. Winning experiences did not affect the probability of initiation, but significantly increased the likelihood of an individual initiating with attacks that effectively deterred its opponents. A substantial proportion (59/153) of individuals retreated immediately when challenged and reduced the number of fights available for examining experience effects on responding strategies at later stages of a contest. None the less, winning experiences consistently increased the likelihood of an individual retaliating by attacking its opponent at various stages of a contest, and eventually increased its probability of escalating a confrontation into physical fights. However, the effects of losing experiences on these responding strategies were undetectable. Recent experiences significantly affected all fighting behaviours examined, but penultimate experiences significantly affected only the tendency to initiate a confrontation with attacks and the likelihood of escalation. These results indicated that prior experiences had the longest lasting effect on the potentially most costly fighting behaviour. Prior experiences influenced the outcome of nonescalated contests as well as the probability of escalation, but did not significantly affect the outcome of escalated contests. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that prior experiences modify the information that an individual has. about its fighting ability but do not alter its actual fighting ability and that actual fighting ability becomes the more important influence on outcomes of escalated contests.

AB The ability of animals to orient based on pheromonal cues in the environment can have significant consequences to their reproductive success and survival. For example, it is hypothesized that snakes use pheromone trails to locate potential mates during the breeding season and to locate winter hibernacula. Numerous studies have demonstrated that snakes are capable of detecting and following pheromone trails in the laboratory, but it has yet to be shown experimentally whether snakes use such behaviour in their natural environment In this study, we conducted trailing experiments to test the response of adult red-sided garter snakes to pheromone trails on the natural substrate under naturally occurring conditions during two periods, the spring breeding season and the autumn migration back to the hibernacula. Male snakes detected and followed female trails in the spring, while neither sex displayed trailing behaviour during the period of autumn migration. Our results suggest that adult garter snakes use pheromone trails for locating potential mates during the breeding season and most likely rely on other mechanisms (e.g. visual cues) for navigation to overwintering hibernacula.

AB I present the first behavioural study of natural populations of a Madagascan poison frog. Focal watches of marked individuals were conducted for 925 h, in five populations, across two seasons. Like the New World dendrobatids, these diurnal anurans eat ants and are aposematically coloured. Data are presented that provide additional instances of convergence with the dendrobatids, including (1) extended male-male fights over defended resources necessary for reproductive success of both sexes, (2) stereotyped, highly tactile courtships in which the female may reject initial oviposition sites and (3) complex maternal care. Females return to water-filled phytotelmata, or wells, and lay trophic eggs for their tadpoles, Mantella laevigata has the minimum possible clutch size in anurans (usually one) suggesting a high degree of parental investment. Males defend wells, which attract females that oviposit in the wells. Fertilized eggs ma tr hatch and metamorphose, or may be eaten by a tadpole already in that well, of which the territorial male is probably the father. Unfertilized eggs serve as food for tadpoles. Oviposition-site scouting behaviour of both sexes, and the dependency of tadpole presence on the position of eggs laid, provide evidence of context-dependent, and assessment, behaviour. Females leave courtships most often only after visiting potential oviposition sites, while males usually leave to engage other males in aggression, suggesting that territory maintenance may be the most important component of male reproductive success. Two other species of frogs often prevent M. laevigata from using defended oviposition sites, and larval crane flies predate the eggs of all frog species using water-filled wells.

ID DISCRIMINATION; MAMMALS; HORSES
AB To examine whether fallow deer, Dama dama, have colour vision, we trained four adult females on a two-choice discrimination task, where a positive chromatic stimulus (green) and a negative achromatic stimulus (grey) had similar brightness. The criterion for learning was set at 80% correct responses. To exclude the possibility that the hinds used small differences in brightness to distinguish between the green and the grey stimulus, we conducted a test that differed from the training situation. A light green positive stimulus combined with a dark grey negative stimulus was alternated with a dark green positive stimulus combined with a light grey negative stimulus on every second trial. The positive green stimuli had different reflectance spectra. After training, each of the four hinds showed over 80% correct responses in the test. These results suggest that fallow deer can use colour vision in a discrimination situation by generalizing over slightly different colours, at least in the range of the green spectrum.

AB The marking of flowers with ephemeral scent is an underappreciated but vital element in the foraging behaviour of social bees. Using observational and experimental data, we tested whether a solitary bee (female Anthophora plumipes) uses scent marking while foraging on flowers of Cerinthe major in Portugal. Females used scent marks with at least two components that differed in their volatility and, furthermore, recognized the marks of different individuals. A very short-term component (<3 min) was attractive, resulting in the observed high level of immediate revisits: this component appeared to be adjusted according to the foraging needs of the moment. A longer-term component (<30 min) was initially repellent and matched the rate of nectar renewal; it, or the response to it, also appeared to be adjusted to the perceived level of nectar reward. There may be even longer-term effects associated with the specific foraging areas of individual bees. Observed differences in the way in which individuals responded to scent marks indicate that they may play a role as part of a dominance or exclusion mechanism among females.

   CHOICE; COLORATION; SELECTION; HANDICAP
AB For signalling to be honest the handicap principle claims that signals must impose fitness costs so that only the best individuals can afford the most exaggerated signals. The cost of signalling in terms of reduced survival decreases, however, towards the end of an individual's lifetime, which can induce an increase in signalling effort as a terminal effort. I show for the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, that a decrease in survival prospects through impaired condition leads to an increase in red nuptial coloration that makes the signal less reliable as an indicator of male parental ability. Males in poor condition with a large signal sometimes cannibalized all the eggs tl-ley received, probably to start a new breeding cycle with a higher energy reserve. However, the inclusion of socially imposed costs of signalling through male-male competition during courtship increased the honesty of the signal, as some males in poor condition and of poor parental ability decreased their signal expression. Some cheaters still occurred, but the signalling system was honest on average. This implies that socially imposed costs are important in the maintenance of honest sexual signalling. Dishonesty may occur under favourable conditions when the cost of signalling is reduced. This emphasizes the importance of considering the environmental conditions experienced by individuals when investigating the evolution and maintenance of honest sexual signals.

AB Communication between territorial songbirds usually involves a transfer of encoded information over long distances. We would expect coding and decoding strategies to be adaptive given the constraints imposed by the habitat. We used playback to examine some song parameters important for information transfer in the wren, Troglodytes troglodytes. Six stimuli were tested with various modifications to song rhythmicity, song composition, element structure, syntax and overall song spectra. Song features encoding information essential for eliciting a territorial response seemed to be embedded in the fine structure of song elements, that is, their variations in frequency and amplitude over time. To function, this strategy must be flexible enough to accommodate the deleterious effects of habitat-induced degradation. All stimuli composed of original song elements elicited responses regardless of their other alterations. Rhythmicity seemed not to be essential for eliciting territorial behaviour. However, alterations in song rhythmicity, syntax and spectra affected territorial responses, suggesting that these nonessential song parameters do contribute to the options for discrimination.

AB My aim was to show how individual-oriented (or artificial life) models may provide an integrative background for the development of theories about dominance by including effects of spatial structure. Dominance interactions are thought to serve two different, contrasting functions: acquisition of high rank and reduction of aggression. The model I present consists of a homogeneous virtual world inhabited by artificial agents whose actions are restricted to grouping and dominance interactions in which the effects of winning and losing are self-reinforcing. The two functions are implemented as strategies to initiate dominance interactions and the intensity of aggression and dominance perception (direct or memory based) are varied experimentally. Behaviour is studied by recording the same behavioural units as in real animals. Ranks appear to differentiate more clearly at high than at low intensity of aggresion and also more in the case of direct than of memory-based rank perception. Strong differentiation of rank produces a cascade of unexpected effects that differ depending on which function is implemented: for instance,a decline in aggression, spatial centrality of dominants and a correlation between rank and aggression. Insight into the origination of these self-organized patterns leads to new hypotheses for the study of the social behaviour of real animals.

AB Previous investigations have demonstrated the importance of predator diet in chemically mediated antipredator behaviour. However, there are few data on responses to life-stage-specific predator diets, which could be important for animals like amphibians that undergo metamorphosis and must respond to different suites of predators at different life-history stages. In laboratory choice tests, we investigated the chemically mediated avoidance response of juvenile western toads, Bufo boreas, to four different chemical stimuli: (1) live conspecific juveniles; (2) live earthworms; (3) snakes fed juvenile conspecifics; and (4) snakes fed larval conspecifics (tadpoles). Juvenile toads avoided chemical cues from snakes that had eaten juvenile conspecifics, but did not respond to the other three stimuli, including chemical cues from snakes fed larval conspecifics. In addition, the response to cues from snakes fed juveniles differed significantly from that of snakes fed larvae. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the importance of diet in predator avoidance of juvenile anurans and the ability of juvenile toads to distinguish between chemical cues from predators that have consumed larval versus juvenile conspecifics.

AB Many models of animal signal evolution fail to incorporate an explicit strategy for receivers prior to the evolution of signals. When reasonable assumptions are made for such strategies, we have shown that there is a minimal, accuracy of signal coding that is required before receivers should attend to signals (Bradbury & Vehrencamp 1998, Principles of Animal Communication). Depending upon the relative payoffs of correct and incorrect decisions by receivers, this minimal accuracy can be quite high. Here we use this result to explain why so many signals appear to be traits that provided useful information to receivers before becoming ritualized into signals. Our model also supports one prediction of sensory drive models: that latent preferences may selectively favour some signal precursors over others. However, it imposes a serious constraint on sensory drive by requiring that there be sufficient benefits to a receiver to compensate for the costs of disrupting the optimal receiver strategy used before exploitation. Finally, we discuss the overlap between signal honesty and accuracy and show how senders that completely disagree with receivers about appropriate receiver decisions may still-benefit by providing moderately honest and accurate signals.

TI Egg-dumping lace bugs preferentially oviposit with kin

ID GARGAPHIA-SOLANI HEMIPTERA; TINGIDAE; PARASITISM; BIRDS; RECOGNITION;

AB Egg dumping, or abandoning eggs and young to the care of other conspecifics, results in an extreme form of alloparental care. It is unclear, however, if egg dumpers discriminate among kin and nonkin egg recipients. In the lace bug Gargaphia solani (Heteroptera: Tingidae), some females with eggs (guards) also accept and defend eggs of conspecifics. Other females (egg dumpers) abandon their offspring after oviposition, leaving a single guard as the caregiver. We asked if egg dumpers preferentially dump their eggs among unguarded eggs of kin or nonkin. When given a choice between dumping among eggs of full Siblings and eggs of nonsiblings, most eggs (67%) were dumped with full siblings' eggs. Furthermore, egg dumpers were just as likely to oviposit among eggs of kin with whom they had interacted on a shared host plant during juvenile development as they were to oviposit with, kin reared on different host plants. Thus, egg dumpers discriminate kin by using cues associated With eggs, and such cues are not likely to be acquired through interaction on a common host plant environment.

AB The field slug, Deroceras reticulatum, a common pest of agricultural and horticultural crops, is a generalist herbivore with distinct preferences for particular food items. However, these preferences are not fixed, but are influenced by the recent dietary history of the slugs. In particular, slugs tend to select novel food items ('neophilia'). We investigated the basis of such influences, using artificial diets in which protein and carbohydrate composition could be controlled and non-nutritional ('secondary') chemicals added as flavours. The slugs showed no general inclination for neophilia based on taste alone. There was a possible learned association between protein content and taste, but this was weakly expressed. However, the slugs selected food items, when given a choice, containing nutrients that were deficient in earlier diets, even though all the food items contained the same familiar secondary taste chemicals. Injections of missing nutrients into the haemocoel of slugs inhibited such changes in food preference, indicating that slugs' feeding preferences are influenced directly by their internal nutritional status. We suggest that neophilia in D. reticulatum is a physiological response to a nutritional imbalance arising from a suboptimal diet. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When there is a direct relationship between testosterone level and payoff in reproductive success through aggression, testosterone levels should be elevated. Elevated testosterone, however, has fitness costs, particularly a decreased tendency to display parental; care. Thus the pattern of testosterone secretion in males should vary with the social and mating system. Western scrub-jays, Aphelocoma californica woodhouseii, form monogamous pairs on territories during the breeding Season. Mexican lays, A. ultra-marina, live; in large, stable groups and up to five females within a group attempt nesting each spring. In both species, testosterone levels rose rapidly in March and peak levels did not differ. Elevated testosterone levels were only observed for about 3 weeks in the monogamous western scrub-lay, but were observed into May in Mexican lays, a reflection of prolonged opportunity for males to mate with multiple females and continual interaction with other competing males. In Mexican lays, nonbreeding yearlings had lower testosterone levels than all other age groups. Testosterone in males owning nests did not differ from that in other adult males, many of whom engage in extrapair fertilizations. Testosterone was elevated throughout the incubation phase, but was significantly lower when chicks were present in any nest in the group. Nearly all birds in the group fed all chicks. These observations support the hypothesis that testosterone is elevated when male-male competition is frequent and mating opportunities depend on the outcome of that competition, and testosterone is decreased when the necessity for parental or alloparental care would make its effects deleterious.

We conclude that: (1) mirror self-exploration provides evidence for mirror self-recognition; (2) inter- and intraspecies differences in terms of presence or absence of mirror self-recognition are not yet sufficiently clear, that is, whether its absence in species and individuals is methodological (false negative with respect to trait) or ontological (true negative with respect to trait) in nature; and (3) proposals of hypotheses to account phylogenetically for the existence of inter- and intraspecies differences in mirror self-recognition are premature. Before hypotheses such as these are advanced, the impact of rearing conditions on mirror self-recognition should be examined further. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Female macaques and baboons are intensely interested in other females' infants, but provide little direct care for them. The selective factors that shape this strong attraction to neonates may differ from those that shape alloparental care in other taxa. The attraction to neonates may have evolved because (1) it enhances young females' acquisition of maternal skills, (2) it is a form of reproductive competition among females, or (3) it is a by-product of selection for appropriate maternal care. I studied patterns of infant handling in a large group of bonnet macaques, Macaca radiata, at the California Primate Research Center dt the University of California, Davis. Infant handling was generally gentle and nonintrusive, although females sometimes tugged on infants. Females were more strongly attracted to infants than were males, regardless of their age. Adult females handled infants as often as subadult females did. Male and female infants were handled at equal rates, and rates of handling towards all infants declined sharply as infants matured. Infants were handled by related females at higher rates than by unrelated females, and at higher rates by higher-ranking females than by lower-ranking females. The data provide little support for the 'learning to mother' hypothesis, because older females were as interested in infants as were subadult females. Although mothers were reluctant to allow their infants to be handled, the data do not support the reproductive competition hypothesis because patterns of infant handling did not match patterns of harassment of infants. The data provide a better fit to the by-product hypothesis. Females were most strongly attracted to infants when maternal care was most critical for infant survival and females of all ages were strongly attracted to infants. Taken together, these data suggest that a strong attraction to infants is favoured by selection because females that are highly responsive to infants make good mothers.

AB Using juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, we tested predictions arising from dynamic optimization models of foraging under predation risk. Coho juveniles from two size groups raised in the laboratory were individually fed varying food rations. Their willingness to risk Predation was measured as the time to resume foraging after presentation of a predator model. Small fish (mean weight 1.5 g) resumed feeding earlier than larger fish (3.5 g) as predicted by dynamic models under summer photoperiod but not under autumn photoperiod. Contrary to predictions, larger fish did not increase risk taking and small fish decreased risk taking between summer and autumn treatments. Food ration significantly influenced time to resume feeding only in small coho. A simple mechanistic model we proposed to explain feeding motivation under risk as a function of body size and prior growth rate was not sufficient to explain observed variation in risk taking. This study suggests that coho salmon use photoperiod and their own body size as cues for long-term, state-dependent adjustments of feeding behaviour. The lower risk taking of larger fish is probably an example of asset protection, whereby larger animals accept less predation risk to protect their greater accumulated fitness value. The decrease of risk taking in small fish in the autumn was possibly caused by a switch of life history trajectory towards delayed smelting.

AB In ants, young queens can found new colonies independently (without the help of workers) or dependently (with the help of workers). It has been suggested that differences in the mode of colony founding strongly influence queen survival and colony development. This is because independent queens are constrained to produce a worker force rapidly, before they deplete their body reserves and to resist the intense intercolony competition during the founding stage. By contrast, queens that found colonies dependently remain with the workers, which probably results in a lower mortality rate and earlier production of reproductive offspring. Consequently, in species that found independently, queens of incipient colonies are expected to produce mostly worker brood by laying a lower fraction of haploid (male) eggs than queens in mature colonies; such a difference would not occur in species founding dependently. We compared the primary sex ratio (proportion of male-determined eggs) laid by queens in incipient and mature colonies of two ant species, Lasius niger and Linepithema humile, showing independent and dependent modes of colony founding, respectively. As predicted, L. niger queens of incipient colonies laid a lower proportion of haploid eggs than queens from mature colonies. By contrast, queens of L. humile laid a similar proportion of haploid eggs in both incipient and mature colonies. These results provide the first evidence that (1) the primary sex ratio varies according to the mode of colony foundation, and (2) queens can adjust the primary sex ratio according to the life history stage of the colony in ants.

AB An important means of investigating gains and losses to prey caused by mimicry is through mathematical or computer constructs which represent and explore limited aspects of mimicry situations. Such studies use virtual predators which are usually simple automata, 'robots' that, through simple rules, vary virtual attack rates on virtual insect prey. In this paper I consider the effect of variations in predator memory and learning on mimicry dynamics. When there is mimicry between unequally noxious prey, the way that memory is modelled is shown to be crucial. If forgetting rates are fixed, an increase in the density of the least defended prey produces monotonic gains or losses in protection. However, if forgetting rate is inversely related in some way to degree of noxiousness of the prey then attack rates initially rise with the density of the least defended prey, reach a cusp and then fall. I show that the generation of this highly unconventional up-down result appears to be independent of variations in learning rate. This work shows how sensitive the predictions of virtual predators may be to relatively small changes in behavioural rules. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Uniform discrimination of pattern orientation by honeybees

ID APIS-MELLIFERA; VISION; BEES; RECOGNITION; INSECTS; NEURONS
AB To explore how honeybees, Apis cerana, discriminate the orientation of patterns, we trained workers to discriminate between a black stripe of a certain orientation on a white disc and a pure white disc. We tested trained bees for their ability to discriminate between the trained orientation and deviations from it. This was done either in a dual choice situation where the bees had to choose between the trained orientation and one deviation from it at a time, or in a multiple choice situation where bees had to choose simultaneously between the trained orientation and 11 successive deviations from it. In the dual choice situation, bees did not discriminate behaviourally between the trained orientation and deviations up to 25 degrees, whereas in a multiple choice situation, they discriminated between the trained orientation and a deviation of 15 degrees or more. Thus, orientation can be analysed more precisely in multiple choice experiments. The response of the bees was independent of the orientation of the trained orientation; the 12 different trained orientations all yielded identical results. This finding, considered together with a model that we present for orientation discrimination, suggests that at least three, orientation-sensitive channels (a neuron or a set of neurons that respond maximally to a particular orientation) participate in the analysis of pattern orientation.

AB Mating systems correspond to particular ecological conditions and result from proximate interactions between individuals. We compared the mating preferences of female mice of two species: the house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, and the mound-builder mouse, Mus spicilegus. Because of differences in their habitat, we expected to observe differences in their sexual preferences. We studied female preferences for a familiar or an unfamiliar male and the occurrence of copulation with the unfamiliar male, during two states of female sexual activity: (1) the postpartum oestrus of paired females, to evaluate the stability of their sexual partnership; and (2) the oestrus of females familiarized with a male, to study the mechanisms underlying their sexual preferences. In the polygamous house mouse, postpartum oestrous females did not show a clear preference between their familiar male and the unfamiliar one. Moreover, oestrous females, familiarized with a male (without sexual interactions), preferred an unfamiliar male and copulated with him. In contrast, postpartum oestrous females and oestrous females of M. spicilegus preferred their familiar male and rarely copulated with the unfamiliar male. This study indicates a strong pair bond in established breeding pairs in M. spicilegus and shows that this bond can be established by familiarization, which is not the case in M. m. domesticus. Our study suggests the existence of monogamous traits in M. spicilegus in contrast to the polygamous M. m. domesticus. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We surveyed 12 populations of the wolf spider Schizocosa crassipes (Walckenaer) and S. nr. crassipes in Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida, in the U.S, to determine the extent of variation in male courtship behaviour when observed in standard laboratory conditions. We observed variation in both the frequency of occurrence and the sequence of the four principal male courtship behaviours and, when compared statistically, most of these behaviours differed between populations. Although there was no clinal pattern in the frequency of courtship behaviour, we observed geographically consistent patterns in the sequence in which male courtship behaviours are displayed. We conducted two subsequent studies to determine whether sexual isolation among selected populations existed. In the first study, we performed male-female reciprocal crosses of brush-legged spiders (S. nr. crassipes) between two populations from the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta physiographical region and one population from the Loess Bluff region of Mississippi and measured mating success, number of matings that produced egg sacs, and the number of egg sacs that hatched young. The results of that experiment suggest that sexual isolation occurs among populations in different physiographical regions but not between populations within regions of the state. In a second crossing study, we paired the brush-legged spiders from one of the Mississippi physiographical regions (Yazoo-Mississippi Delta) with Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz) from Ohio. The results of that cross suggest that the Mississippi Delta population is more similar to the northern S. ocreata populations than to S. crassipes. We discuss the results of the crossing experiments in terms of what was revealed about geographical patterns in male courtship behaviour. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Parental recycling of nestling faeces in the common swift
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID FECAL SAC REMOVAL; APUS-APUS; COST; PASSERINES
AB Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain why parent birds eat their nestlings' faecal sacs. Among them, the parental nutrition hypothesis suggests that faeces may provide alternative food to parent birds, while the economic disposal hypothesis proposes that eating faeces represents an economical alternative to carrying them away when birds are engaged in parental activities. In both cases the elimination of faeces could prevent contamination of the nest (nest sanitation). In the present study, we tested these hypotheses on the common swift, Apus apus. The behaviour of parents at the nest was videotaped and analysed in relation to sex, brood size and nestling age. The parents regularly swallowed faecal sacs during the first 3 weeks after the nestlings hatched, but only occasionally thereafter until they fledged. Both sexes ingested sacs at a similar rate in the first week after hatching, and ingestion rate was directly related to the number of feeding visits. Females ate significantly more sacs than males overall. The parents consumed faeces after actively searching into and around the nest cup, also during brooding spells. However, brooding decreased with increasing brood size nd nestling age, while faeces consumption increased. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that parent birds ingest their nestling faeces to recycle water and nutrients, making the 'best of a bad job' during periods of high energetic requirements. In addition, ingestion of faeces may be an alternative strategy to delay hunger and to:facilitate the allocation of food to the offspring. As the nestlings grew, parents ate fewer faecal sacs. The increased begging behaviour of the young appeared to be an important factor in determining the decline of;faeces consumption, as it hindered parents approaching the nest.

AB We tested the hypothesis that sexual asymmetry in mating costs affects choice of schooling partner in fish. Female guppies, Poecilia reticulata, from the Tacarigua River, Trinidad, associated preferentially with other (familiar) females from their natural wild school, while males did not show such a preference. This implies that wild guppy schools are not random assemblages of conspecifics. Females form the core of natural schools while males seem to trade off the potential advantages of schooling with familiar conspecifics against increased mobility in search of mating opportunities. We discuss the implications of these findings in relation to cooperative behaviour, gene flow and population differentiation. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID GENETIC SIMILARITY; HATCHING FAILURE; BIRDS; POPULATION; DISPERSAL;

AB In blue tits, Pants caeruleus, and other wild birds, matings between lose relatives or between genetically similar individuals are associated with fitness costs, often in terms of lower hatching success of the eggs. If individuals cannot assess their genetic similarity to potential mates, those fitness costs may be hard to avoid; however, they may use the proportion of unhatched eggs in their clutch as a cue for their mate choice in the next season. We tested this hypothesis using data from a long-term population study on blue and great tits, Parus major. Divorce in response to inbreeding depression can be considered a special case of the 'incompatibility hypothesis'. As predicted from this hypothesis, both male and female blue tits benefited from divorce when part of their clutch failed to hatch. There was no evidence however, that divorce in blue or great tits was related to the presence of unhatched eggs in the nest. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated the effects of genes controlling melanism on levels and patterns of activity, potential nonvisual components of fitness, of adult Mediterranean flour moths, Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (1879). Six genotypes of two melanic strains (Ala nigra and black) were used. We monitored continuously the walking or flight activity of 45 mated females per genotype during the third night of their lives, using automatic electrostatic techniques to carry out the measurements. Although there was high individual variation within genotypes, bb (melanic) females were more active than the two nonmelanic genotypes of the black strain (b+, ++) because they tended to show more bouts of activity. There were no differences in the average length of these bouts, or in the timing of initial and final activity. Overall, the females of the black strain were significantly more active than the females of the Ala nigra strain. The results are discussed in the context of the evolution of melanism in moths.

AB The development and occurrence of anorexia, the voluntary reduction in food intake during parasitic infections in animals, is somewhat paradoxical and contrary to conventional wisdom and expectation. We take the view that its occurrence is an evolved, costly behavioural adaptation which serves a function. Five such functional and general hypotheses to account for it are developed: (1) anorexia is induced by the parasite for its own benefit; (2) food intake decreases to starve parasites; (3) the negative effect on the host's energetic efficiency during parasitic diseases has a direct effect on food consumption; (4) food intake decreases for the purpose of promoting an effective immune response in the host; and (5) anorexia allows the host to become more selective in its diet, and thus select foods that either minimize the risk of infection or are high in antiparasitic compounds. Only hypotheses (4) and (5) survive the comparison for consistency with the physiological, metabolic and behavioural alterations that occur during the development of parasitic infections, and with the rule of generality (i.e. account for its occurrence in both protozoan and helminth infections). Both surviving hypotheses will need further experimental testing for their support or rejection, and such experiments are proposed. Also, the advantages and consequences of viewing anorexia during parasitic infections within a functional framework are discussed. These arise from the recognition that anorexia is a disease-coping strategy, part of the mechanism of recognition of parasite invasion by the immune system, which leads to a modification of the host's feeding behaviour.

AB Male pigeons, Columba livia, employ intense mate guarding and frequent copulation apparently as strategies to ensure their paternity. The aim of this study was to investigate the benefits to females of mate guarding by males and frequent copulation. Field observations showed that females initiated the majority of copulations and females that solicited copulations more frequently were guarded more closely by their partner. Experimental removal of guarding male partners showed that: (1) unguarded, fertile females suffered increased harassment from extrapair males which reduced their foraging efficiency; g-nd (2) unguarded, fertile females did not seek copulations with extrapair males. Various explanations for frequent pair copulation initiated by females are discussed and we conclude that female pigeons trade pair copulations for protection (mate guarding) against sexual harassment from other males.

AB In social foraging, scroungers take a disproportionately large share of the food found relative to their own food-searching efforts, while producers find more food than they manage to monopolize. We present a model of social foraging acknowledging the finder's advantage and foraging role asymmetries among individuals but incorporating the possibility that producers and scroungers differ in vigilance level and in vulnerability to predators. This allows simultaneous examination of both foraging benefits and anti-predatory aspects of grouping behaviour. Instead of seeking for equal payoff conditions, we first look for groups in which foraging character combinations and anti-predatory properties of producers and scroungers minimize the phenotype-specific predation hazard over food-intake rate, R-i/I-i, that is, fixed phenotype R-i/I-i minima. In the second approach, we allow individuals to change their foraging status to achieve lower R-i/I-i and look for combinations where it no longer pays for either producers or scroungers to change their roles, that is, evolutionarily stable group compositions, ESS. Various character combinations allow the phenotype-specific minima. In most cases, however, producers' and scroungers' minima are achievable only in different group compositions. The ESS combinations of producers and scroungers deviate widely from those combinations yielding phenotype-specific minima of R-i/I-i. If individuals are allowed to be flexible in adopting either a producer or a scrounger role, ESS group compositions will emerge, even though they are more expensive for both producers and scroungers in terms of R-i/I-i than group compositions yielding the phenotype-specific R-i/I-i minima.

ID ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE; ALARM CALLS; BEHAVIOR
AB We observed the species and numbers of mobbing birds and their effects on a large, nocturnal, bird-eating predator, the powerful owl, together with the pattern of owl predation on mobbing and non-mobbing species. Owls were mobbed on 35 occasions by seven of 44 species of forest birds at a site composed of open forest (88% by area) and rainforest (12%). The majority of bouts involved individuals of a single species, although mixed groups were observed on nine occasions. Regular mobbers were between 4 and 26% of the owls' body weight. Owls abandoned their daytime roosts during 26% of bouts and responded by calling or actively monitoring mobbers during 54% of bouts. Mobbing appeared to explain why owls roosted in rainforest significantly more often than expected by its availability, mobbing being significantly less frequent in rainforest than in open forest. Only one mobbing species regularly occupied rainforest and the canopy of roosts in rainforest was denser than that in open forest, thus reducing the chances of an owl being detected by potential mobbers. Twelve species of forest birds were within the range of prey size of the powerful owl (75-800 g): six were mobbers and six non-mobbers. The frequency of owl predation on non-mobbers was 8.75 times that on mobbers. The species in this study took a high risk by mobbing a very large predator, but benefited by greatly reducing their chances of predation. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The activity levels of Mallorcan midwife toad tadpoles, Alytes muletensis, were compared in two natural torrent pools which differed in their use by predatory viperine snakes, Natrix maura. Activity levels were lower in a pool regularly used by snakes than they were in a snake-free pool, but were reduced in both pools when snakes were experimentally introduced in nylon bags. In the presence of snakes, however, activity was more suppressed in the pool that was usually snake-free. Corresponding reductions in activity were also observed when tadpoles were treated with chemical cues from Mallorcan N. maura in a gravitational flow-through system. However, tadpoles failed to respond to chemical cues from other species of amphibian-eating snakes, or even to those from N. maura collected from a different population in mainland Spain. As none of the snakes used had previously eaten midwife toads, the responses cannot be related to previous diet, and seem to be specific to those N. maura from the island of Mallorca. As viperine snakes were probably introduced to Mallorca about 2000 years ago, the evolution of anti-predator behaviour in midwife toad tadpoles must have occurred relatively recently.

AB Adult great spotted cuckoos, Clamator glandarius, damage the eggs of their magpie, Pica pica, host without removing or eating them. The number of damaged magpie eggs was recorded in 360 parasitized nests of which 62.2% contained between one and eight damaged magpie eggs. Egg-destroying behaviour may be adaptive if it reduces nestling competition and/or enhances the hatching success of the cuckoo. To clarify the role of egg destruction for the reproductive success of great spotted cuckoos, unparasitized magpie nests were experimentally parasitized (without egg damage) by introducing cuckoo eggs or chicks. Egg damage was common in parasitized nests but the eggs were not damaged by the hosts. Egg damage increased the breeding success of the cuckoos, by both reducing the number of competing host chicks in the nest and increasing the likelihood that late-laid cuckoo eggs would hatch.

AB Scent markings (urine and faeces) of small mammals are visible in ultraviolet (UV) light. Diurnal kestrels, Falco tinnunculus, use them as a cue to find areas of food abundance. We studied whether vole-eating, nocturnal Tengmalm's owls, Aegolius funereus, can see vole scent marks using W-vision. In a laboratory experiment, 14 young (less than 6 months old) and 14 adult (more than 6 months old) owls were individually given a choice between four adjacent arenas: (1) an arena with vole urine and faeces in UV light; (2) an arena with vole urine and faeces in visible light; (3) a clean arena in UV light; and (4) a clean arena in visible light. Owls did not prefer any of the four arenas. Our results suggest that Tengmalm's owls probably do not use UV light as a cue to detect vole scent marks.

AB Testosterone is an important determinant of spatial activity in male birds. Using radiotelemetry, male dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, were followed during the period when their mates were fertile to investigate the relationship between testosterone and behaviours (territoriality, consorting with female) through which males might guard paternity. Males with experimentally elevated testosterone levels (T-males) and control males (C-males) did not differ significantly in their use of space during this period. T-males and C-males occupied similar home ranges, used similar-sized core areas (areas enclosing 95% of all activity), spent similar amounts of time close to their mates, and experienced similar intrusion rates onto their territories. Experimentally elevating testosterone above control levels did not detectably affect the spatial activity of male juncos during the female fertile period, although earlier studies have shown that its effects are pronounced during other stages of the nesting cycle.

AB Scent over-marking is a common form of competitive advertisement among many species of mammals. Recent observations in golden hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus, have suggested that individuals have specialized mechanisms for interpretation of and response to such over-marks. In this study, we examined whether meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, have similar abilities. Female voles were first exposed to anogenital scent marks of two males and were then tested in a Y-maze for their preferences for whole-body odours of these two males. Experiments were run using a variety of configurations of scent marks during the exposure phase, but all experiments yielded consistent results. If the scent marks of the two males overlapped, females later preferred the whole-body odours of the male whose scent was on top; if the two scent marks did not overlap, females showed no preference. Females also preferred odours of familiar males over novel males, and preferred both top-scent and bottom-scent males over novel males. The results suggest that female voles can tell which individual's scent is on top in an over-mark and that they prefer this top-scent male, even though they know that both males' scents were present during the exposure phase. We suggest that these odour preferences reflect mate preferences and discuss possible reasons why females might prefer top-scent males. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Fighting behaviour in adult male copperheads, Agkistrodon contortrix (Serpentes, Viperidae), was investigated in the laboratory to assess the relative importance of body size and type of agonistic experience as determinants of dominance and mating success. Seven experiments were conducted. In each experiment, trials were run using two adult males and one female in a large arena. The first experiment tested the influence of body size. All males tested had no recent fighting experience for 6-12 months, and one male of each pair was 8-10% longer in snout-vent length and had greater mass. In all cases, larger males won fights and were first to locate, court and guard females; thus, larger snout-vent length was an important determinant of fighting success and priority of access to potential mates. Males with either winning or losing experience from the first experiment were used in six subsequent experiments on the relative importance of snout-vent length and agonistic experience in attaining dominance and mating success. Losing experience had a greater effect than snout-vent length on subsequent fighting success and gaining priority of access to females. Winning experience, in contrast, did not increase the probability of winning subsequent fights; however, winners appeared more excitable and none deferred from challenges of other males. The asymmetry in effects of single experiences of victory and defeat is consistent with studies on other vertebrates and supports the hypothesis that losing lights in males negatively affects behaviour directly related to their fitness.

ID FORAGING STRATEGIES; ECOLOGICAL CAUSES; DIMORPHISM; AVAILABILITY;
   BEHAVIOR
AB The American kestrel, Falco sparverius, has sex-related differences in habitat use during the non-breeding season, with females occupying more open habitats than males. Two competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon: (1) males and females prefer different habitats, and (2) males and females prefer similar habitats, but larger females exclude smaller males from preferred areas. This study experimentally investigated habitat selection in wintering kestrels by temporarily removing kestrels from areas, and then observing the numbers and sex of the kestrels that occupied vacated areas. The home ranges of 20 birds (10 males and 10 females) were mapped and their occupants removed. Areas vacated in early winter (November 1994) were filled more quickly than those vacated in late winter (February 1995). Areas previously held by females were reoccupied more frequently than were those previously occupied by males. Female kestrels reoccupied vacated female areas more than vacated male areas. Male kestrels reoccupied vacated female and male areas equally. The results demonstrate that (1) high-quality kestrel habitat may be limited in the non-breeding season, (2) vacated areas are more likely to be reoccupied in the early winter than in late winter, (3) female kestrels appear at an advantage relative to males in occupying scarce and competed-for areas, and (4) male kestrels will use female areas when female occupants have been removed. It is hypothesized that open habitats are preferred over less open habitats because the former offer reduced risk of predation from bird-eating hawks.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID PANTHERA-LEO
AB Lionesses, Panthera leo, in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, assess the odds of winning group-territorial contests by counting the number of opponents they hear roaring. They will approach intruders aggressively only if they outnumber them. Here the lionesses in the Serengeti are compared with another population living nearby but in strikingly different ecological circumstances. The lions of Ngorongoro Crater live at much higher densities owing to year-round availability of non-migratory prey species, but also suffer higher mortality from fighting. Playback experiments showed that lionesses in the crater differ from those in the Serengeti by approaching 'intruders' more quickly when the odds of winning are low. This increased aggression is interpreted in terms of the greater difficulty of holding a territory at high population density. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Heyes' (1994, Anim. Behav., 97, 909-919; 1995, Anim. Behav., 50, 1533-1542) recent account of chimpanzees', Pan troglodytes, reactions to mirrors challenged the view that they are capable of recognizing the equivalence between their mirror images and their physical appearance. In particular, she argued that observations that chimpanzees touch surreptitiously placed marks on their faces while in front of mirrors can be explained as an interaction between ambient levels of face touching and procedural artefacts of the anaesthetization and markings of the subjects. Using new analytical techniques, data are reported that falsify the central predictions generated by her account and confirm predictions derived from the self-recognition model.

AB Nuchal humps, crests, combs, horns or gibbosities occur in the predorsal region of many kinds of bony fishes, usually on top of the head. The role of such humps, when dimorphic, has been suggested in a few instances but never tested. We explored the function of the nuchal hump in a Nicaraguan cichlid fish, 'Cichlasoma' citrinellum. In nature, the male develops a modest hump only when ready to mate; it never becomes as large as in well-fed captive males. We entertained two sets of hypotheses, non-communicatory and communicatory, to explain the hump. Based on information about behaviour and natural history, we rejected the non-communicatory hypotheses, which were fat storage, mechanical advantage in a fight, improved hydrodynamics and anti-predation. Among the communicatory hypotheses, we favoured a supernormal-stimulus response, suggesting inter- and intra-sexual selection. We also considered recognition of sex and species, as indicated by a unimodal response by females or an inverse supernormal response by males. We tested these hypotheses by presenting to male and to female subjects four dummies whose nuchal humps varied from none to medium to large to huge. The results were interpreted in light of additional information about natural history. The hypothesis of sex recognition is the most parsimonious. If sexual selection is operating, it would be a unique case of conflicting sensory filters: one would favour an enlarged hump that indicates male fitness, opposed by another filter that discriminates against a yet larger hump that interferes with species recognition.

   FLY; DISCRIMINATION; EXPRESSION; PLASTICITY; SPECIATION
AB The courtship behaviour of Drosophila melanogaster is affected by the light regime in which the animals were reared as adults. The light regime has a positive assortative effect on mating. To investigate further this surprising behavioural plasticity, flies were reared in constant darkness (DD), in a light/dark-cycle (LD) or in constant light (LL) and all combinations of male/female pairs were tested. Males and females that had grown up in the same light regime had the shortest copulation latencies. Tests of courtship in total darkness confirmed that this positive assortative mating pattern does not depend upon use of vision. The results of an analysis of the behavioural subcomponents of courtship for pairs of LD females with LD and with DD males suggest that the assortative effect is mediated by copulation attempts of the males which are instrumental in reducing copulation latency. However, this behaviour was not directly influenced by the male's rearing conditions, but rather via the female's response to the male's behaviour. The male's orientation to the front of the female and the female's declining locomotor activity were critical parameters in this communication loop.

AB Western toad, Bufo boreas, tadpoles were collected from a lake in the Cascade Mountains of central Oregon, where they occur in sympatry with backswimmers, Notonecta spp., giant waterbugs, Lethocerus americanus, common garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis, roughskin newts, Taricha granulosa and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Backswimmers, waterbugs and snakes prey on toad tadpoles. Newts and trout are potential tadpole predators, but they find toad tadpoles unpalatable. In laboratory tests. groups of tadpoles responded with anti-predator behaviour when exposed to live backswimmers, waterbugs and snakes, but not when exposed to either newts or trout. In subsequent tests, when only chemical cues from the stimulus animals were presented, the toad tadpoles again responded to backswimmers, waterbugs and snakes, but not to either newts or trout. When tests were conducted using only visual cues, tadpoles did not respond with anti-predator behaviour to any of the heterospecifics with the possible exception of garter snakes. These results show that western toad tadpoles can distinguish between predatory and non-predatory heterospecifics with which they co-occur, and that predator recognition by toad tadpoles is primarily based on chemical cues.

   EVOLUTION; ALYTES; NESTS; MALES; FROG
AB In species with male parental care, multiple clutching is the provisioning of care to the eggs or offspring of two or more females simultaneously. Multiple clutching represents a strategy by which males reduce the reproductive costs associated with male parental care relative to the reproductive gains. Although multiple clutching is common in two species of midwife toads (Alytes obstetricans and A. cisternasii), double clutching in the Majorcan midwife toad, A. muletensis, is rare and triple clutching has never been observed. In this paper, the reasons for the low frequency of double clutching in A. muletensis relative to the other species are examined. Two hypotheses were experimentally disproved: double clutching is not limited to particularly large males, and females do not prefer to mate with non-brooding than brooding males. The low incidence of double clutching in A. muletensis appears to result from a time constraint on males. Males only advertise for second clutches within 3 days of the first. This time limit may have evolved as a result of energetic constraints on either the duration of the brooding period of males, or the developmental plasticity of larvae. A model was constructed which illustrates that if females mate randomly with respect to the brooding status of males, the time limit for obtaining a second clutch partially explains the differences in frequencies of double clutching observed between A. muletensis and the other species of midwife toads. The female inter-clutch interval and the male brooding period are also likely to contribute significantly to the rate of double clutching in a population.

AB Naked mole-rats, Heterocephalus glaber, are eusocial, subterranean rodents that inhabit arid regions of northeastern Africa. They feed on bulbs and tubers that are patchily distributed. Nests are often located far from the nearest food source through a labyrinth of tunnels. Two captive colonies were studied to determine whether successful foragers recruit colony mates and, if so, how. Individuals that found a new food source typically gave a special vocalization on their way back to the nest and waved the food around once they got there. Colony mates preferentially visited the site where the initial forager had obtained food, often bypassing alternative sites containing the same type of food. Recruits preferred to use tunnels that had been traversed by the 'scout' rather than an alternative pathway to the same food, regardless of whether they had to turn in the same or the opposite direction from that of the scout to enter the previously used pathway. Recruits preferred tunnels that the scout had recently used over tunnels that were recently traversed by another colony mate carrying the same type of food. When tunnels traversed by the scout were replaced with clean substitutes or with tunnels that were recently traversed by another colony mate carrying the same type of food, recruits showed no pathway preferences. Results indicate that naked mole-rats follow each other's (odour) trails to food. There are intriguing parallels between the foraging recruitment system of H. glaber and those of other social vertebrates and insects. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB One of the most important relationships in parasitoid behavioural ecology is that between adult female size and fitness. However, surprisingly few studies have attempted to assess size-related components of fitness beyond fecundity and longevity. This paper provides a more complete appraisal of the size-fitness relationship in the bethylid wasp Goniozus nephantidis by investigating the influences of female size and ownership-status on the outcome of owner-intruder contests for paralysed hosts. Both influenced contest outcomes: larger females tended to win, but outcome was modified in favour of owners when intruders were only moderately larger. Aggressive behaviour during contests is described. The size-fitness relationship, based on fecundity and longevity as correlates of fitness, has previously been used to estimate optimal clutch size in G. nephantidis and a large discrepancy was found between observed and predicted clutch sizes. Here it is argued that because female fitness is determined, at least in part, by body size relative to competitors, an evolutionarily stable strategy approach is required to calculate optimal clutch size when host ownership contests occur. Clutch sizes could be influenced greatly and this provides a candidate explanation for the previously reported discrepancy. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB In species that initiate multiple broods in a single season there is usually a trade-off between the number of young in the first brood, and the timing and occurrence of subsequent broods in the same season. The hypothesis that experimental reduction of clutch size reduces the duration of post-hedging care was tested in great tits, Parus major, and the effect of second clutches on post-fledging care was also investigated. Parental care continued for 20 days (range 10-32 days) after fledging. Investment in successive clutches overlapped, and the duration of post-hedging care was positively correlated with the inter-clutch interval. Second clutches reduced the female's contribution to post-fledging care. The clutch size manipulation did not affect the duration of post-fledging care. It is concluded that factors other than the duration of post-hedging care mediate the effect of clutch size manipulations on second clutches, and an alternative hypothesis is discussed.

AB It has been proposed that mate guarding is the primary paternity insurance in birds, and only those species in which the male is compelled to leave his mate unattended during the fertile period resort to frequent copulation as a means of assuring paternity. A higher frequency of both extra-pair copulation (EPC) and extra-pair paternity (EPP) has been predicted in non-guarding species. These predictions were examined in Eurasian kestrels, Falco tinnunculus, breeding in western Finland. During the course of a 3-year vole cycle, the mean within-pair copulation frequency was 0.72 per h and the mean number of extra-pair intrusions 0.07 per h. The proportion of EPCs was only 1% of copulations. The within-pair copulation frequency was higher in a year of increasing food abundance (1991) than in the years of decreasing (1992) and low food abundance (1990), although the kestrel breeding density was lower in 1990 than in 1991-1992. Males spent more time mate guarding in 1991-1992 than in 1990 (overall mean 40%). Single-locus DNA profiling revealed EPP in 7% of 27 broods and 5% of 112 offspring in 1991 but none in 1990 or 1992 (19 and 29 broods, respectively). Kestrel males successfully used both frequent pair copulation and mate guarding as complementary paternity guards. The low frequency of EPP may reflect the importance of male parental care in determining the reproductive success of raptors. Females may jeopardize future aid from their mates by soliciting EPCs from intruders. This strategy might markedly reduce female fitness, because the male is the main provider for female and young from before egg laying until the late nestling period.

AB Males often compete for mates using alternative tactics whose relative success could be simultaneously influenced by four factors: subsequent behaviour, physiological state, the frequency of expression of alternative tactics and the density of competing males. Here the payoffs to two alternative male mating tactics (call and satellite) were examined in anurans using a stochastic dynamic game. The basic model considers an iteroparous species with a prolonged breeding season and fairly low energetic costs and predation risks. The model assumes that female chorus attendance is affected by weather, time of year and male chorusing intensity. Results show that interactions between energetic costs of calling, density-dependent predation risk and female arrival rates, and frequency-dependent mating success produce distinct temporal waves of male chorusing despite continuously favourable environmental conditions. Relative to second-year males, first-year males attended choruses less often and were more likely to become satellites. When the energetic costs of calling were increased, waves became shorter and less frequent, and some older calling males switched to satellite behaviour. Satellites were less common when breeding season length was constrained by extrinsic factors such as seasonal weather patterns. Extrinsic constraints may also affect system stability: if female arrival rates are independent of male chorusing intensity, an evolutionarily stable strategy occurs only if the breeding season is short. Even without extrinsic constraints, the breeding season may be short if predation rates on adults are sufficiently high, or if satellites intercept a large fraction of incoming females. Thus, the 'explosive' breeding systems observed in many anuran species could result from either biotic or abiotic causes. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

High densities of unguarded females were simulated by exposing free-ranging males to strange female scent, and males and females were temporarily removed to create vacancies. Despite the finding that males are capable of defending resources for more than one female, paired males did not leave their territory to search for a presumably available female, nor did they invade a territory of an unpaired female neighbour. Only unpaired males left their territories and claimed neighbouring widows with their territories. This suggests that male dikdik do not attempt to acquire more than one female, and therefore appear to be obligately monogamous. It is proposed that the terms facultative and obligate monogamy should exclusively describe the flexibility of the mating system, without implications of parental roles. Dikdik then are obligate and uniparental monogamists. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Two experiments were performed to determine the effect of past territoriality and mating success on subsequent dominance and ability to attract females. First, in 14 staged, pair-wise encounters, the development of nuptial coloration and agonistic behaviour was examined in two types of males: previously territorial (PT) and previously non-territorial (PNT) males. Previously territorial males developed a more intense nuptial coloration and won all contests. Second, to test the males' ability to attract females, other factors were controlled that could have affected female mate choice, such as male size, quality of breeding substrate and male-male interactions. In 40 trials, PT males were more active, developed a more intense nuptial coloration, courted females more vigorously, spawned sooner and had a higher mating success than PNT males. Thus, in pupfish, Cyprinodon pecosensis, previous reproductive history is a good indicator of both dominance and mating success. Only males in good physical condition achieve high mating success, and both intra- and inter-sexual selection are important in maintaining the close correlation between expression of nuptial coloration, a second sexual trait, and other male attributes, such as physical condition and vigour, that allow a male to secure and defend a territory against rivals and to attract and spawn with females.

ID LEPTOTHORAX-GREDLERI; DOMINANCE ORDERS
AB Colonies of the ant Leptothorax unifasciatus (Latr.) were examined for the presence of spatial associations between the single queen and each individually marked worker. The results present, for the first time, evidence of queen-worker interactions which would be difficult, if not impossible, to detect solely on the basis of direct observations of behaviour. The spatial description of queen activity in nine colonies skewed that (1) the queen tended to be the adult ant closest to the centre of the egg pile (the colony centre), (2) she usually had the smallest spatial fidelity zone (SFZ), i.e. zone of movement within the nest that is of limited area and specific to an individual, and (3) her SFZ did not appear to expand or contract seasonally in contrast to the SFZs of the workers. In six of the colonies randomization tests were applied to the distances between the synchronous spatial positions of the queen and each worker during each of 5 days of observation. These tests established that some workers associated positively with the queen while other workers associated negatively with her. The numbers of these two types of queen-worker associations were not significantly different. There was no significant difference between workers in positive and negative queen-worker associations with regard to their positions in the colony over the whole 5-day period of observation. Positions were measured as the median distance of each ant from the colony centre. In some cases, however, workers in either type of queen-worker association had positions significantly nearer to the colony centre than those in no association with the queen. The median distance, over a day, between the queen and a worker tended to be smaller for workers in positive queen-worker associations than for those in negative queen-worker associations.

ID ACOUSTIC CRITERIA; MATE CHOICE
AB In nearly all female choice experiments with anurans, the values of acoustic properties of experimental stimuli have been fixed. In nature, however, a female usually experiences an array of calls in which acoustic properties, especially dynamic ones, differ between males in variability as well as in mean values. High variability per se does not make a synthetic call more or less attractive to female grey treefrogs,Hyla versicolor, than a non-variable or low-variability call with about the same mean values of pulse number per call, call period, or both. Females did prefer a low-variability alternative with a slightly higher number of sound pulses per unit time than the variable stimulus, suggesting that females can resolve small differences in mean values between the calls of different males despite considerable within-male variability.

AB After the nuptial flight, queens of Lasius niger occur in very high densities on the ground. Queens in this study avoided areas frequented by workers of established colonies, leading to additional clumping of nest foundations. In the field 18% of colony foundation-nests contained more than one queen (pleometrosis). Queens showed neither preference for nor avoidance of pleometrotic founding, indicating that foundress associations are facultative, promoted by crowding and intense inter-colony competition. Indeed, under laboratory conditions brood raiding occurred. In this situation groups of queens had an advantage because they produced more workers initially and the colony with the most workers was more successful in brood raids. The queens in a colony fight until only one is left alive. Removal of workers delayed fighting and addition of workers led to premature fights, indicating that the presence of workers induces fighting amongst the queens. As soon as workers started to forage, additional queens negatively affected colony productivity: colonies with three or four queens produced fewer workers than colonies with one queen. Workers also influenced the outcome of queen-queen interactions, by preferentially feeding the most fertile queen, which was therefore the most likely to survive. Neither weight of the queens by the time of the nuptial flight nor injections of juvenile hormone affected the outcome of fights between queens.

AB Previous interactions with conspecifics influenced the pattern, frequency and intensity of agonistic behaviour in the held cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. Tactile contact appeared to be the most important sensory cue responsible for the observed shifts in behaviour. Contact with other adult males promoted the production of aggressive song both during and after tights between males. However, individually housed males and males with restricted contact with conspecifics (once per day for 5 days) produced their aggressive song only at the end of an agonistic encounter. These two patterns of agonistic behaviour may reflect alternate fighting strategies. Prior experience influences whether sensory cues from a conspecific will initate agonistic behaviour. After males lost a fight, they displayed no further agonistic behaviour for 10 min but then gradually recovered their agonistic behaviour within an hour. This may be an important mechanism in preventing losing males from re-engaging a more powerful rival. Females were much less likely than males to attack conspecifics when food was plentiful. When food was scarce, females fought more often, and more successfully, than males for the contested resource.

   SELECTION; BEHAVIOR; SPARROWS; LOGIC; NEED
AB Confusion over the validity of 'conventional signalling' may have resulted at least in part because it has been used to refer to different concepts. The main aim of this paper is to expose the source of this confusion, not to prescribe a particular solution. Two key current senses of conventional signals are identified: (1) as strategic correlates of quality (or, more generally, of the parameter about which information is contained in the signal's message); (2) as signals whose design is arbitrarily related to their message. The sometimes difficult relationships between these two senses and other concepts in the signalling literature (assessment signals, strategic choice handicaps, direct indicators, revealing handicaps) are explored. It is concluded that two separate but important distinctions have been used to characterize conventional signals (first, whether or not signals allow strategic choice, and, second, whether signalling costs are intrinsic to the signal's production), and that these remain of significance to the understanding of signal design. The paper concentrates mainly on signalling between parties with conflicting evolutionary interests, but briefly shows how these concepts may relate to signalling systems with no conflict of interest.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between crowing and dominance using domestic roosters, Gallus gallus domesticus. Dominant males crowed significantly more often than subordinate males and often attacked subordinates that crowed. Dominants also produced crows that were higher in frequency than subordinates. In addition, dominant males spent more time near the speaker when crows of dominant males were played than they did when crows of subordinate males were played. Neither subordinate males nor females responded to tapes from males of either status. These results suggest that both crow rate and quality vary with male status and that dominants can and do discriminate between males using crow quality as a cue. Growing by roosters could thus potentially function as a signal of status.

AB In nature, two garter snakes (Thamnophis melanogaster and T. eques) feed on the carrion-eating leech Erpobdella punctata but not on the blood-sucking leech Haementeria officinalis. In the laboratory, although ingestively naive snakes attacked both leeches, only E. punctata was successfully ingested. Haementeria officinalis usually thwarted ingestion or killed the snake. In tests with leech odours, ingestively naive T. melanogaster showed significant responsiveness only to E. punctata; but in tests with pieces of integument and live leeches, they responded positively to both leeches, responding more strongly to E. punctata than to H. officinalis. Ingestive and chemosensory responses of litters of T. melanogaster to the two leeches were correlated, implying possible genetic correlation. In a series of 15 trials with live leeches, snakes presented with H. officinalis progressively ceased to attack, whereas snakes presented with E. punctata continued to attack. Snakes that alternately encountered H. officinalis and E. punctata ceased attacking H. officinalis and continued attacking E. punctata. In a subsequent chemosensory test based on tongue-flicking these snakes showed enhanced discrimination of the two leeches, suggesting that snakes can learn to reject H. officinalis, a dangerous and probably unprofitable prey, using chemical cues.

AB This study examines how an ant colony's foraging range changes as the colony grows older, and whether colonies preserve their foraging ranges from year to year. Foraging ranges were measured in 88 colonies of known age over the course of 5 years. A seed-eating ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, colony lives for 15-20 years, reaching a stable size of about 12 000 workers when it is about 5 years old. On average, foraging ranges of colonies 2 years and older were similar in size, so a colony with about 2000 workers uses as much area to forage as one with 12 000. A colony's foraging range increased most from ages 1 to 2 years, when the colony is still very small; increase of foraging area appears to be related to colony growth rather than overall colony size. From year to year, colonies did not retain or expand from a core foraging range. Instead, only about half the foraging range a colony used one summer was used by it the previous summer. However, the overlap of foraging ranges from year to year was significantly greater than expected if foraging ranges were distributed each year at random. The extent of year-to-year turnover in foraging range did not depend on colony age. Most colonies in which reproductives were observed were 5 years or older. These results are considered in the light of previous work showing that 3-4-year-old colonies, at about 75% of mature size, are more persistent in conflict with neighbours over foraging space than older, larger colonies. Effects of colony size on the rate of encounter with neighbours, and the costs of reproduction, may determine developmental changes in the territorial behaviour of an ant colony.

DT Article
ID MATING SYSTEM; YOUNG; INVESTMENT; BEHAVIOR; FISH
AB In fish, the predominant form of parental care is brood defence. The convict cichlid, a biparental fish native to Central America, also engages in two types of brood provisioning: fin digging and leaf lifting. These behaviour patterns were studied in the field, and in outdoor experimental ponds and laboratory aquaria. In the ponds, females fin dug 51 times more often when guarding fry than when unmated; males fin dug three times more frequently when guarding fry than when unmated. After the young became free-swimming, females performed four times (held) and two times (pond and laboratory) more fin digging and twice as many leaf lifts (held) as males. Females in the field increased leaf lifting with brood age but males did not. Fin digging frequency by parental females and males increased with brood age. Frequency of adult feeding bites at the substrate did not change with brood age except in the held, where female feeding bites increased with brood age. In the held, females performed more feeding bites than males but in the laboratory males fed more often than females. Thus changes in fin digging frequency with brood age do not seem to be strongly linked to the feeding requirements of the parents. In the laboratory, fin digging frequency was influenced by substrate quality (P=0.08) but not by ration (P>0.10). Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that parental fin digging and leaf lifting help increase food availability to their young.

AB The brown breast patch of the male grey partridge, the species' most conspicuous sexually dimorphic trait, was totally or partly bleached out, to test its influence on female preference. In mate-choice experiments, patch size (which was unaffected by early testosterone treatment) appeared to be unimportant: artificially and naturally bred females primarily selected males on the basis of their vocal performance. High rates of rusty-gate calls and certain features of their acoustic structure, usually undervalued in studies on non-oscine birds, were the main determinants of male success, with the morphological traits being of lesser importance.

AB Costs and benefits of play were investigated by observing cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, cubs in the wild. Cubs played either after resting or nursing, or while the family was moving; cubs were never injured during 2600 h of observation, and did not become separated from their mother during play; and mothers showed few signs of unease while cubs played. It is argued that energetic and indirect costs of play were insubstantial.;Taking all these potential costs together, overall costs of play appeared low. Very young cubs showed high rates of locomotor play suggesting that play may have immediate rather than delayed benefits, possibly aiding cubs in escaping predation. Components of non-contact social play may be functionally or causally related to approaching prey, whereas components of object and contact play may be related to contacting prey. Litter-mates that stalked and crouched at other family members more frequently during play also stalked and crouched at prey more often, and those showing more frequent object play and contact social play showed higher rates of contacting live prey released for them by their mothers. Distances that cubs chased each other and their success in catching each other during play chases increased with age but the ability of cubs to remain concealed during play stalks and crouches did not improve, implying that only certain aspects of play might be suitable for rehearsing predatory skills.

AB When hoarding food within a circular arena, golden hamsters, Mesocricetus auratus W., return along a direct path from the feeding place at the centre to their nest at the periphery. The homing direction depends on dead reckoning (updated internal signals derived from locomotion) and, if available, on landmarks outside the arena. This study was aimed at defining the conditions under which a landmark panorama predominates over dead reckoning during conflict situations. In agreement with previous results, this was found to be the case only when the panorama contained at least one prominent vertical feature aligned with the apex of a two-dimensional, continuous background pattern. The minimal landscape that controlled homing was a solid cylinder presented in front of the background pattern, or its two-dimensional projection on the pattern itself. Contrary to a previous hypothesis, depth did not appear to be a critical factor in an effective landmark panorama.

AB A variety of animals periodically shuttle between two sites, such as one containing food and another containing oxygen, water, or conditions for heat exchange. The amount of a non-food resource obtained, together with its rate of use, influences travelling and foraging time. Three criteria are evaluated to examine how control of body temperature may be optimal with shuttling: (1) maximizing proportion of time foraging, (2) maximizing rate of net energy gain for a shuttle cycle and (3) maximizing time travelling and foraging relative to time spent at a heat-exchange site. Detailed information on heat exchange by desert antelope ground squirrels, Ammospermophilus leucurus, cooling in their burrows and heating while travelling and foraging on the hot desert surface is used to calculate body temperatures that maximize each criterion. Results also are discussed for analogous models for intermittent bird incubation and ectotherm basking. The third criterion is rejected based on published body temperature patterns. The other criteria are plausible but assume temperature control in anticipation of environmental conditions. Body temperatures that maximize the first criterion maximize rates of net energy gain when the rate of gross energy gain is constant. The optimal body temperatures of ground squirrels exiting a burrow should decrease with: (1) increasing travel time, (2) higher heating or cooling rates, (3) decreased body temperature upon return to a burrow and (4) higher rates of gross energy gain.

AB Vigilance behaviour was examined in four groups of white-faced capuchins in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Pica. In each group, males spent more time vigilant than females. Average time spent vigilant within each group was not significantly correlated with group size, but was negatively correlated with the number of male group members. The alpha male tended to be the most vigilant individual in each group. Males in two of the four groups were more vigilant at waterholes than in other areas; males in two of the three groups having overlapping ranges were more vigilant in areas of overlap. There was a positive correlation between absence of neighbours and level of vigilance in both sexes. Male vigilance appeared to be directed primarily towards males in other groups, rather than towards potential predators or other group members.

AB The activity of seven lactating, ice-breeding grey seal females was quantified using time-depth recorders. The females spent an average of 72.2 +/- 21.7 (SD)% of their time on the ice, 20.1 +/- 16.7% in the water at the surface, and 7.6 +/- 5.8% diving. A total of 2252 dives were recorded with a mean dive duration of 110 +/- 82 s. The maximum recorded dive duration was 9 min 10 s. The females hauled out significantly more during dark hours (1900-0700 hours) than during light hours (0700-1900 hours). A significant negative correlation was found between increasing wind-chill index and decreasing numbers of females hauled out. The duration of haul-out periods and the intervals between them suggest that the pups nursed every 2-3 h. Average daily mass loss by mothers was 5.7 +/- 0.4 kg. Average daily mass gain by pups was 2.4 +/- 0.5 kg. The mean mass transfer efficiency was 0.44 +/- 0.08. No correlation was found between maternal mass loss and pup mass gain among pairs or between mass loss or mass transfer rates and time spent in different activities by females. The lack of correlations between these variables, in addition to the dominant dive profile (where most of the dive time by the females was spent at the bottom), suggests that some ice-breeding grey seal females feed during lactation.

AB Behavioural analyses often require documentation of spatial overlap of individuals or groups. Most often these data have been presented as unweighted overlaps, calculated as the percentage of home range area that is shared between neighbours. This metric does not take into consideration the frequency of use of space in the area of overlap, which often is less than in the core of a home range. A method for calculating asymmetrical weighted overlap values between neighbouring individuals or groups is described using a program written for SAS. This method yields a null expectation of the likelihood of interaction between neighbours, by taking into consideration their respective frequency of use of space in the area of overlap. A. comparative analysis of a sample data set is presented using both unweighted and weighted overlap values. The results indicate that the two methods would generate different null expectations of the frequency of social interactions. The asymmetrical weighted overlap method is a valuable approach for the characterization of the texture of space use by animals and the generation of expectations for interaction frequency between neighbours.

ID DIFFERENTIATION; PRIMATES
AB Aggressive interactions were observed in two primate species: rhesus monkeys, which have a female-bonded social system, and hamadryas baboons, which have a non-female-bonded social system. Dyadic and triadic aggression and assertiveness were examined under controlled ecological conditions and demographic structure, focusing on interactions initiated by adult females between and within two groups of each species. The literature suggests that rhesus monkeys interact with a broad class of partners while hamadryas baboons have limited social interactions. Primates have flexible social systems, however, and differences are probably not due to species specificity. Rhesus females used dyadic interactions more frequently in conflict situations while hamadryas females often involved a third individual. Aggression was directed within more than between groups in both species; hamadryas females sometimes targeted females in other groups, however. The results suggest that interactions initiated by hamadryas females may be overlooked as they use more subtle and complex behaviour than do rhesus females. This difference is discussed in relation to the social system.

AB Two remarkably similar theories predict how animals will distribute themselves between foraging sites. The ideal free distribution predicts that, in continuous input situations, the equilibrium ratio of animals between sites will match the food input ratio. A psychological model, the matching law, predicts that the equilibrium allocation of the behaviour of individual animals will match their obtained reinforcer rates. An aviary experiment with a flock of six house sparrows, Passer domesticus, was conducted to test these ideas. Five different food input ratios were used. The behavioural allocation of the flock substantially undermatched the food input ratio. Individual food intake rates were not the same at each site. The behavioural allocation of individual birds also significantly undermatched their individual reinforcer rates. When the behavioural allocation of individual birds was plotted as a function of the overall reinforcer rates, the slopes were positively correlated with the birds' dominance ranks. In situations where there are competitive asymmetries Parker and Sutherland (1986, Anim, Behav., 34, 1222-1242) have suggested that the sum of the competitive abilities of the foragers in a patch should match the food input ratio. However, the sum of competitive abilities in a patch again undermatched the food input ratio. As the individual birds also undermatched, it is suggested that perceptual constraints may explain some of the observed departures from the predictions of Parker and Sutherland. Despite high levels of agonistic interactions the flock behaved as a relatively cohesive unit. This exacerbated the costs of these interactions and may have also contributed to the substantial undermatching observed. The importance of social constraints on flock foraging animals is stressed.

AB Observations of an expanding population of brown jays in Monteverde, Costa Rica made it possible to characterize a transition from incomplete habitat saturation, in which jays maintained moderate group sizes, to more complete habitat saturation, in which jays maintained larger group sizes and showed increased aggression at high densities. From 1977 to 1990, the number of individuals, number of flocks, and mean flock size on the study area increased dramatically. Only at high densities did flocks comprised of fewer than six individuals attempt breeding, even though suitable habitat (indicated by later successful breeding there), had been available for the past decade. The population has expanded its local range as well, and now occupies all of the preferred cleared habitat in the study area. Coincident with these demographic changes, the emergence of overt intra-group aggression at the nest was observed, especially that involving interference competition between rival older females during the building/laying stage of the nesting cycle. Aggressive interactions at a nest were much more likely in flocks with more than 10 individuals and also more likely as the number of birds seen sitting on the nest increased. The positive relationship between number of offspring produced and the number of old birds in a flock was weakened at higher densities, probably resulting from increased intra-group aggression. These observations suggest that high population density and limited breeding opportunities resulted in increased reproductive competition. Sociality, however, has not simply been forced in this population, because even at low densities in the presence of ample unused habitat Monteverde brown jays bred only in groups. This suggests that intrinsic benefits to group living probably have also played an important part in maintaining sociality in this population.

AB Parental investiment ''decisions'' should consider the value of the current blood relative to the parents'' own survival and subsequent reproduction. The influence of blood size and past investment in the existing blood was measured in the convict cichlid, Cichlasmona nigrofasciatum. Brood size and past investment were manipulated by reducing and augmenting brood size early and late in the brood cycle. Both factors influence current parental investment; brood size appears to be relatively more  important when the brood is agumented, and past investment is more important when the brood is reduced. Females consistently invested more than males.

DT Review
ID OXYTRICHA-BIFARIA CILIATA; STOKES CILIATA; HYPOTRICHIDA; ETHOGRAM
AB This paper reviews the literature on the behaviour of ciliated protozoa, described the locomotion of five species and examines studies of its causation, development, function and evolution. The significance of the very small size of ciliates and their unicellularity for the motor patterns is discussed. Several elements are involved in the causation of ciliate behaviour: depolarization of the membrane potential: adhesion to the substrate; cell size; individual variation; and metabolic state. The development and inheritance of mating behaviour and the adaptive consequences of thigmotaxis are also described. The hypotrichs are shown to have the most sophisticated behaviour and the fastest, most stereotyped locomotion of all the ciliates. The ciliated protozoa are suggested as suitable organisms for behavioural research on basic problems of how animals adapt to their environment.

   MALE MORPHS OF THE DUNG BEETLE ONTHOPHAGUS-BINODIS THUNBERG (COLEOPTERA,
   SCARABAEIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Large, horned males of the dung beetle Onthophagus binodis assisted their mates in gathering larval provisions and guarded their mates'' burrows when vacated. The horned males'' assistance is expected to increase their mates'' reproductive success. In contrast, small, hornless males did not appear to help females during oviposition. Differences in courthsip behaviour between the male morphs indicated that large, horned males may be assessing female size and employing precopulatory male  discrimination. Under laboratory conditions small, hornless males inseminated females on the first encounter more often than large, horned males and presumbly exercise minimal mate discrimination. However, the mating frequencies of the male morphs may be different in the field as a result of either intrasexual selection or female choice. Features of mating in O. binodis were the male''s (1) tactile stimulation of the female, and (2) upwark jerks of the head and pronotum before, during and after copulation. This latter action would facilitate dissemination of pheromones from the exocrine glands on their forelegs.

TI THE ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF NEST DEFENSE BY MERLIN, FALCO-COLUMBARIUS,
   MALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations during the laying period and after hatching showed that nest defence by merlins varied from fierce attacks to virtually no response. During the laying period as well as after hatching, the intensity of defence of paired males and females was inversely related. The frequency of nest desertions was higher among pairs in which the male invested little in nest defence compared with his mate than among other pairs. For females, intensity of nest defence was related to the age of the young and to the numbers of chicks. In contrast, these factors did not influence nest defence by males. The consequence of low investment in nest defence by males was a higher probability of the pair deserting the nest leading either to low fledgling production from replacement clutches or to complete breeding failure.

TI THE FUTURE COMPONENTS OF INCLUSIVE FITNESS - ACCOUNTING FOR INTERACTIONS
   BETWEEN MEMBERS OF OVERLAPPING GENERATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Indirect fitness is the portion of an individual''s inclusive fitness due to the effects of the individual''s behaviour on the reproductive value of non-descedndant kin. Indirect fitness may play a role in the evolutionary maintenance of cooperative breeding, in which some individuals help others to breed. Recently, theoretical and empirical studies have addressed the future component of indirect fitness, i.e., the effects of an individual current behaviour on the subsequent survival and reproduction of non-descendent kin. A difficulty in accounting future fitness effects arises when generations overlap in a cooperative breeding system (as is normally the case). Individuals of one generation can serve as helpers to individuals of the previous generation, ''returning from the future'' to compound their ancestors'' fitness. This paper classifies the types of fitness effects arising from generational interactions in cooperative breeding systems. This classification is then used to suggest methods of measuring future indirect and future direct (individual) fitness so tha they are directly comparable.

TI FEEDING NEOPHOBIA AND ECOLOGICAL PLASTICITY - A TEST OF THE HYPOTHESIS
   WITH CAPTIVE SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The hypothesis that quantitative differences in neophobia underlie variation in ecological plasticity was tested by comparing feeding responses of wild-caught immature song, Melospiza melodia, and swamp, M. georgiana, sparrows in captivity. The song sparrow is a habitat generalist and good colonizing species, while the swamp sparrow specializes on marsh habitats. As predicted by the neophobia hypothesis, captive swamp sparrows showed a greater hesitancy to feed in the presence of a variety of novel objects than did song sparrows. Swamp sparrows made significantly more approaches to the food source without feeding when a novel object was present. There was a consistent difference in latency among individuals within each species. Habituation reduced latencies in the most neophobic sparrows, but sometimes almost a week of constant exposure was required before swamp sparrows fed without hesitation.

TI THE EVOLUTION OF FATAL FIGHTING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The evolution of fatal fighting was investigated using evolutionary game theory. General considerations about the lifetime consequences of fighting behaviour are first discussed. A sequential assessment game is then developed in which a fight can end because a contestant either gives up or is killed. The results show that the balance between the value of the contested resource and the value of the future is one important factor influencing the frequency of death or severe injury in fights. When  the value of a contested resource is similar to or greater than the value of the future, strategies will evolve that result in contestants being severely injured or killed during fights. When the value of the future is close to zero contestants will never give up after starting to fight; such fights will always be fatal for at least one of the opponents. Factors that could decrease the cost of fighting, such as the assessment of fighting ability, kinship and role asymmetries, have little or no  effect in these situations. Finally, empirical data on fatal fighting are reviewed and compared with theoretical predictions. Data show that dangerous fighting, often resulting in severe injuries or death, generally occurs in situations where a major part of a contestant''s lifetime reproductive success is at stake.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus, show a first-male advantage in sperm competition under field conditions. The hypothesis that this advantage is related to the delay between male matings was tested in a laboratory experiment using individuals of known allozyme genotype. The interval between first and second male matings was varied across a range extending from 0.38 to 3.83 h; observational data on male copulatory behaviour were also examined for the effects of  copulation duration on fertilization success. The results indicated that paternity in this standardized situation was best predicted by a combination of two variables: the delay between the males'' matings, and the duration of the longest copulation achieved by the second male.

TI PAIRING AND SPAWNING PATTERNS IN THE COMMON TOAD, BUFO-BUFO - THE
   EFFECTS OF SEX-RATIOS AND THE TIME AVAILABLE FOR MALE MALE COMPETITION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The time available for male-male competition and the sex ratios of common toads were manipulated within enclosures in a natural pond. At an even sex ratio, pairs formed at random with respect to body length of pair members. Pairs were still randomly composed at spawning. By contrast, when sex ratios were experimentally male-biased (2:1), after 3 days of male-male competition large males were over-represented in spawning pairs. When the time available for competition was longer (10 days), pairs  were size-assorted. The probability of taking over a female in amplexus and resisting displacement attempts when in amplexus was a function not only of male size but also of the relative sizes of the pair members. Small males in amplexus with large females were easily displaced, as were large males coupled with small females. Pairs where the male and the female were matched in size had a higher probability of staying in amplexus than those less closely matched. Males did not discriminate  between females of different sizes. These findings are in line with a hypothesis that non-random spawning patterns in the common toad are generated primarily by male-male competition. Mate choice (male or female) does not have to be invoked to explain non-random spawning patterns in this species.

TI FUNCTION OF SONG IN SCOTTS SEASIDE SPARROW,
   AMMODRAMUS-MARITIMUS-PENINSULAE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The function of song in a Florida [USA] population of Scott''s seaside sparrows was experimentally investigated during the breeding seasons of 1983-1984 by temporarily muting male birds in the field. Birds were muted by rupturing the interclavicular air sac. They remained songless for about 2 weeks but could give all of their normal calls during this time. Two rounds of mutings were administered, each preceded and followed by time budget, playback and other observations on three treatment  groups: muted, sham-operated and undisturbed birds. The early muting round tested for mate and territory acquisition. These muted birds remained mateless until they regained their voices; most attracted a female after voice recovery. The early muted birds also acquired territories later than sham-operated and undisturbed birds. The mid-season muting round tested for mate and territory retention, and for changes in behaviour. All muted birds lost their mates; a few attracted new mates when they regained singing ability. Their territories either shrank or were lost, but new territories were established (or the original re-expanded) after voice recovery. The intensity of most close-range aggressive behaviour was significantly greater for muted birds than for sham-operated and undisturbed birds. There were no discernible differences between sham-operated and undisturbed birds for any attributes measured.

TI PATCH CHOICE AND MEAL SIZE OF FORAGING RATS AS A FUNCTION OF THE
   PROFITABILITY OF FOOD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rats lived in a laboratory environment that simulated foraging costs with bar-pressing requirements. The rats encountered sequential opportunities to eat meals in two food patches that differed in the size and/or price of food pellets. The rats accepted more opportunities and ate larger meals in the patch offering the more-profitable food, whether the larger or the lower-priced pellets. Despite widely varying patterns of intake between the patches, total daily intake was constant across most conditions. The extent to which the less-profitable food was included in the diet was a function of the size of the profitability difference. Profitability at each patch was calculated both as g earned per bar press and as g earned per min during meals. These two measures were correlated, but relative g/min was a better predictor of the relative feeding patterns. The results were not in accord  with a simple, effort-minimization model of optimal foraging, although they were compatible with the notion that the cost of suboptimal behaviour will influence its occurrence.

TI DOMINANCE AND SOCIAL FORAGING - A LABORATORY STUDY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Analysis of an asymmetric two-player game, in which a dominant forager and a subordinate individual each choose between two patches of food, suggested conditions that might induce solitary or social foraging. To investigate the game''s predictive value, pairs of juncos, Junco hyemalis, were exposed to particular combinations of food density and dispersion in an aviary. Estimated feeding rates were taken as payoffs in the patch-use game. Solutions to the game indicated reasonable interpretations of (1) the transition rates between various states of the system, (2) the amounts of time spent feeding socially and as solitaries,(3) the transition probabilities estimated from the observed sequence of states, and (4) the number of occurrences of each state. Subordinate birds terminated bouts of social foraging significantly more often than dominant birds, but subordinates did so at a slower rate when the game suggested stability for social foraging. Dominant birds followed subordinates and initiated significantly more than half of the bouts of social foraging. In general, the statistical pattern in the sequence of states did not change with variation in the density or degree of clumping of the food, but the amount of time spent feeding in the social states did depend on food availability and feeding rates.

TI SUNFISH FORAGING AMONG PATCHES - THE PATCH-DEPARTURE DECISION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Patch-use behaviour of small bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, foraging for chironomid larvae, Chironomus riparius, was investigated in artificial macrophyte patches to examine search pattern within a patch and to determine the decision rule used by fish when leaving a patch. Fish were exposed to a sequence of habitats which differed in quality (i.e. total prey density); however, within a habitat all patches were of equal quality. When foraging in a single patch, fish encountered prey  randomly, as evidenced by agreement between the distribution of intercapture intervals and the exponential distribution. Agreement between fish behaviour and predictions of a rate decision rule indicated that the decision to leave a patch was based on some estimate of capture rate in the patch. Predictions of how long fish should stay in a patch and how many prey they should capture during a patch visit were generated, using a giving-up time model based on an exponential distribution of  intercapture intervals. Fish generally stayed longer and captured more prey than predicted by the model, using giving-up times that were longer than optimal. The relationship between rate of prey capture for the habitat and giving-up times was shaped such that fish mimimized the cost, in terms of a decrease in capture rate, by overestimating rather than underestimating the optimal giving-up time.

TI MATING TACTICS OF MALE ROCK PTARMIGAN, LAGOPUS-MUTUS - A CONDITIONAL
   MATING STRATEGY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The mating tactics adopted by individual male rock ptarmigan, Lagopus mutus, during the receptive (egg-laying) and post-receptive (incubation) period of their mates were compared. The tactic employed by a male depended upon the reproductive condition of his mate. Throughout his mate''s receptive period, a male remained on his territory and closely guarded his mate. However, once his mate began incubating, a male frequently left his territory to seek copulations with females that were still  receptive. The asynchronous nesting pattern of females, resulting from heavy nest predation, permitted the expression of a mixed male strategy in this non-colonial species.

TI FEMALE CHOICE AND MALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN THE ANGEL BLENNY,
   CORALLIOZETUS-ANGELICA (TELEOSTEI, CHAENOPSIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Correlates of reproductive success of male Coralliozetus angelica were studied in field populations in the central gulf of California [Mexico] by collecting males with their shelters (vacant barnacle tests) and counting the number of eggs defended. Male body size was positively correlated with the number of eggs defended. This apparently resulted from female preference for large males since females preferred to mate with the larger of two males in laboratory choice experiments. Condition of males, as assessed by their relative head width, was also positively correlated with the number of eggs defended. Fit of males in their shelter entrance, male colour intensity, and male size relative to immediately surrounding males were not correlated with reproductive success. The quality of shelters was an important determinant of male reproductive success since females apparently avoided mating with males in heavily fouled shelters. Large shelters tended to be more heavily fouled than small  shelters and male size and shelter size were positively correlated. The resulting negative correlation of male size and shelter quality apparently constrained female preference for large males and may be an important factor limiting the degree of polygyny in this species.

TI THE IDEAL FREE DISTRIBUTION WHEN COMPETITIVE ABILITIES DIFFER - AN
   APPROACH BASED ON STATISTICAL-MECHANICS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Suppose that two patches are available to a group of competing animals. Fretwell and Lucas (1970) considered how the animals should distribute themselves between these patches, and derived the Ideal Free Distribution. Sutherland and Parker (1985) extended the model of Fretwell and Lucas to include the case where animals differ in their competitive abilities. They showed that there are usually several ways in which an Ideal Free Distribution can be realized, and introduced the notion of  the most probable realization. This paper gives a general analysis of the extended model of Sutherland and Parker. The most probable distribution of animals when the number of competing animals is large is derived. For this distribution the proportion of animals of a given competitive ability that are present on the more profitable patch increases with competitive ability. This has the consequence that the proportion of all animals on the more profitable patch is less than the proportion of all rewards that are delivered by this patch.

TI EFFECTS OF AGE AND SEX ON INTRA-GROUP SPACING BEHAVIOR IN JUVENILE
   SAVANNAH BABOONS, PAPIO-CYNOCEPHALUS-CYNOCEPHALUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Twenty juvenile members of known genealogies in two baboon groups were studied over a 16-month period to evaluate a number of predictions about juvenile spacing behaviour based on the natural history of savannah baboons. Young juveniles (1-2.5 years old) approached more frequently and spent more time in proximity to other group members than did old juveniles (3-5.5 years old). In particular, young juveniles associated more closely with their mothers, particular adult males (possible fathers)  and age-peers than did old juveniles. Approaches of young juveniles towards unrelated, high-ranking adults were more likely to occur during feeding than were those of old juveniles. Also, following such an approach, young juveniles were more likely than old juveniles to begin feeding immediately. The overall rates of feeding of old juveniles were depressed when they were in proximity to unrelated, high-ranking adults, whereas the feeding rates of young juveniles were not. Juvenile males  approached adult males more often than did juvenile females. Juvenile females approached unrelated adult females more often than did juvenile males. Sex differences also existed in juveniles'' choices of unrelated adult female neighbours. Juvenile females associated more often with lactating females, whereas juvenile males associated primarily with cycling females. During group resting, juvenile females approached adult females from higher-ranking matrilines more often than they approached adult  females from lower-ranking matrilines. Juvenile males did not exhibit this attraction. Also, among old juveniles, females associated closely with their mothers, whereas males did not. Taken together, the results support the hypotheses that juvenile baboons associate with group members in ways that (1) enhance the probability of surviving an early period of high mortality, (2) create opportunities for social learning of sex-typical behaviours/skills, and, for females, (3) facilitate acquisition  of familial dominance status.

AB Eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, graze in open-membership groups and are hunted by dingoes, Canis familiaris dingo. Kangaroos in groups of different sizes were simultaneously observed on a homogeneous pasture and their activities were recorded. All major environmental variables, except group size, were the same for all individuals. There was a strong positive correlation between group size and time spent feeding and a negative one with time spent looking around, the relationship  being best described by asymptotic curves. Kangaroos in small groups were significantly more likely than those in large groups to stand upright when looking around, a posture interpreted as indicating more intense alertness.

TI EXTRA-PAIR COPULATIONS IN A PREDOMINANTLY MONOGAMOUS BIRD - OBSERVATIONS
   OF BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The mating behaviour of indigo buntings, Passerina cyanea was studied. A total of 535 attempted matings in 3 years were observed. Of the 413 copulations that occurred within the females''s presumed fertile period (from 12 days before to the day before the last egg was laid), 53 (12.8%) were extrapair copulations (EPCs). The rate of within-pair copulations (WPCs) per pair-hour, EPCs per female-hour and territorial intrusions per h all peaked 3 days before the first egg was laid. Intruders were  attracted to copulations, and males attempted to copulate with their mates more after an intrusion. Nearly all intruders and males attempting EPCs were territorial neighbours. More than half of the males attempting EPCs had one or more females nesting on their territories. Although males behaved as if they were guarding their mates from possible EPCs, they often left their females unguarded. Females resisted EPCs significantly more than WPCs, and attempted EPCs were less likely to make cloacal contact than attempted WPCs. However, some forced EPCs did make cloacal contact. The difficulties of estimating the rate of extra-pair fertilizations from observations of copulations are discussed. Finally, in the light of these results the possible role of nesting density, mate guarding, synchrony of breeding, male parental care and polygyny on the rate of EPCs is examined.

AB It is current orthodoxy in biological game theory that in animal contests with easily recognized asymmetries between the contestants, an asymmetry will be used to settle the dispute. Here it is argued that, if the winning of contests plays a major in gaining reproductive success, an individual will not be selected to respect an asymmetry which place it always in the losing role. Asymmetries that create consistent losers of this sort are termed divisive asymmetries. Divisive asymmetries cannot be used to settle important contests in an evolutionarily stable way because the consistent losers will have no incentive to respect them.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF HABITAT AND GROUP CHARACTERISTICS ON THE ALARM AND
   FLIGHT RESPONSE OF WHITE-TAILED DEER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The alarm and flight response of white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, to a human observer was studied on Ossabaw Island, Georgia [USA]. Deer in forest (cover present) and pasture (no cover) were less likely to flee as distance from the observer increased. This decline with distance was more pronounced in the pasture. Larger groups (three or more deer) in the forest were more likely to flee than smaller groups. Most groups flagged when fleeing, though flagging was less common in the pasture than in the forest. Snorting was more common in larger groups, but apparently was not related to group composition. The data support the following hypotheses. (1) Deer in dense vegetation flee even when a predator is at a considerable distance, because of the danger of losing sight of the predator. (2) Larger groups are more likely to spot a predator than are smaller groups and are thus more likely to flee. (3) Flagging is a low cost alarm signal to other deer which benefits the  individual by increasing the number of deer fleeing with it. (4) Snorting has evolved through individual selection as a signal to the predator that it has been detected.

TI THE ONTOGENY OF THE PECKING RESPONSE OF LAUGHING GULL CHICKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Hailman reported that wild-reared laughing gull, Larus atricilla, chicks peck preferentially at models of laughing gulls over models of herring gulls, L. argentatus, but newly hatched chicks have no species preference, and respond equally well to an isolated red bill. The experiments reported here confirm these observations. They also suggest that the pecking of newly hatched chicks is guided by heterogeneous summation A new working definition of heterogeneous summation is presented. Furthermore, the results suggest that species preference does not develop spontaneously with maturation or on the basis of imprinting, but rather from reinforcement and conditioned inhibition or habituation. It appears that learning can take place only to a model with high releasing value for pecking, and that the crooning call of adult laughing gulls has no major effect on pecking in newly hatched chicks.

Call duration, the number and rate of calls in a sequence, and absolute intensity (dB) significantly affected chitter vocalization responses. These parameters correlate functionally with the characteristics of actual calls given by adults within the colony. Call frequency (Hz), frequency modulation, and within-call variations in intensity did not. The latter parameters constitute potential physical bases for further differentiation of responses during subsequent development.

TI COURTSHIP SOUNDS AND BEHAVIOR IN THE 4 SPECIES OF THE
   DROSOPHILA-BIPECTINATA COMPLEX
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The D. bipectinata complex contains four species [D. bipectinata, D. parabipectinata, D. malerkotliana and D. pseudoananassae] which are sympatric over parts of their range. They are morphologically identical and hybridize in no-choice mating situations. They have similar but distinct courtship patterns and males of all species sing two songs, long song early and short song late in courtship. Each species has a unique song profile due to differences in at least one song parameter. This is circumstantial evidence that sounds function to maintain sexual isolation within the complex.

TI INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN THE ISOLATION CALLS OF MEXICAN FREE-TAILED BAT
   PUPS (TADARIDA-BRASILIENSIS MEXICANA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Near-term pregnant females and female-pup nursing pairs of Mexican free-trailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana) were captured from large maternity colonies in central Texas. A total of 337 isolation calls from 20 pups were recorded and nine call parameters were measured from each call either sonagraphically or with a spectrum analyser. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the call parameters show that the calls of different pups are structurally distinct. Discriminant function  analysis using a random subset of calls correctly categorized 60.4% to the pup emitting them. These results suggest that the pups have individual vocal signatures. Calls also possess qualities which suggest that they are attractive in nature and easy to locate. Regression analyses show that several call parameters increase in frequency as pups age.

TI FORAGING TEMPO IN 2 WOODLAND ANT SPECIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Running speeds of Myrmica punctiventris and Aphaenogaster rudis workers were measured, and a good correspondence between laboratory and field behaviour was obtained. In the laboratory, foraging tempo and foraging efficiency were calculated for two colony sizes and five patterns of prey availability. Running speeds were strongly dependent on colony size for both species; when retrieving prey, foragers from large colonies ran significantly faster than those from small colonies. In addition,  ants searching for prey ran more slowly than those returning to the nest with prey. Efficiency, measured as the propensity to return to the nest in a straight line, was most strongly a function of distance from the nest. Finally, no relationship between an ant''s speed and its efficiency of return was found.

TI CONFLICT BETWEEN RED DEER HINDS - THE WINNER ALWAYS WINS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Dominance relations between free-living, female red deer (hinds) (Cervus elaphus L.) on the Isle of Rhum, Scotland [UK], were investigated. Most interactions were won by the older hind of the pair and this was the case even when both individuals had reached full body size. The younger hind was more likely to be the winter if the conflict was escalated or if the two hinds were strangers, in which case escalation was more frequent than usual. When outside their normal home range, older hinds  were much more likely to lose, and younger ones more likely to win, than usual. These results can be best explained by the hinds using previous experience as a cue for conventional resolution of conflict, with the result that dominance relationships established early in life are perpetuated. No such cue is available if the hinds have not previously met.

TI THE ROLE OF MALE SONG IN SEX RECOGNITION IN ZAPRIONUS-TUBERCULATUS
   (DIPTERA, DROSOPHILIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations of ''type-1'' male courtship song of Zaprionus tuberculatus are described. The song is a frequent, but not obligatory, component of successful courtships. It is also typically produced in intermale courtships, in which males that are being courted produce, on average, approximately twice as much type-1 song as the courting males. Males that have their wings amputated, and thus cannot produce song, mount each other significantly more often than do intact males. It is hypothesized  that one of the functions of type-1 song is to provide a cue for sex recognition, since sexual dimorphism in this species is slight. In competition for a deafened female, intact males show no clear advantage over wingless males. Thus, there is no evidence that type-1 song has a role in inter-male competition. Its role in heterosexual courtships remains unclear.

TI BEHAVIORAL ALLOMETRY AND INTERDEMIC VARIATION IN SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR OF THE
   SAILFIN MOLLY, POECILIA-LATIPINNA (PISCES, POECILIIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sailfin mollies, Poecilia latipinna, exhibit remarkable levels of intraspecific variation in reproductive behaviour. Larger males exhibit higher rates of courtship and lowered rates of gonoporal nibbling and gonopodial thrusting (forced copulation attempts). Larger males have relatively longer and higher dorsal fins than smaller males. The dorsal fin is a prominent component of the courtship display. Variation in fin measurements, behaviour patterns, and body size of mature males is continuous, and fin shape and behaviour patterns are allometrically related to body size. The allometric pattern is displayed by individual traits as well as by the morphological or behavioural traits in ensemble. Eight populations of mollies from markedly distinct habitats exhibited similar consistent levels of intrademic variation in the size of mature males. Detailed studies on three populations showed that dorsal fin shape could be described by the same regression relationship in all  populations, and indicated that a male''s shape was determined by his absolute body size. By contrast, there was some variation among populations in the relation of behaviour patterns to male body size. The pattern of this interdemic variation indicated that a male''s behaviour patterns were influenced by his relative size in a population. Successful inseminations following forced copulations were rare. The average size of successful males was smaller than the average size of unsuccessful males in all three populations. These results indicated that successful insemination through forced copulation was, like behaviour patterns generally, more a function of the relative size of the male, than his absolute size.

TI THE VIBRATION DANCE OF THE HONEY-BEE .2. THE EFFECTS OF FORAGING SUCCESS
   ON DAILY PATTERNS OF VIBRATION ACTIVITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Using a series of experiments that manipulated the ability of colonies to collect food, we investigated the possibility that daily patterns of vibration dance activity were dependent upon foraging success. We found that large peaks of vibration dance activity occurring early in the morning were induced if a colony experienced 3-4 days of successful foraging. In contrast, smaller vibration peaks occurring later in the day were found to be immediate responses (occurring within 30 min) to  increased foraging activity. There was no indication that peaks of vibration activity were influenced by weather. The vibration dance therefore appeared to be sensitive to foraging success on both a long- and short-term basis. Since previous research suggested that the vibration dance also regulates foraging on two time scales, the dance may operate as a two-level feedback system which allows colonies to adjust foraging activity to both long- and short-term fluctuations in food availability.

TI WHY LOCUSTS START TO FEED - A COMPARISON OF CAUSAL FACTORS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB New statistical methods have allowed a quantitative comparison of a number of causal factors affecting feeding in fifth-instar nymphs of the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria). The methods allow one to measure the way the probability of feeding changes with time since the last meal, and how it is affected by previous meal-size, light, food-stimuli, recent defaecation and a short-term rhythm. Since all these factors are measured on the same scale (the extent to which they multiply the  probability of feeding) their relative importance can be assessed. Such measures can then be related to the known physiology that underlies the initiation of feeding. For example, the effect of recent defaecation was unexpectedly large, increasing the probability of feeding seven-fold. It is likely that the size of this effect is due to a sudden change in firing rate of the stretch receptors which monitor the shape and fullness of the hindgut.

LA English
DT Article
AB When an unpaired male red-spotted newt encounters a male and female engaged in amplexus courtship, he attempts to displace the amplectant male, or ''owner'', by wrestling with him. In this study, it was found that the amount of time an intruding male invests in wrestling is determined by both the size of the female, which seems to be a reliable indicator of her fecundity, and the length of the intruder relative to the owner. In 90% of all wrestling encounters observed, the owner retained the  female. Successful displacement was rare and occurred only in encounters in which the intruder was at least as long at the owner. Similar contest behaviour in other amphibians is briefly discussed.

TI SECONDARY IMPRINTING IN THE DOMESTIC CHICK BLOCKED BY PREVIOUS EXPOSURE
   TO A LIVE HEN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two experiments were carried out to investigate secondary imprinting in the domestic chick, G. gallus. Experiment 1 established that, after chicks with very limited prior visual experience had been exposed to a moving cup during the first 3 days of life, the cup when stationary would suppress distress calling. The main experiment, experiment 2, then examined the effects of various forms of prior experience on the development of this kind of imprinting. Three groups of chicks were exposed on days 1 and 2 to either a live hen (hen group), a moving object (windmill group) or the same object when stationary (control group). On days 4,5 and 6 all subjects were given training of the kind used in experiment 1; imprinting to the cup was obtained in the windmill and control groups, but not in the hen group. On days 11 and 12 retention tests were given; these showed good retention of primary imprinting, in that the cup was still effective in suppressing distress calling in the control group and likewise the windmill in the windmill group, but no effect of secondary imprinting was detected, in that the cup no longer affected the behavior of the chicks in the windmill group. These results indicated that primary imprinting with certain stimuli, as in the hen group, can subsequently exert powerful interference with secondary imprinting and they supported a previous claim that, where secondary imprinting does occur, it is relatively unstable.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Bowerbirds build large bowers of twigs decorated with brightly colored objects at display sites where males court females. The bower and its decorations are hypothesized to influence female choice in these birds. There have been no empirical tests of this hypothesis. Data from 2 yr of field research on the satin bowerbird (P. violaceus) show: an extremely skewed distribution of matings among males and a consistent pattern of female preference for particular males, especially those with well-constructed, highly-decorated bowers. Bower quality is apparently important in influencing female mating preferences. The marker hypothesis, which suggests that the construction of bowers evolved to provide females with information about the relative quality of males is supported.

TI THE TIMING OF DECISIONS DURING SHELL INVESTIGATION BY THE HERMIT CRAB,
   PAGURUS-BERNHARDUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Factors which influence decisions by hermit crabs concerning whether to approach, investigate and enter another shell were investigated by systematically varying the size of the shell in possession and the size of the shell being offered. The probability that a crab will approach or enter the shell depends on both variables. Investigation after contact, however, depends only on the size of the shell in possession. Durations of each stage of the sequence are negatively correlated with the numbers of crabs in each experimental group performing the next stage. For the final sequence of aperture investigatory activities, the fewer crabs entering the offered shell, the greater the number of investigatory acts performed by those crabs. In addition to variation in number of acts and duration of investigation, specific use of appendages varies according to the experimental situation. Thus, naked crabs use the minor cheliped to investigate shells in preference to the major cheliped, which is normally used by housed crabs, with the major cheliped being reserved for defence by naked crabs. These data are discussed in terms of information collection and decisions made on the basis of that information.

AB The migratory orientation of European robins (Erithacus rubecula)in autumn was tested immediately after sunset and also after the beginning of astronomical darkness. In twilight tests under clear skies, the birds selected an appropriate migratory direction. During the course of autumn, along with the shifts of sunset azimuth, the orientation of birds also shifted, always in a counter-clockwise direction. Although this shift or orientation was not statistically significant, the difference between the mean direction and the sunset was the same for each autumn period. The migratory direction was selected on the basis of menotactic orientation re the setting sun. Random directions were observed under solid overcast skies as well as during tests under starry skies, begun after all trace of the sunset position had disappeared.

TI THE FUNCTION OF THE VARIATION IN THE BREAST STRIPE OF THE GREAT TIT
   (PARUS-MAJOR)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many winter flocking bird species possess a plumage color polymorphism. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of this variability in plumage structure: the signaling of individual identity (IRH) or social status (SSH). These 2 hypotheses were tested on winter flocking great tits, a species showing intraspecific variation in its breast stripe plumage. The SSH was considered the most probable, because a close correlation between social status and breast stripe width was found. The SSH was further tested by using dummy great tits bearing breast stripes of different widths. Great tits that possessed a breast stripe wider than that of the dummy approached it aggressively, and those with a narrow behaved submissively. The function of the variation in width of the breast stripe plumage is to proclaim the social status of the individual.

TI SOME EFFECTS OF ENERGY COSTS ON FORAGING STRATEGIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of including energy costs on the optimal strategy for animals exploiting a depleting food resource is considered. In the context of central place foraging this leads to the problem of what load size should be brought back to the central place. Two strategies are discussed: maximize gross rate of energy delivery and maximize net rate of energy delivery. The optimal load size (or optimal patch time) for net maximizers is not always larger than for gross maximizers, as has been claimed.  The difference in optimal load size has the same sign as the difference between metabolic rates of travelling and foraging. The influence of costs has not always been directly incorporated in experimental tests of the theory.

TI HABITAT PREFERENCE IN THE DARK-EYED JUNCO (JUNCO-HYEMALIS) - THE ROLE OF
   PHOTOPERIOD AND DOMINANCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Wild-caught dark-eyed juncos (J. hyemalis), simultaneously presented with projected slides of their winter and summer habitats, demonstrated distinct preferences (in terms of time spent in front of particular slides) consistent with their season of capture and prior laboratory experience. Juncos caught in and kept on winter or summer photoperiods preferred winter and summer habitat slides respectively. A gradual increase in photoperiod up to natural summer conditions induced a switch from winter to summer habitat preference; a decrease in photoperiod induced a range of slide preferences correlated with the junco''s size, a measure of the bird''s dominance rank.

TI VOCAL INTERACTIONS, CALL MATCHING AND TERRITORIALITY IN A SRI LANKAN
   TREEFROG, PHILAUTUS-LEUCORHINUS (RHACOPHORIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The vocal repertoire of P. leucorhinus, a rhacophorid frog, consists of several distinct cell-types, each used in a different social context. Males defend space in choruses by calling and ultimately by fighting off rival males. Vocal interactions between males begin with exchanges of territorial calls followed by multi-note calls. Males frequently match their rival''s preceding call by responding with a multi-note call containing a similar number of notes. Vocal interactions become more escalated as the distance between males decreases but the accuracy of matching is apparently unaffected by distance. Males respond to playbacks of advertisement calls or territorial calls by increasing the frequency of territorial calls and the number of notes in their cells. The level of escalation in vocal interactions is possibly a graded threat, signalling the probability of attack. Vocal matching may be an effective means of directing threat signals at a particular rival and/or it may be a consequence of vocal competition for females.

TI THE ROLE OF STIMULUS SIZE AND COLOR IN THE ELICITATION OF
   TESTOSTERONE-FACILITATED AGGRESSIVE AND SEXUAL-RESPONSES IN THE DOMESTIC
   CHICK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three experiments are described which examine the changes underlying the facilitation by testosterone of pecking and a variety of other responses given by young chicks (G. g. domesticus) to large spheres. These behavior patterns resemble some of those seen during adult attack, courtship and copulation. The facilitation of pecking is shown to be size dependent; both testosterone treated and control chicks peck small spheres. Avoidance of the large sphere is not marked in such control animals  and a 2nd experiment demonstrates that they will approach and peck at a small sphere attached to the side of a large sphere, again without obvious signs of avoidance. A 3rd experiment, in which both the color and size of the objects are varied, demonstrates a series of complex dependencies that vary with the behavior pattern studied. A single factor, perhaps acting at the receptor level, e.g., Hailman''s (1967) 1 pigment-2 filter hypothesis, could not easily explain such findings.

TI STRUCTURE OF GELADA BABOON REPRODUCTIVE UNITS .3. THE MALES RELATIONSHIP
   WITH HIS FEMALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The social relationships between the male gelada baboon (T. gelada) and the females of his reproductive unit are examined. A male does not necessarily interact with all his females, but rather tends to have a single predominant social partner, even though failure to interact with his females is likely to result in his eviction as harem-holder by another male. Analysis of the characteristics of the male''s main partner female reveals that these females tend to be those who lack female relatives with whom to groom. The dominant female can monopolize the male if she wants to, but she usually does so in wild groups only when she has no alternative related female partners available. The male''s interactions with non-partner females tend to be more perfunctory and 1-sided than those with his partner female, with non-partner females showing little interest in interacting with the male. The male''s interactions with his main partner are similar to those that characterize close female-female relationships. In social terms, the male seems to function as an alternative (though less desirable) source of coalitionary support for females who lack female relatives with whom to form long-term alliances. An animal''s behavior is constrained by conflicts of interest between its own social strategies and those of its potential interactees.

TI MATERNAL RESPONSIVENESS DURING PREGNANCY IN THE HAMSTER
   (MESOCRICETUS-AURATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Different groups of pregnant hamsters (M. auratus) were tested twice daily for their maternal behavior. Beginning on Days 1, 6, 12, 13, 14, or 15, the hamsters were presented with either 1 pup placed outside of the nest or 3 pups placed directly into the nest. As a control for the effects of pregnancy, virgin groups were also tested under each condition. The animals were observed for licking, crouching and retrieving of the 1-2 day old pups. Maternal responsiveness develops during the 1-2 days of pregnancy and varied test conditions determine more precisely the level and timing of the increased responsiveness to pups. The data are discussed in terms of the interaction between endogenous factors and test conditions and also in terms of possible hormonal contributions to the onset of maternal behavior.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two hypotheses for the orientation of autumnal migration over the western North Atlantic Ocean, proposed by Williams and Richardson, were tested by simulating the flight of birds from North to South America through calculated wind fields in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Use of a constant compass heading proved to be a tenable strategy for birds departing from the North American coast as far north as Nova Scotia [Canada]. The range of succesful heading, however, became increasingly restricted at northern latitudes. Airspeed, heading, altitude and point of departure all had major effects on migratory success. Time required for successful non-stop migration was between 70 and 100 h for passerines and 40-60 h for shorebirds.

ID GENUS CENOCORIXA HEMIPTERA; EXPERIMENTAL HYBRIDIZATION; SIGARA-STRIATA;
   STRIDULATION
AB Both male and female P. nana stridulate by rubbing fields of pegs on the fore femora over thickened flanges on the maxillary plates. The sound-radiating structure may be the head, which is driven into oscillation when its edges are plucked by rows of femoral pegs. P. nana males produce spontaneous, courtship, mounting and copulatory signals. The latter 2 signals are produced by a new mechanism which constitutes only the 3rd record of inter-individual stridulation in insects. The known acoustic behavior of the female is limited to a signal indicating readiness to mate. Mating behavior was observed and copulatory success found not to rely on a complete exchange of acoustic signals. Corixids capable of singing can probably have either an obligatory or optional exchange of signals.

Bulls which associated with cows behaved quite differently from other bulls. In sparse elephant populations a bull may have a greater chance of associating with an estrous female if he lives permanently with a group of cows (the traditional concept of the herd bull) instead of searching for receptive cows during the mating season.

TI WIND DRIFT, COMPENSATION, AND THE USE OF LANDMARKS BY NOCTURNAL BIRD
   MIGRANTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Fall nocturnal migration was described for 3 localities in eastern New York, USA, 1 adjacent to the Hudson River, the other two 30 km to the west in a topographically more uniform area. Migrants at both study areas moved southwest in winds not out of the west and thus seemed unaffected by the river. In west winds, birds away from the river moved south-southeast; those in the vicinity of the river flew a track west of south paralleling the river. A relative increase in the number of migrants along the river (compared to away from it) was observed in west winds as birds presumably became concentrated near the river. On most autumn nights migrants passing through this area have a preferred track direction toward the southwest and in strong winds from the west and northwest they are drifted. Upon reaching the Hudson River vicinity some birds alter their headings, yielding a track direction that closely parallels the river and at least partially compensates for wind drift. No alternative hypothesis is consistent with all the data.

TI TIMING AND DURATION OF MATE GUARDING IN MAGPIES, PICA-PICA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The duration and temporal pattern of mate guarding in the magpie was determined. In 5 out of 6 pairs, guarding started 4 days before the 1st egg, and in 1 pair, 5 days before the 1st egg; and ended with the laying of the 3rd of 6 eggs. This pattern is consistent with the idea (derived from studies of avian reproductive physiology) that sperm which have been in the female''s reproductive tract for 48 h before ovulation, fertilize most eggs. Guarding may cease from day 3 because the probability of a 2nd male fertilizing any eggs is low, and any eggs fertilized would be late in the sequence and chicks hatching from them less likely to survive. Since incubation starts before the end of laying, opportunities for extra-marital copulation would be reduced.

They find certain colors more attractive, and others less attractive, than the natural unbanded condition. Females prefer red-banded males over unbanded ones, and avoid light-blue and light-green banded males. Males prefer black and pink banded females and avoid those wearing light-blue or light-green bands.These findings may be useful in the study of mate choice in monogamous species; they also raise important questions about a widely used experimental technique.

Stimuli were administered for periods of 1 min and all behavior was recorded. Pumping was associated with tactile contact to the spider''s abdomen. Pumping increased with increasing frequency of phasic stimul delivered to the web surface. Attack increased linearly with the log of stimulus frequencies between 0 and 14 Hz for stimuli delivered to the catching spiral. Dropping occurred only when high frequencies and amplitudes of stimuli were administered to the spider''s abdomen and the hub of the web.

TI INFANTICIDE IN MALE LABORATORY MICE - EFFECTS OF SOCIAL-STATUS, PRIOR
   SEXUAL EXPERIENCE, AND BASIS FOR DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN RELATED AND
   UNRELATED YOUNG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Several aspects of infanticide, including effects of social status, prior sexual experience, and the basis for discrimination between related and unrelated young, were examined in Swiss-Webster laboratory mice (Mus musculus). Strange males introduced into the female''s cage for 24 h on day 1 postpartum significantly reduced pup survival; the introduction of sires did not. Direct observations of infanticide are frequent, and the motor patterns used by males to kill pups are described. Males killed their own offspring when those young were in the nest of a strange female; most males did not kill unrelated young in the nest of a familiar female. Thus, past association with the mother appears to be the single most important factor mediating male discrimination of young. Prior contact with a specific female''s urine reduced a male''s propensity for subsequently killing her young. The act of copulation itself also reduced infanticide. Infanticidal behavior was correlated with the male''s social status: most dominant males killed unrelated pups; none of the subordinates engaged in infanticide. These results are discussed in terms of the population biology of this species.

TI THE BIOPHYSICS OF PIT CONSTRUCTION BY ANTLION LARVAE (MYRMELEON,
   NEUROPTERA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An antlion pit is lined with fine particles during construction. This feature appears to increase the effectiveness of the pit in prey capture. Pit structure is influenced by physical properties of sand and the building behavior of the antlion. Two physical properties of sand govern pit structure: the angle of repose and Stoke''s Law drag force. These 2 properties complement each other as follows. Since larger particles have a lower angle of repose than smaller particles, fine sand grains tend to stay on the pit walls; larger particles fall to the pit''s center. Large particles have a lower drag to momentum ratio than do small particles. Thus, larger particles are more likely to be thrown out of the pit than are smaller particles. Several behavioral modifications were demonstrated that increase the number of fine particles on the pit walls while reducing construction costs for the antlion. A trajectory angle of 45.degree. is used when the antlion throws particles out of the pit. This angle will maximize the distance to which larger particles are thrown. A trajectory angle of 60.degree. is used at the end of pit construction when the antlion is throwing fine particles on the sides of the pit. This angle reduces the number of these fine particles leaving the pit. Antlions can alter the velocity with which they throw particles. When discarding prey carcasses and debris that have accumulated during prey capture, they use a velocity that is approximately 39% higher than the velocity used during pit construction. By vibrating their forelegs, antlions appear to sift out the finer particles before each throw. This increases the percentage of larger particles discarded from the pit.

TI BEHAVIORAL-ANALYSIS OF LINES SELECTED FOR WING VIBRATION IN
   DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB After artificial selection for a component of the male courtship display, percentage wing vibration (PWV) and the changes to both courtship and non-courtship behaviors were examined. The changes in PWV during selection were attributed to changes in vibration bout length. Licking and attempted copulation changed with PWV; these components of the display are probably linked. Activity was higher in the lines selected for increased PWV than in those selected for decreased PWV. Differences were also detected in wing area and courtship song. The low-PWV males were more successful than high-PWV males in obtaining mates in a competitive situation, indicating that PWV is one of several factors influencing the stimulating qualities of the males.

TI INHIBITION OF MATING-BEHAVIOR BEFORE FEEDING IN THE TICK
   APONOMMA-HYDROSAURI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When on their host [Trachydosaurus rugosus], both male and female adults of the reptile tick A. hydrosauri require at least 5 days of feeding before normal mating behavior will start. In off-host trials, fed females attract significantly more male contact than do unfed females, but unfed males show normal mating behavior. All aspects of female mating behavior are inhibited before feeding. Male mating behavior has 2 stages: one comprises detachment and searching, and the other, courtship behavior. Only the former is inhibited before male feeding. The female signal probably has 2 components: one initiating searching and the other initiating courtship. Males will always respond to the 2nd component, but only after feeding will they respond to the first.

TI NONRANDOM MATING BY SIZE IN AMERICAN TOADS, BUFO-AMERICANUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male American toads, B. americanus, captured in amplexus at least once during the season were significantly longer than males captured only singly in the same breeding population in all 3 cases studied. Absence of any correlation between the body lengths of the members of amplexing pairs argues against selection for optimal relative size. Males successful at breeding were those that were larger, were at the pond more nights, and spent more time calling than unsuccessful males. Residency did not enhance breeding success, however, since on any given day successful males were equally likely to come from recaptured males previously present at the pond and unmarked males presumed new to the pond. Amount of movement about the pond did not vary with breeding success; all males tended to remain in one area on any given night and to change areas between nights. A very low displacement rate (about 7%) of males in amplexus argues against primacy of this form of male-male competition in producing differential mating by size. Rather it appears that some combination of other forms of intrasexual competition and female choice caused the mating pattern seen.

   EUPHYDRYAS-EDITHA BUTTERFLIES - THE BEHAVIORAL MECHANISMS CAUSING
   CLUMPED DISTRIBUTIONS OF EGG CLUSTERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Egg clusters of the checkerspot butterfly, E. edithia, are contagiously distributed among host plants (Pedicularis semibarbata) at one mid-elevation montaine site in California. Large, isolated plants receive more egg clusters than is expected from their proportional representation in the population. This study attempts to determine the behavioral causes of that contagious distribution. Non-random alighting by ovipositing females appears to be the primary cause of the observed contagious distribution. Females alight more often than would be expected by chance on large, isolated plants. Females also appear to exhibit a weak post-alighting bias in favor of large, isolated plants, although this bias is not statistically significant. Manipulative experiments reveal that post-alighting acceptance is not random; certain plants are accepted repeatedly while others are rejected repeatedly. Searching females also distinguish among different classes of plants within a host species.

TI THE MATING-BEHAVIOR OF THE EGYPTIAN COTTON LEAFWORM MOTH,
   SPODOPTERA-LITTORALIS (BOISD)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A study of courtship in S. littoralis showed that there were 4 significant behavior patterns. The male flew to a calling female and hovered above her with his brushes fully extended. In response, the female lifted her wings, curved her abdomen and withdrew her pheromone gland. The male settled beside the female to pair and then moved to hang head downwards during copulation. Thirty percent of successful courtships lacked 1 of the main behavior patterns. Nearly half of the courtships observed did not end in copulation; none of these included all of 4 major behavior patterns and the majority lacked 2 or 3. Females often rejected males with a rapid flick of the wings. Antennaless males did not mate or extend the brushes in response to a calling female. Just over half of the antennaless females observed during 135-min tests mated with normal males, but courtship was abnormal. Olfactory cues appeared to be important to females in recognizing the courting male, since antennaless females did not flick their wings, were significantly more likely to take to flight as the result of the male brush display and frequently failed to retract the pheromone gland during the latter stages of courtship. The courtship behavior of S. littoralis is compared with published accounts of other Noctuids.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF INDIVIDUAL CALL RECOGNITION IN YOUNG RING-BILLED GULLS
   (LARUS-DELAWARENSIS) - EFFECT OF FEEDING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Individual recognition has been documented in young gulls, but less is known of the relevant developmental mechanisms. Since parents normally emit mew calls during feeding of the young, the hypothesis was tested that feeding with individually distinctive mew calls constitutes one such mechanism. Experimentally trained birds provided support for the hypothesis. Initially high approach and vocalization levels were maintained to the reinforced call, while responses to the other call declined, as did responses to both calls in untrained controls. Comparison with other species [L. atricilla and L. argentatus] suggests that this developmental pattern is adapted to the natal social environment. In gulls, food is a potentially important mechanism influencing call meaning between parents and offspring and between mates during courtship feeding.

TI THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MATING SYSTEM AND SIMULTANEOUS HERMAPHRODITISM
   IN THE CORAL-REEF FISH, HYPOPLECTRUS-NIGRICANS (SERRANIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior and reproductive ecology of the simultaneously hermaphroditic coral reef fish, H. nigricans (Serranidae), the black hamlet, was investigated to elucidate the relationship between simultaneous hermaphroditism and mating behavior. Hamlets spawn only in pairs, one partner releasing eggs and the other fertilizing them. There is no selfing. Eggs are planktonic. There is no parental care. The major courtship display serves to advertise that an individual has ripe eggs. A clutch is not released in a single spawn but is parcelled over several, usually with the same partner. Partners generally alternate sex roles with each spawn: that is, they take turns giving up parcels to be fertilized. This active reciprocation of release of eggs, called egg trading, means that reproductive success as a male depends upon the ability to reproduce as a female. Since most of the reproductive effort of an individual is spent on female functions, egg trading provides a fecundity advantage to hermaphroditism, making it evolutionarily stable relative to dioecy (separate sexes). The advantage is analogous to that which parthenogenetic organisms have over sexual ones. The fecundity advantage under egg trading can account for the maintenance, but not the origin of simultaneous hermaphroditism, since hermaphroditism must be established before egg trading can evolve.

TI PARENTAL INVESTMENT IN NEST DEFENSE BY STONECHATS (SAXICOLA-TORQUATA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Breeding stonechats (S. torquata) made mixed sequences of 2 calls when a human intruder entered territories. Whits are modulated notes with a small frequency range, and in laboratory tests caused nestlings to stop begging. Chacks cover a wide range of frequencies, and in the field were combined with flights made so as to distract an intruder from the nest. On average male and female call-rates were similar, but varied greatly according to the intruder''s distance from the nest and at different stages of the nesting cycle. Rates increased rapidly after hatching; this correlated most closely with the cumulative total of parents'' visits to feed nestlings. The level of defense may be adjusted to the value of the offspring to their parents. Call-rates declined about 1 wk after fledging. A smaller peak by some pairs at the start of incubation was apparently related to probable poor condition after a previous breeding attempt, and after laying large clutches. Rates of whits were higher at nests with larger broods, up to an asymptote, but rates of chacks were independent of brood size. Birds suffering nest-predation showed lower call-rates before the event than equivalent successful birds, suggesting that the calls reduce the risk of predation.

Examination of the won and lost fights of individual crabs failed to show any consistent differences in the rate of information transfer. Crabs that had higher rates of transfer (both in their won and lost fights) won significantly more interactions. Based upon the information transfer values observed, a mixed-strategy model of communication is outlined.

The changes in investigation time were replicated by administering estradiol benzoate followed after 40 h by progesterone, to ovariectomized rats, suggesting an endocrine basis. Most bouts of investigation were terminated by a move straight to another object, suggesting that it had been chosen before the move was made.

TI WEB-SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR TOLERANCE AND GROUP PREDATION IN THE SOCIAL
   SPIDER MALLOS-GREGALIS SIMON
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Most spiders are aggressive and cannibalistic but M. gregalis lives in large, tolerant colonies where prey is caught communally. Tolerance and communal predation can be attributed to vibration transmitting characteristics of the communally built sheet-web. Sine wave vibrations on the web are attenuated below 30 Hz and above 700 Hz. Within this range, resonance peaks correlate with communal predation behavior. The web enhances fly vibrations at frequencies in the optimal vibration sensitivity range of spiders. This modulated vibration forms the communal predation cue, co-ordinating concurrent behavior of many individuals. Conspecifics do not elicit communal predation because their walking vibrations are attenuated. This tolerance mechanism and system for discriminating prey from conspecifics makes a social lifestyle possible for these predatory animals.

AB Visual and auditory stimuli associated with feeding may lead to enhanced feeding behavior in others. Since only visual stimuli were effective alone, with auditory stimuli simply enhancing the response to the former, sounds may be effective via some general arousal-like variable. The sounds alone of one bird feeding may lead to a short-term synchrony of feeding between 2 individuals. An explanation in terms of arousal is both unlikely and overcomplex and instead, a specific interaction of auditory and visual cues is likely to be involved.

DT Article
AB Hooded rats born in the laboratory were exposed in their home cages to objects (cut-out triangles and circles) which were to be used as the stimuli in a subsequent visual simultaneous discrimination task. Control subjects received no prior exposure. In confirmation of the results of Gibson and Walk (1956) it was found that rats given exposure to the stimuli when still immature showed positive transfer to discrimination learning in adulthood. Facilitation of learning was also found in subjects exposed to the stimuli in adulthood. The relevance of these findings to theories of the special effects of early experience and to current theories of the effects of stimulus-exposure is discussed.

TI TOLERABLE FEEDBACK - MECHANISM FOR BEHAVIORAL-CHANGE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A concept of motivational dominance is derived from a consideration of the state-space approach to motivation. A model is presented for the disinhibition of displacement activities during conflict situations. This occurs when the feedback discrepancy between the acutal and expected consequences of performing an activity exceeds some tolerable limit. This limit varies as a precise function of the current motivational state of the animal, since each activity may be characterized by a particular tolerable feedback curve. Curve shape determines the extent to which different activities can be squashed in situations of constraint. A single mechanism controlling the nature of the current expected feedback could underlie both competition and disinhibition. A system of dynamic internal measurement scales, represented by the complete set of theoretically determinable tolerable feedback curves, is able to incorporate both homeostatic and non-homeostatic activities.

TI COMPONENTS OF SONG USED FOR SPECIES RECOGNITION IN THE COMMON
   YELLOWTHROAT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Territorial male common yellowthroats (G. trichas) were presented modified songs to determine the species-identifying song components. Presentations were paired, with the response elicited by a synthetic normal song (control) compared to that elicited by modified songs. Modified songs in which the frequency range was held constant yet lowered by 1 kHz from the average elicited a response that was significantly lower than the control. Doubling internote time intervals resulted in lower responses. Removing downslurred and unsplurred hooks on notes did not alter responses. A simple 2-noted repeated phrase song, one note an upstroke, the other a downstroke, with a frequency envelope of approximately 2-6 kHz, may provide the minimum requirements for species recognition.

TI THREAT DISPLAY IN BETTA-SPLENDENS - EFFECTS OF WATER CONDITION AND TYPE
   OF AGONISTIC STIMULATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Threat display in male Siamese fighting fish was studied with respect to 2 types of water condition: water in which a conspecific had previously performed threat display and water in which conspecifics had been wounded during a pair encounter. No effects were found for either type of water condition when compared with control groups studied in normal water. Differences were noted, however, between the 3 types of agonistic stimulation used to release threat display: mirror presentation produced a larger amount of display than a conspecific placed behind a glass partition, which in turn elicited more threat than an opponent in an actual fight. Air gulping was correlated with the various threat components measured and appears to be an integral part of agonistic behavior in this species.

TI REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR OF CAPTIVE WHITE-TAILED DEER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations on reproductive behavior of captive yearling white-tailed deer (20 female and 3 male Odocoileus virginianus) were made from 5 Nov. 1974 to 2 Jan. 1975. Females were introduced individually into a 3.65 .times. 7.30-m pen with 1 of the males for a period of 5 min every day. Sexually receptive females were left with the males for longer periods, during which behavioral observations were recorded. Typical behavior of males when a female entered the pen was to nose and lick the perineum and tarsal glands, and exhibit the Flehmen posture. Females not in estrus did not allow the male to mount and avoided his efforts by fleeing about the pen. When this occurred, the males would usually attack non-receptive does, butting them in the side and abdominal area. During estrus the female exhibited a mating stance and permitted the male to mount and copulate. Copulation invariably terminated with an ejaculatory thrust by the male. The female then assumed a post-copulatory posture that resembled the urination posture in many respects.

TI BEHAVIORAL AND HORMONAL RESPONSES OF MALE RHESUS-MONKEYS INTRODUCED TO
   FEMALES IN BREEDING AND NON-BREEDING SEASONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Adult male rhesus monkeys (6) were introduced individually to an all-female group for 10 days during the mating season. The initial aggressive responses of the females were rapidly replaced by positive social behavior, and each male acheived alpha status and had access to social and sexual partners. A repetition of this paradigm in the non-breeding season produced significantly more female aggression, and no male attained high rank or engaged in sexual or other social behavior. Male testosterone levels rose following introduction to the females in both seasons, but were significantly higher during the breeding season. Hormonal levels following removal from the females suggest a complex interplay between social, sexual and social variables and recent social experiences. The differences in female social behavior with newly introduced males, as a function of season, suggest an explanation for the seasonal limitation of male troop transfers.

TI AGGRESSION AND SUBMISSION IN MONKEY SOCIETIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Recent challenges to the social dominance theory as applied to monkeys include unwarranted generalizations. Observations on wild Barbary macaques Macaca sylvanus show that hierarchies definitely occur in nature and that they are not simply artifacts of captivity, and that natural hierarchies can be maintained by the joint action of dominant and subordinate animals. It is consequently necessary to reassess the theory that stress is the prime factor which produces a hierarchy. The part played by an individual is best understood by examining the contribution of its agonistic behavior to its fitness.

TI FIELD-STUDY OF HAPLOCHROMIS-BURTONI - QUANTITATIVE BEHAVIORAL
   OBSERVATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB H. burtoni observed in their natural habitat behave differently from those observed in aquaria in several respects. The majority of the territoral males observed in Lake Tanganyika [Africa] living in a colony did not have the characteristic black eye bar as a part of their bright coloration, although otherwise the color markings were identical. Those animals with eye bars appeared at a disadvantage in competition with barless fish for territories. The non-territorial males, females and juveniles are uniformly cryptically colored and remained together in 2 or 3 large schools on the edge of the colony. These schools drifted slowly through the colony area, attempting to feed in the territories. Territorial males solicited females and chased non-territorial males. Sequences of behavioral events performed during courtship varied, depending on the local population density. Sound recordings showed no purposeful sounds associated with any behavioral acts.

TI AGONISTIC DISPLAY AND SPACING IN BLACK-HEADED GULL, LARUS-RIDIBUNDUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Black-headed gulls nesting on islands in a marsh habitat had a higher breeding success than those nesting on the periphery of the colony. Island birds maintained close inter-nest distances whereas peripheral nests were spaced further apart as predation of eggs increased. These changes in spacing corresponded with changes in the response distances of agonistic displays. There was no change during incubation for island birds but peripheral birds displayed to intruders at much greater distances than during pair formation. Island birds were more likely to attack and display more frequently to intruders than peripheral birds. In one season the peripheral birds were more aggressive during pair formation because of an increase in intrusions by unpaired females.

TI OPTIMAL PREY SELECTION IN GREAT TIT (PARUS-MAJOR)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The predictions of an optimal foraging model using 5 captive great tits as predators was tested. The birds were presented with 2 prey types, profitable and unprofitable, on a moving belt. Both prey types were made out of mealworms. When the encounter rate with both prey types was low, the birds were non-selective, but at a higher encounter rate with profitable prey, the birds selectively ignored the less profitable type and did so irrespective of the encounter rate with them. These results are as predicted by the model, but the birds did not as predicted change from no selection in a single step. This is probably because the birds invest time in sampling to determine the availability and profitability of different prey types.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior of free-living Alpine marmots, M. marmota, was studied from June 1-Aug. 19, 1973 in Vanoise National Park, France. Comparing animals of the same sex and age class, individual differences in behavior generally were greater between colonies than within colonies. Individual differences among adults exceeded those of yearlings, and greater individual differences occurred with regard to social behavior than with relatively asocial behavior. General patterns of social biology resembled those of the North American marmots, except for a tendency for adult males to remain somewhat away from and at higher elevation than their colonies, and a distinctly lower frequency of greeting behavior. Implications of these findings for the evolution of marmot social behavior are discussed.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Adult female baboons [Papio cynocephalus ursinus] were studied over a 15 mo. period which included sexual cycling, pregnancy and lactation. Females could be ranked in a linear dominance hierarchy which accurately predicted the direction, but not the frequency, or agonistic interactions. Females were most attractive to others during lactation, receiving less aggression, more friendly gestures, more grooming and grooming by more different individuals than females in other reproductive states. In all 3 reproductive states high-ranking females were more attractive than others. When differences in behavior related to changes in reproductive state were factored out, individual females groomed animals next to themselves in the dominance hierarchy more than others. A model is presented showing how rank-related access and attractiveness may interact to perpetuate this distribution of grooming over time.

TI LUNAR PERIODICITY OF SPHECODOGASTRA TEXANA A NOCTURNAL BEE (HYMENOPTERA
   - HALICTIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A 3-year study of S. texana (Cresson), revealed that its life cycle and habits were intimately connected with the 29-day cycle of the moon. The foraging activity of the bee was divided into 2 parts, the crepuscular period and the moonlight period. During the crepuscular period, S. texana foraged only briefly between sunset and the end of twilight. Extended foraging under moonlight seemed to come as a prolonging of twilight foraging as long as the moon was present before the bees plugged their nest entrances. Further evidence of lunar periodicity was shown in a re-analysis of the daily fluctuations in numbers of S. texana caught in a light-trap by Chandler, in brood cell contents as revealed by dissections of nests, and in the architecture of old nests excavated in Aug., 1964.

LA English

AB Cats, domestic fowl, guppies and rats (n=441) were raised in groups or individually and with or without manipulable objects beginning at different ages and for varying periods of time before administration of a preference test for either another animal or the objects. In chickens, the longer the duration of the environment, the greater the approach to another animal, although this relationship is influenced by the environmental condition. In cats both the nature of the environment and duration affect preference. In rats, regardless of environment, prefernce is between 58 and 82% of the time for the animal. Guppies of all ages and environments prefer object over animal.

TI TURN ALTERNATION IN PILL BUG (ARMADILLIDIUM VULGARE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB After the isopod crustacean Armadillidium vulgare is forced to make a turn in a T-maze, it turns in the opposite direction at the first choice point (turn alternation, TA). The mean TA angle is a linear function of the angle of the initial forced turn, but is independent of the distance between the forced turn and choice point, over a range of 5-50 cm. TA in pill bugs appears to be mediated by a form of short-term memory, and therefore the pill bug may be a suitable "simple" organism for the neurophysiological study of memory. The functional significance of TA may lie in the fact that it leads to temporary orientation toward vertical surfaces.

TI EFFECTS OF GENOTYPE ON MOUSE BEHAVIOUR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behavioral differences between (i) the strains DBA/2J, C57BL/6J, and their F1 hybrids, and (ii) homozygous and heterozygous short-ear (se) animals were examined. More than thirty stereotyped behavioral components performed by single male house mice and by pairs of males when placed into an observation cage, and avoidance behavior in a shock escape box were taken into consideration. Many strain differences not described previously were established; others generally confirmed earlier findings. Strain DBA/2J is mainly characterized by low scores for various locomotory and exploratory activities, and strain C57BL/6J by low values for feeding behavior, defecation, grooming, and aggressiveness. There was no clear-cut difference in active avoidance learning between these strains. The B6D2F1 hybrid showed evidence of hybrid vigor, they rated high particularly with regard to leaning postures, climbing, manipulation of bedding material, and learning performance. The se locus influenced avoidance behavior; mutants did less well than non-mutants. No effect upon the frequencies of fixed action patterns or upon general activity was observed.

TI METHODS FOR MEASURING 3-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF FISH SCHOOLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two methods are discribed for measuring the 3-dimensional co-ordinates of the individual fish in a school photographed from above. The Stereo Method uses a double-prism device which produces 2 images on the film taken from positions slightly apart, and the distance of the fish from the camera can be determined by its parallax against the background. The Shadow Method depends on the fact that the shadow of an object in the sun is farther to the side the higher the object above the background. The coordinates in the horizontal plane are easily determined once the distance of the fish from the background is known. The advantages and disadvantages of the 2 methods are considered, and a sample set of photographs of a school of 10 pilchards, made with the Shadow Method, is analysed. These results are then used to calculate the distance and bearing in the horizontal and vertical planes between nearest neighbors in the school, and to give information about the regularities in geometrical spacing of the fish. The photographs were also measured to show to what extent the fish were swimming parallel.

AB Microplastics are an emerging threat to aquatic and terrestrial species, and growing evidence suggests a suite of negative impacts, including reduced food consumption and direct physiological effects. Uptake of microplastics by animals can occur passively through accidental ingestion (i.e. fish swimming through contaminated water and taking microplastics into their buccal cavity/gills), or through active selection and consumption of particles. The rate of active plastic consumption for any animal depends on how well it can recognize and avoid eating the plastic. This likely has important impacts on the animal's health and fitness, with subsequent impacts on reproductive fitness. In this study we explored the willingness of bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, to directly consume microplastics (small, easily consumable pieces of high- density polyethylene bag films or polypropylene rope fibres) and whether this varied with continued exposure over time. Wild-caught bluegill were stocked in groups of three or six individuals in 37-litre aquaria and offered food (controls) or microplastics followed by food over a period of 4e6 days. Results showed that direct consumption of microplastics declined over time while foraging on food increased, indicating learned avoidance of microplastics. Foraging was impacted by plastic type, with bluegill more likely to forage on films than on fibres. Following group testing, each fish underwent an individual test for swimming endurance in a modified swim apparatus; however, no significant differences were found in swimming performance between treatments. Our results add to the growing literature revealing how animals, including fish, may actively consume microplastics and the potential effects of that exposure.

AB Adult treehoppers have a greatly expanded pronotum (the first thoracic sclerite), forming diverse and elaborate three-dimensional shapes whose development is not fully understood. We filmed imaginal ecdysis and postecdysis of the treehopper Ennya chrysura to describe events during pronotal expansion, looking for insights into their extreme morphologies. Behavioural and hydraulic mechanisms are involved, as suggested by the timing and coordination of abdominal contractions during wing and pronotal expansion. Compared to other insects, all individuals showed an additional second phase of pronotal expansion. The precedence of the wing over pronotal expansion suggests that internal mechanisms allow control of haemolymph influx into the pronotum. We discuss possible developmental complications derived from extreme pronotal growth and outline new research directions to better understand the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity and their roles in the evolution of treehopper morphology. Finally, we join to celebrate William Eberhard and Mary Jane West-Eberhard as leading, creative biologists. Inspired by their work, we share reflections emphasizing the first part of the theme for this special issue: the importance of detailed behaviour observations for finding biologically relevant questions.

AB Dialects and accents in human speech have a demonstrated social function as markers of group identity and often serve as psychological foundations of trust and cooperation. The extent to which this phenomenon is a feature of primate communication more generally is still debated. Here, we show that the vocal signatures of bonobos, Pan paniscus, belonging to three social groups show group-specific acoustic features independent of genetic relatedness. We compared the barks of 22 adults from the three groups and found that individuals currently living together had more similar barks than individuals that had never met or had lost touch with each other, regardless of their degree of genetic relatedness. We concluded that group-specific vocal accommodation is present in bonobos, suggesting an early evolutionary emergence of vocal plasticity in apes, which could be a means to signal social closeness between individuals.

AB The optimal timing of sexual behaviours across a daily cycle can form a key component of mating and reproductive success. However, few studies have explored circadian rhythms in mating behaviour within the context of sexual selection and sexual conflict. Here we characterized circadian patterns in female receptivity to mating and the frequency of male mating and courtship behaviours in freely interacting captive groups of red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, in outdoor enclosures. We showed that patterns of male sexual behaviour and female resistance to mating attempts differ between the morning and evening during a 10-day mating trial. Females progressively reduced their level of resistance to male mating attempts during the early hours of the morning and progressively increased their resistance in the evening. Males did not match their mating frequencies to female receptivity and initiated mating attempts more often in the evening, but tended to perform more courtship displays in the morning. The pattern of male behaviour was associated with social status, such that dominant males courted females more often than subordinates, particularly in the morning. However, we did not find strong evidence that male social status was associated with different timing strategies. These results demonstrate circadian patterns in multiple sexual behaviours in red junglefowl, with potential consequences for sexual selection in this species and welfare management in domestic populations of closely related fowl.

AB Individual specialization may occur relative to diet, behaviour or spatial distribution, potentially leading to differential resource and space use within a population. While specializations have been documented across many animal populations, the underlaying causes of individual specialization (e.g. morphology, age or sex) are not always identified. Causes of specialization can be especially challenging to uncover for large, long-lived marine animals. We used a Bayesian multilevel, multinomial logistic regression model to study the relationships between grey whale, Eschrichtius robustus, use of foraging tactics and morphology (body length and condition), while accounting for habitat characteristics and individual variation in tactic use. The model was informed by a 7-year longitudinal data set of concurrent morphology and foraging behaviour collected using drones. We found evidence of an ontogenetic shift in the use of foraging tactics associated with body length (a proxy for age). Individual specialization in behaviour was also associated with water depth and habitat. After accounting for the effects of these covariates, there was some residual individual level variation in the use of different foraging tactics. Our findings demonstrate variation in resource and habitat use within a baleen whale population at the individual level relative to body length and habitat, suggesting that individual spatial distribution and access to prey may vary by age class. Our results can be applied to investigate whether juveniles and adults differ in their foraging success and resilience to stressors. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Losing aggressive contests may impact survival, reproductive success and animal welfare. Previous experience plays an important role in shaping contest behaviour, but less is known about how individual variation in learning abilities influences contest dynamics and resource-holding potential. Here, we investigated whether learning performance (acquisition learning and reversal learning) in domestic pigs, Sus scrofa, predicts the outcome of a contest against an unfamiliar opponent. While acquisition learning speed did not predict contest outcome, pigs that successfully learned the reversal were more likely to win the contest than pigs that failed to learn the reversal. As expected, weight difference between opponents was also an important factor in predicting contest outcome. Our results suggest that cognitive flexibility may confer an advantage in contests, unless pigs already have a substantial weight advantage over their opponent. These findings advance our understanding of the role of cognitive processes in animal contests and suggest that promoting cognitive flexibility may reduce the potential welfare impacts arising from stressful social defeat. Further research is required to determine whether cognitive flexibility influences assessment strategy and allows pigs to resolve contests with fewer costs. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

ID EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; VIGILANCE; TRIALS; RISK
AB Behavioural ecologists frequently collect data that involve the potential for subjective judgement, so it is important that researchers in the field develop awareness of potential issues around bias in data collection. We report the results of an undergraduate classroom experiment in which we estimated the potential for students' a priori expectations to bias their estimates of behaviour. Prior to conducting a set of behavioural observations on a video-recorded flock of foraging pigeons, we randomly primed half of the students to expect the pigeons to be hungry, while the other half were primed to expect the pigeons to be satiated. Students were blind to the treatment and subsequently estimated two variables expected to differ in their potential for subjectivity: the proportion of birds in the flock that were feeding (potentially subjective), and the feeding (peck) rates of two focal individuals (potentially objective). Surprisingly, we found no evidence that observer bias affected the estimate of the percentage of birds foraging. By contrast, we found a large effect of observer bias on feeding rate estimates, with students who expected a hungry state recording inflated feeding rate estimates relative to those that expected a satiated state. We furthermore found that students' expectations of foraging state did not always match their allocated primers: bias was predicted by 'expected state' but not by 'allocated state'. Our experiment illustrates that bias associated with expectation can influence results. Furthermore, a variable we initially expected to be relatively objective proved to have a strong subjective element, inflating the effect of confirmation bias on estimation. We recommend blind data recording even when response variables are thought to be objective, as well as explicit teaching of university students about the potential for bias in data collection, and our experiment suggests a potentially useful way in which this can be undertaken.

AB Because senescence impairs the ability of older males to compete successfully for mates, male reproductive strategies are expected to change with age. The terminal investment hypothesis proposes that older males, who could die soon, should take greater risks to obtain mating opportunities. Another possibility is that older males avoid such risks, adopting alternative reproductive tactics, such as increased affiliation with females, increased reliance on coalitions or sexual coercion to continue to compete with younger animals. We tested these hypotheses in wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, of the Kanyawara community, Kibale National Park, Uganda, where old males sire offspring at relatively high rates. Our data set included >40 000 incidents of male aggression and >5800 copulations observed between 2005 and 2017. We found that, even as their dominance status declined, old males maintained relatively high copulation rates, especially with established mothers. There was no evidence for terminal investment in response to ageing. Males became generally less aggressive as they aged. Neither did old males form affiliative bonds with females, nor use sexual coercion more frequently, as alternative reproductive tactics. Old males did, however, participate in coalitionary aggression at higher rates than young males and increased the proportion of their aggression that was coalitionary over time. Coalitions were positively associated with mating success, particularly for low- and middle-ranking males. These results support the hypothesis that ageing male chimpanzees use coalitions as an alternative reproductive tactic. The lack of evidence for terminal investment in response to ageing appears to reflect a broader mammalian pattern in which males who rely on fighting to secure mating opportunities avoid excessive risk taking as their formidability wanes.

AB Reading another animal's emotional state can enable receivers to anticipate their behavioural motivations, which is important in guiding interactions with that individual. For species living closely alongside humans, the emotional cues that we express can be almost as informative as those of conspecifics. Goats, Capra hircus, can discriminate differences in emotional valence present in another goat's calls, and we investigated whether this ability extends to human speech. We presented goats with a habituationdishabituation-rehabituation paradigm, where they experienced multiple playbacks of a familiar or unfamiliar human voice conveying a single emotional valence (e.g. angry; habituation phase), before the valence of the voice changed (e.g. happy; dishabituation phase) and then reversed again in line with the habituation phase (e.g. angry; rehabituation phase). Over the habituation phase, goats' behavioural responses decreased, showing evidence of having habituated to the playback stimuli presented. Following a change in emotional valence (dishabituation phase), although goats were overall less likely to respond, those that did looked for longer, suggesting they had perceived the shift in emotional content conveyed in human voice playbacks. We found no changes in physiological arousal (heart rate or heart rate variability) with shifts in playback valence. Domesticated goats may have developed a sensitivity to our cues over their long association with us, but the differences in individual behaviour towards the playback paradigm could highlight a role for learning and individual experience in particular in interspecific emotional communication.

AB Sea turtles face a risk of extinction due to climate change causing warming of nests, which may increase both sex ratio skews, with fewer males being produced, and embryo mortality in nests. In theory, these threats could be mitigated by turtles switching their nest sites to cooler locations on beaches. We assessed nest positioning for green turtles, Chelonia mydas, in the Chagos Archipelago, a major nesting site in the Indian Ocean, and showed that nests were generally in vegetation at the back of the beach, where the risk of sea water inundation was lowest. The relatively few nests on the open beach were on average close to the vegetation. Sand temperatures at nest depths were similar across three beach zones (open sand, edge of vegetation, within the vegetation). Nest positioning was reviewed for 51 studies at 53 sites (including the current study) across the globe and across seven species: green turtles, hawksbills, Eretmochelys imbricata, loggerheads, Caretta caretta, leatherbacks, Dermochelys coriacea, olive ridleys, Lepidochelys olivacea, Kemp's ridleys, Lepidochelys kempii, and flatbacks, Natator depressus. Both in the Chagos Archipelago and across the globe studies show turtles generally tend to crawl a sufficient distance to minimize sea water overwash of nests, which can kill embryos. Hence maximizing embryo survival, rather than considerations of hatchling sex ratios, seems to be the main driver for nest positioning and so we conclude that sea turtles are, generally, unlikely to switch to select cooler beach sites to mitigate climate warming.

AB Identity cues in animal calls are essential for conspecific vocal individual recognition. Some acoustically active species mainly show reliable identity cues in their vocalizations because of variation in anatomy and life history. Long and strenuous-to-produce vocalizations may be particularly effective for showing identity cues because sustaining such calls may reveal individual anatomical differences in sound production. It is largely unknown whether reptiles possess acoustic individuality despite some groups being vocal. We analysed 814 bellows from 47 American alligators, Alligator mississippiensis, extracting spectral characteristics and manually corrected contours of the fundamental frequency. Recognition was up to 66% correct with a supervised classifier (random forest) and 61% with unsupervised clustering (chance 1/4 2.1%), indicating that individual alligators have highly distinct bellows. Alligators were distinguished primarily based on the call spectrum, fundamental frequency contour and amplitude modulation, which also provided information about the animal's size. Neither manual supervision of acoustic analyses nor supervised training on labelled data was necessary to achieve reasonable accuracy, which has promising potential for identification of individuals via passive acoustic monitoring for research and conservation purposes. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of studying the utilization of acoustic individuality in the social lives of crocodylians. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Camouflage plays a significant role in preventing and facilitating predation. A common method used by many species to avoid detection is to match aspects of the visual background. Behaviour can constitute a valuable component of camouflage by enabling animals to choose appropriate substrates, yet how widespread this is remains relatively underexplored. Through a series of substrate choice experiments we tested whether the highly phenotypically diverse common shore crab shows substrate preferences, and whether preferences reflect choices that actively improve individual camouflage. Using image analysis, we compared brightness and colour metrics of crabs to their chosen versus alternative substrates. Crabs tended to choose substrates with a brightness that better matched their own appearance. However, choices depended on the exact backgrounds offered, for example with crabs preferring backgrounds resembling native rock pool colour patterns over those resembling mudflats, but showing little difference in choice between red and green substrates. The results help explain observations that shore crabs and other animals show phenotype-environment associations at a microscale and demonstrate how individuals can maintain camouflage in highly variable visual environments. Our study shows that substrate preferences can be a key route to enabling camouflage in a broad spectrum of species. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB As the world's human population continues to concentrate within urban areas and these landscapes continue to expand worldwide, wildlife is under pressure to adapt to novel environmental disturbances. Along wild-to-urban gradients, and especially within less developed areas, human recreation can affect wildlife behaviour. These effects may be most apparent during peaks in human recreational activity. In this study, we used data from a large-scale citizen science camera trapping project to assess whether periodic increases in human recreational activity elicit behavioural responses across multiple mammal species in northern Utah, U.S.A. Specifically, we assessed whether increases in human recreational ac-tivity during the weekend affected mammalian temporal activity patterns at the community-wide and species-specific level. In general, we found little evidence supporting the presence of a temporal 'weekend effect'. At the community-wide scale, we found that mammalian diel activity patterns did not change in response to periodic increases in human recreational activity during the weekend. On the species-specific scale, only elk, Cervus canadensis, and rock squirrel, Otospermophilus variegatus, signifi-cantly altered temporal activity patterns during the weekend. However, people significantly altered temporal activity during the weekend, with more activity occurring in midday and less activity occurring in the early evening, leading to consistent decreases in human-wildlife temporal overlap. This study highlights the possibility of altered human activity patterns during periods of increased rates of activity serving as a human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategy.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Brood is critically important in social insect colonies. It carries the colony's fitness by delivering future reproductive adults as well as workers that will increase the colony's workforce. Adoption of non-nestmate brood can increase the colony workforce but entails the risk of rearing unrelated sexuals or social parasites. Thus, theory would predict that ant workers will evolve the ability to discriminate be-tween nestmate and alien brood using the chemical cues displayed at the brood's surface. This appears especially true for eggs and first-instar (L1) larvae, which require more resources than older brood before becoming adult workers. However, the chemical signature of ant early brood stages and its recognition by workers remains understudied. To fill this gap, we investigated the chemical basis of early brood nestmate and cross-species recognition in six ant species. We also tested the discrimination behaviour of workers in brood retrieval trials. We observed species level cues and discrimination against hetero-specific brood. We also found that eggs and most L1 larvae displayed a colony signature. However, only some species discriminated against non-nestmate early brood. Interestingly, these species belong to genera subject to brood parasitism. We hypothesize that non-nestmate brood discrimination could arise from species adaptations against brood parasitism.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In species in which individuals defend territories for long periods, it is common that rivals in neigh-bouring territories learn to recognize each other or their territory boundaries and reduce their mutual aggressiveness to decrease the costs of territorial defence ('dear enemy' phenomenon). Although the dear enemy phenomenon is generally evaluated in terms of aggressive behaviours between rivals, the ability to recognize neighbours ('dear enemy recognition') may affect other behaviours. In particular, antipredator behaviours may be mediated by the status of rivals (familiar neighbours or unfamiliar in-truders) because individuals may be more resistant to escape from predators if the nearby rivals are unfamiliar intruders than familiar neighbours that have not historically infringed on their territory. In this scenario, the ability to recognize familiar neighbours would affect an individual's escape decisions. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that resident males of the lizard Eurolophosaurus nanuzae adopt lower-risk antipredator behaviours after encountering a familiar neighbour than after encountering an unfamiliar intruder. For this, we measured lizards' flight initiation distance and time spent in a refuge under three conditions: after no recent contact with other males, after previous exposure to a familiar neighbour and after previous exposure to an unfamiliar intruder. We observed lower flight initiation distances for males that had encountered an unfamiliar intruder compared to a familiar neighbour, and we observed the greatest flight initiation distances when the same lizards had no recent contact with other individuals (familiar neighbours or unfamiliar intruders). As expected, lizards that had no contact with rivals spent more time hidden compared to lizards in the other treatments, but the time spent hidden was similar when lizards were exposed to a familiar neighbour or an unfamiliar intruder. These results indicate the existence of an important cognitive mechanism that allows individuals to recognize rivals along with their interaction history and modulate their initial escape strategy accordingly.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behavioural syndromes theory predicts animals will exhibit sets of correlated risk-taking behaviours, with individuals displaying a constant willingness to take risks across different situations. Because this phenomenon has mostly been investigated under artificial experimental conditions, we aimed to establish whether wild animals spontaneously exhibit correlated risk-taking behaviours. We merged a large data set of spatial positions from 43 wild boar, Sus scrofa, with the spatial distribution of risks, modelling their risk-induced resource selection. Elaborating these data by means of a resource selection analysis (step selection functions) and focusing only on periods when individuals were active represents an innovative approach to the study of spontaneous risk-taking behaviour exhibited across different situations. We sampled wild boar from two populations in southern Europe living in extremely different environmental conditions (mountainous versus Mediterranean area). We used model coefficients and parameters as quantitative measures of four different risk-taking behaviours (human avoidance, site fidelity, selection for covered habitat and mobility), for both the population and the individual level. A risk-taking syndrome was detected within both populations, with wild boar clustering in two groups sharing homogeneous sets of risk-taking behaviours. Contrary to the theoretical expectation which predicted individual use of consistent strategies, we observed a compensation among pairs of risk-taking behaviours, with individuals that could be considered risk avoiders on account of strong site fidelity and human avoidance being risk prone in terms of a low selection for covered habitats and a high mobility. Our results suggest that wild animals may adaptively exhibit strategies trading off different risk-taking behaviours. The similarities of risk-taking strategies in the two monitored populations suggested that the observed syndrome was not shaped by biotic or abiotic factors, but rather unintentionally caused by humans.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Personality may influence social living and the maintenance of alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). In some species, suppressing aggression may be important for facilitating social living, and different per-sonalities may be linked with different types of social associations. Yet, few studies have examined personality in species with low levels of aggression. In Cape ground squirrels, males have two discrete ARTs. Males either live in family groups ('natal') or all-male groups ('band') and lack physical aggression and territoriality. We measured docility (during trapping and handling in 2014-2019, Nmales 1/4 275) and activity and exploration (during an open field test in 2015, Nmales 1/4 34) in adult males to determine whether personality contributes to the maintenance of ARTs. We found repeatability in docility (adjusted repeatability 1/4 0.25-0.26) but not in activity or exploration, and docility was not associated with different ARTs. However, docility and ARTs were influenced by abiotic and biotic factors. Males were more docile after their first capture, and older males (longer on-site tenure) tended to be less docile. In years of higher rainfall, there were more band males, suggesting that ARTs may depend on ecological conditions. (c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB While habitat is often a limiting resource for group-living animals, we have yet to understand what aspects of habitat are particularly important for the maintenance of sociality. As anthropogenic distur-bances rapidly degrade the quality of many habitats, site-associated animals are facing additional stressors that may alter the trade-offs of moving or remaining philopatric. Here we examined how habitat health, size and saturation affect movement decisions of a coral-dwelling goby, the five-lined coral goby, Gobiodon quinquestrigatus , that resides within bleaching-susceptible Acropora coral hosts. To assess effects of habitat health, we translocated individuals far from their home corals into dead corals with the choice of adjacent healthy corals. To assess effects of habitat size and saturation, we manipu-lated coral sizes and the number of residents in healthy corals. Remarkably, 55% of gobies returned home regardless of treatment, 7% stayed in the new coral, and the rest were not found. Unlike other coral reef fishes, habitat factors did not affect how costs of movement influence group-living decisions in this species. These obligate coral-dwelling fishes preferred to home instead of choosing alternative habitat, which suggests a surprising awareness of their ecological surroundings. However, disregarding alter-native high-quality habitat is concerning as it may affect population persistence under conditions of rapid habitat degradation.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Understanding how subordinate altruistic roles arise among genetically similar individuals is critical to understanding the evolution of animal societies. In particular, maternal manipulation of offspring re-sources is an understudied process by which mothers may produce cooperative phenotypes among offspring. Mothers of the small carpenter bee Ceratina calcarata frequently produce a smaller under -provisioned daughter, known as the dwarf eldest daughter (DED) in the first cell of their nests. This DED is more subordinate and more easily coerced into helping siblings, aiding mothers in guarding and supplemental foraging and feeding of adult siblings. Colonies of these bees thus offer a unique opportunity to study the indirect effect of nutritional manipulation on behaviour, in particular mutual tolerance. We hypothesized that aggression would be greatest in the presence of DEDs, as they are actively coerced by their mothers to forage and feed their siblings. Here we experimentally added nutrition to the first cells of C. calcarata observation nests to test the effect of nutritional manipulation on colony intranidal behaviour. Using infrared cameras, control (N 1/4 13) and nutritionally supplemented nests (N 1/4 13) were observed for a total of 607.5 h. Behaviours were scored and categorized. Although aggression was unaffected, avoidant behaviour was greater in nutritionally supplemented nests. This study is the first experiment examining the effect of nutritional manipulation on intranidal behaviour in a stem nesting bee. Our results indicate that maternal manipulation and nutritional deprivation by mothers is critical to the production of mutual tolerance and division of labour.

AB Conspecific audiences have frequently been shown to affect behaviour during competitive interactions. However, research on audience effects has focused almost exclusively on how individual observers influence dyadic contests. Few studies have investigated more complex social scenarios, such as when groups defending a collective territory against outsiders can be monitored by neighbours. We used groups of the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher to test experimentally how the presence of neighbours influences group and individual level defence behaviour towards a female intruder, as well as associated within-group interactions. In the presence of neighbours, groups performed more defensive acts and spent more time defending their territory, but the nature of the response to neighbour presence differed between group members. Dominant females attacked intruders more, while subordinate females produced aggressive displays of longer mean duration; dominant males also tended to increase mean display duration. Despite the significant audience effects on defence behaviour, neighbour presence did not lead to any discernible changes in within-group aggression, affiliation or submission during the intrusions. Our study expands the small current literature on audience effects in group-living species and thus contributes to a fuller understanding of within- and between-group social dynamics.

AB Females of the potter wasp Delta dimidiatipenne collect caterpillars from the surrounding vegetation and place them inside their mud-constructed nest cells to provision their offspring. It has been observed that females frequently collect caterpillars that are already internally parasitized by the larvae of the gregarious parasitoid wasp Copidosoma primulum. In such cases, the potter wasp offspring's food supply may become depleted, and they may fail to complete their development, while the C. primulum offspring mature but remain trapped and eventually die within the mud cell. This raises the question: why do potter wasp females continue bringing parasitized caterpillars into their nests? We aimed at quantifying the fitness costs of this behaviour, while investigating the potential mechanisms sustaining it. For this, we conducted a field survey of Heliothis nubigera caterpillars, the most common prey of D. dimidiatipenne, from the nest cells and from the nearby vegetation. These were used to estimate the parasitism rate and, in laboratory experiments, to quantify the cost of feeding and developing on parasitized caterpillars, as well as the response of parasitized versus nonparasitized caterpillars to a simulated predator attack. We found that potter wasp larvae that were provisioned with parasitized caterpillars had reduced developmental success. Early potter wasp larval stages were indeed less likely to feed efficiently when provided with a single parasitized caterpillar compared to a nonparasitized one. Despite these costs, we found that female potter wasps seem to collect parasitized caterpillars more frequently than expected according to their occurrence in the vegetation. We found that parasitized caterpillars reached a higher body mass and were less active in their response to a simulated predator attack. These characteristics might contribute to the presumed attractiveness and higher susceptibility of parasitized caterpillars to the predatory potter wasps.

AB A fundamental assumption in predator-prey ecology is that prey responses comprise two main stages: escape when attack occurs or appears imminent and avoid the threat by seeking refuge until it has passed. While numerous studies have examined either initial prey responses to an approaching predator (flight initiation distance, FID), or subsequent hiding behaviour (e.g. latency to resume activity), to our knowledge, no previous studies have repeatedly tested multiple individuals in nature to quantify whether initial escape tendencies, behaviour during the escape and latency to resume activity are repeatable, and whether these stages of the antipredator response are correlated. The goal of this study was to explore how consistent spatial differences in rates of human activity shape risk-sensitive behaviour throughout multiple steps of the antipredator response (to humans) in California ground squirrels, Otospermophilus beecheyi, tested in various group sizes and environmental contexts across time. Our study provides the first example showing that, as predicted: FIDs, latencies to resume activity and other post-FID aspects of prey responses were repeatable and positively correlated at the among-individual level. This correlation is ecologically important in that it provides an underlying mechanism for a trade-off involving not only the cost versus benefit of early versus late escape, or early versus late emergence from refuge, but for a trade-off based on variation in fearfulness expressed across stages. Furthermore, we found that human activity influenced some, but not all, stages of the antipredator response. (c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In socially monogamous species, extrapair paternity typically results from extrapair copulations, but it can also be due to rapid mate switching. Oring, Fleischer, Reed, and Marsden (1992, Nature, 359 (6396), 631-633) proposed a mechanism to explain the occurrence of extrapair paternity in sequentially polyandrous species: sperm stored by females from within-pair copulations with a previous mate could fertilize eggs in the clutch of a subsequent male. Despite being proposed decades ago, evidence for this hypothesis remains limited. We studied social polyandry, extrapair paternity and copulation behaviour in a population of the red phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius, a nonterritorial, sex role-reversed shorebird, with male-only care, in Utqia_gvik, Alaska. We tested multiple predictions from the 'sperm storage' hypothesis. Extrapair paternity occurred in 11% (37/334) of the nests and 4% (42/1182) of the eggs were sired by a male other than the incubating parent. Although a female's initial mate occasionally sired offspring in her next clutch, our results suggest that sperm stored from a previous mate does not play a major role in explaining the occurrence of extrapair paternity in this sequentially polyandrous species. Instead, extrapair paternity was generally due to extrapair copulations by both sexes during the period between pair establishment and early incubation and to rapid mate switching by females in the context of attempts to acquire multiple care-giving males.

AB Global climate change is causing heatwaves to increase in number, length and intensity. These extreme temperatures can reduce fitness when mating behaviours are affected. An important mating behaviour for many organisms is sexual signalling. For example, songbirds, such as the zebra finch, Taeniopyggia guttata, use song to attract mates. Here, we test how an acute period of extreme heat affects song production in male zebra finches. We then ask whether female zebra finches discriminate between songs produced at different temperatures. We find that males significantly reduce song output at temperatures that induce heat dissipation behaviours. We also find that males produce song bouts with shorter syllables when thermally challenged. Furthermore, the relative acoustic and structural consistency of songs changes with temperature. Finally, we find that female zebra finches discriminate between songs produced at different temperatures, and the strength of discrimination is associated with changes in syllable duration. Altogether, we demonstrate that heatwave-like conditions can impact communication via alterations in signaller behaviour and the signal itself. We also discuss the potential compounding effects of reduced song production and other physiological declines on fitness in free-living zebra finches, which increasingly experience these high temperatures.

AB Foraging dives in birds and mammals involve complex physiological and behavioural adaptations to cope with the breaks in normal respiration. Optimal dive strategies should maximize the proportion of time spent under water actively foraging versus the time spent on the surface. Oxygen loading and carbon dioxide dumping carried out on the surface could involve recovery from the consequences of the last dive and/or preparation in anticipation of the next dive depth and duration. However, few studies have properly explored the causal pattern of effects within such dive cycles, which is crucial prior to any assessment of optimal dive strategies. Using time depth recorders and global positioning system loggers, we recorded over 42 000 dives by 39 pairs of male and female European shags, Phalacrocorax aristotelis. Dives either involved a straight descent and ascent, presumably reflecting an unsuccessful search for prey, or a descent followed by horizontal movement followed by an ascent, presumably reflecting active hunting pursuit of pelagic prey. Males were larger than females, but we were unable to distinguish between sex effects and the nonlinear effects of body mass on dive behaviour. Path analysis showed that within-individual dive-to-dive variation in surface times can best be explained as recovery from the previous dive. As expected in a pelagic hunter with unpredictable dive durations, there was no evidence of anticipatory preparation of oxygen stores in predive surface durations. Among-individual variation in dives showed that body mass directly affected descent durations, but individual variation in all other dive and surface durations was driven by variation in descent duration, suggesting a critical role for dive depth in overcoming body mass-dependent effects of hydrodynamic/wave drag and buoyancy. Our an-alyses test for the first time certain critical assumptions for studies assessing optimal dive strategies in birds and mammals, thereby revealing new details and avenues for research concerning adaptive diving behaviour.

AB Consistent interindividual differences in behaviour (i.e. personality) and intraindividual variability in behaviour (higher intraindividual variability means lower behavioural predictability) are common across animal taxa. However, how personality and behavioural predictability of males and females influence female mate choice and male-male competition remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated this in the jade jumping spider, Siler semiglaucus. After assessing the level of aggression (an individual's average aggression) and aggression predictability (the variability around average aggression within an individual) of both S. semiglaucus males and females, we performed female mate choice trials to test whether aggression and aggression predictability in females, males or both would affect female mate choice. We also conducted male contest trials to test whether male aggression or aggression predictability would influence the outcomes of male contests. We found that both females and males showed consistent interindividual differences in aggression, and aggressive spiders were more predictable than less aggressive ones. Despite a positive correlation between aggression and predictability, male aggression predicted female mate choice better than aggression predictability. Females showed a directional preference for aggressive males over docile males regardless of female aggression or male aggression predictability. Predictable aggressive males were also more likely to win contests. Our results suggest that both female mate choice and male-male competition favour males with high aggression, and thus total sexual selection that acts on male aggression may be reinforcing. These findings also highlight that male S. semiglaucus with a higher level of aggression may have better reproductive performance. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Wind is an understudied environmental variable capable of having profound impacts upon the foraging behaviour of flying organisms. We investigated the effects of wind and temperature on honey bees, Apis mellifera, foraging on two plant varieties, Lavandula x intermedia 'Grosso' and Origanum vulgare to determine how wind influences foraging behaviour and whether responses differ between the plant varieties. Fans and an artificial wind break were used to generate wind speeds from 0 to 3.5 m/s with the following behaviours examined in a minute of foraging: number of flower visits, handling time per flower, interflower flight duration and proportion of flowers walked to. Flower movement was quantified using video footage and imageJ tracking software. Bees visited significantly fewer flowers with increasing wind speed on both plant varieties, with an average decrease of 38% between the lowest and highest wind speeds. However, the reduction was significantly steeper when foraging on O. vulgare. The reduction was due to an increase in handling time on both varieties, with interflower flight duration unaffected. Temperature had no effect on flower visit rate for either plant variety. The only behaviour influenced by flower movement was handling time, which was found to increase with flower movement. However, this increase did not result in fewer flower visits. Our results support previous work on arti-ficial flowers which determined that the direct effect of wind on the bee influences foraging efficiency and behaviour more than the indirect effect of flower movement.

AB Carryover effects occur when an individual's experience during one stage of the annual cycle influences their behaviour in subsequent stages. This includes stages of the annual cycle, such as migration, when behaviour, such as departure timing, is also affected by circannual and circadian cues. In birds, the initiation of autumn migratory movements is often related to the timing of the cessation of the breeding season. However, less is known as to whether breeding season carryover effects also affect the pace of migration. To determine whether there are carryover effects from the breeding season to migration in barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, we monitored nests and used the Motus Wildlife Tracking System to determine migratory departure dates and the pace of migration. Barn swallows that finished breeding later in the summer initiated migration later and migrated faster through North America than swallows that finished breeding earlier in the summer. However, daily flight speeds were unrelated to the timing of the breeding season, suggesting that late-departing individuals increased their overall pace by reducing stopovers. Our results suggest that although barn swallows do not establish a nonbreeding territory, there are constraints during migration that require late-departing individuals to compensate for carryover effects from the breeding season. Late departure is not necessarily disadvantageous if individuals are able to 'catch-up' to early-departing individuals, but more work is needed to assess whether late departure and the faster pace of migration affect the subsequent survival of these individuals.

AB The transmission of many parasites, particularly those with complex life cycles, can only occur when infective stages that are present in one host are consumed by another host. Parasites can enhance rates of transmission by altering the behaviour, coloration or conspicuousness of infected hosts that require ingestion by a predator in which parasite reproduction occurs (i.e. the definitive host). But such enhancement will impose costs if it also facilitates the transmission of infective stages into nonhosts that are incompatible with parasite development and reproduction. We assessed these potential costs in fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, exposed to larvae of a brain-encysting trematode, Ornithodiplostomum ptychocheilus. We evaluated minnow antipredator escape responses immediately after they received visual stimuli from simulated host and nonhost predators. Our results show that mean response latencies of infected minnows were 12% greater than uninfected minnows when they were threatened with horizontally approaching stimuli (simulating a nonhost predator) regardless of infection level and regardless of parasite development stage. Response latencies of minnows exposed to vertically approaching stimuli (simulating a host predator) were lower than in controls, but the differences were not significant. In this case of parasite-induced alteration of host behaviour, the alteration enhances transmission into nonhosts. Costs associated with enhanced transmission into nonhosts likely constrains the development of specific parasite-induced alterations of host phenotypes in other host-parasite interactions that require predation of infected hosts.

AB Behaviours whose primary function is not signalling can convey information that other individuals can use to make relevant decisions. In cooperatively breeding vertebrates, feeding young that are not own offspring typically provides indirect fitness payoffs, but group members may also benefit directly by advertising their contribution to their social mates, to either increase their 'social prestige' or obtain a share of territory commodities ('pay to stay'). Evidence of such a signalling component of brood provisioning, however, remains controversial. In the cooperative society of carrion crows, Corvus corone, male subordinates have little chance of independent reproduction and do the best of a bad job by helping to raise the current brood. The value of future reproduction is instead higher for subordinate females, which, because they have better prospects of finding a breeding vacancy, generally invest less than males in helping at the nest. Under these circumstances, dominants are expected to be more vigilant over the contribution to brood provisioning by female subordinates, which in turn, might need to show their helpfulness to retain group membership. In accordance with this idea, we found that female retained offspring increased the 'visibility' of their contribution by provisioning in front of the dominant breeders significantly more than any other category of group members. In addition, retention of group membership for female offspring was associated with their perceived effort in chick feeding. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis of 'pay to stay' and suggest that a signalling component of helping can arise in a 'typical' kin-based cooperative society.

AB Environmental context is a crucial factor that influences sexual communication systems. Particularly in ectotherms, which cannot metabolically regulate their body temperature, temperature has an outsized effect on these intraspecific interactions. Using the desert-dwelling jumping spider Habronattus clypeatus, we assessed how temperature impacts various parts of the male signal and female mate choice for the signal. These spiders have multimodal, temporally structured courtship displays that begin with visual-only 'sidling' displays and proceed to multimodal visual and vibratory displays. To examine temperature effects, we performed sequential choice mating experiments (N = 45 trials) at two temperature treatments: hot (similar to 50 degrees C) and room temperature (similar to 25 degrees C). We found first that variation in the different stages of courtship segregated onto different principal components. The only aspect of male courtship that females expressed preference for was sidling courtship, but only at the higher temperature. Females also preferred to mate with heavier males at all temperatures. Specifically, females preferred to mate with males that performed shorter sidling displays. This is reflected by shorter copulation times in the warm treatment as well. We also found that temperature impacted only vibratory courtship and not sidling courtship. Our results highlight the importance of understanding environmental context in studies of animal communication. We also stress how a holistic, rather than reductive, approach to complex communication systems is vital in order to understand how selection acts upon them.

AB Animals move in 'modes' where movement patterns relate to specific behaviours. Despite much work on the movement of butterflies, their behavioural modes are relatively unexplored. Here we analysed the behaviour of the model butterfly species the meadow brown, Maniola jurtina. We identified modes in both sexes and across habitats varying in resource density. We found that, in nectar-rich habitats, males had more diverse behaviour than females, engaging in a unique 'high-flight' mode associated with mate search, whereas females were primarily nectaring or inactive. In nectar-poor habitats, both sexes were similar, switching between flight and inactivity. We also identified the movement parameters of the modes, finding that, for both sexes, movements associated with nectaring were slower and more tortuous and, for males, the mode associated with mate searching was straighter and faster. Using an individual-based random-walk model, we investigated the effects of behaviour on movement predictions by comparing a mode-switching model with a version including intraspecific variation and another assuming homogeneity between individuals. For both sexes, including modes affected the mean and shape of the displacement rate compared to models assuming homogeneity, although for females modes increased displacement 1.5 times while for males they decreased it by a third. Both models also differed substantially from models assuming intraspecific variation. Finally, using a new model of search behaviour we investigated the general conditions under which individuals should engage in an exclusive search for host plants or receptive females. Parameterized for M. jurtina, the model predicted males should engage exclusively in mate search, but females only when searching is very efficient. The model provides a framework for analysing the searching behaviour of other butterfly species. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of social network analysis to quantify animal social relationships has increased exponentially over the last two decades. A popular aspect of social network analysis is the use of individually based network metrics. Despite the diversity of social network metrics that exist and the large number of studies that generate network metrics, little guidance exists on the number and type of metrics that should be analysed in a single study. Here, we comment on the 'hypothesize after results are known' (HARKing) phenomenon in the context of social network analysis, a practice that we term 'metric hacking' and define as the use of statistical criteria to select which metrics to use rather than a priori choice based on a research hypothesis. We identify three situations where metric hacking can occur in studies quantifying social network metrics: (1) covariance among network metrics as explanatory variables in the same model; (2) covariance among network metrics as response variables in multiple models; and (3) covariance between response and explanatory variables in the same model. We outline several quantitative and qualitative issues associated with metric hacking, provide alternative options and guidance on the appropriate use of multiple network metrics to avoid metric hacking. By increasing awareness of the use of multiple social network metrics, we hope to encourage better practice for the selection and use of social network metrics in animal social network analysis. 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Territoriality is central to animal behaviourists' understanding of many facets of animal behaviour, including resource acquisition, space use behaviour, communication and mating systems. However, the term itself, how it is conceptualized and defined, has long been nebulous and contentious. Here, we ask whether juxtaposing debates about territoriality from animal behaviour with parallel discussions of territoriality from the social sciences can offer a historically and sociologically informed path out of the conceptual gridlock in which animal territoriality has been located for decades. We delineate two key problems with territoriality identified in the animal behaviour literature: First, that it focuses on how animals are expected to behave rather than how they actually behave and, second, that it assumes rather than demonstrates the function of, and specific relationships among, individuals. We then link these problems to social scientists' theorizations of the difference between property and access: whereas property is focused on how people are expected to behave under juridicalelegal rules governing resource use, access focuses on a wide array of means by which people actually access resources. We thus argue that longstanding problems with animal territoriality have arisen due to implicitly embedded notions of property and ownership. Our juxtaposition raises two further problems with territoriality: first, it unwarrantedly serves to attribute authority to individuals described as territory 'owners' and casts others ('intruders', 'sneakers') as transgressors and, second, conceiving of ownership is unfeasible in animal societies lacking the particular juridicalelegal institutions that establish and enforce property rights. Instead, we advocate for an access-based approach that will obviate these problems. Ultimately, we argue that the theory of access, as developed in social science literatures on spatial and relational resource use, will allow for a fuller and more nuanced understanding of variation in animal behaviour than that afforded by current dominant notions of territoriality.

AB In Drosophila serrata flies, there is female choice for male cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles and male choice for female CHC profiles. Furthermore, both males and females can alter their CHCs: when there is more opportunity for mating, males express combinations of CHCs preferred by females; however, females appear to change CHC profiles to avoid male harassment. In this study, I investigate the effect of number of matings (0-4) on male and female sexually selected CHCs. Mating caused males to express CHCs associated with higher male mating success. Thus, successfully mating males are likely to have increased future mating success. Conversely, females that mated more times expressed CHC profiles that were associated with lower female mating success. Females maximized their offspring production by mating more than once, but additional matings did not provide additional benefits. Furthermore, number of matings did not affect female survival. In total, these results suggest that females alter CHC expression to discourage male courtship when additional matings are not beneficial. In conclusion, plasticity in male and female CHC expression can both increase variance in male mating success and decrease variance in female mating success, driving the evolution of sexually selected chemical signals.

AB Disease exposure is a threat to all organisms, but there are a number of methods of self-defence. First, individuals can proactively prevent disease through avoidance behaviours. If they become infected, individuals can activate an immune response to control the infection. A trade-off between avoidance behaviours and immune response activation has been hypothesized to occur because of costs associated with each strategy. Individuals may balance behavioural and immunological strategies to provide optimal protection against disease. To test this hypothesis in a captive population of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, we conducted behavioural trials to determine how much time focal birds associated with stimulus birds that were either healthy or displayed sickness behaviours. We then inoculated focal birds with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and measured levels of natural antibodies, complement and haptoglobin. One physiological mechanism that may mediate the proposed trade-off between behavioural and immunological defences is the glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone (CORT). Therefore, we experimentally manipulated CORT in another subset of birds. Finally, it is unknown whether individuals are consistent in their strategy choice over time or whether strategy choice changes based on environmental context or life history stage. Thus, we tested behavioural and immunological responses multiple times. We found limited evidence that zebra finches trade off between behavioural avoidance and immune responses as protection against infection, instead these defences were unrelated or positively correlated in control birds. CORT changed the relationships between behavioural and immunological defences and these defences were traded-off after acute CORT exposure. Some behavioural and immunological defences were repeatable over three months. Thus, even though individuals may be consistent in behavioural and immunological defence strategies, these defences are not generally traded off. Further research is encouraged to determine whether behavioural and immunological trade-offs persist across contexts, life history stages, or in wild populations, and the degree to which strategies are influenced by selection.

AB The development of reproductive isolation is a crucial step in the speciation process. Premating isolation is often implicated in traditional models of divergence with gene flow, but the evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms has been poorly explored in species resulting from hybrid speciation. We investigated the mechanisms of reproductive isolation between two closely related Adriatic pipefish species, Syngnathus taenionotus and Syngnathus typhle, that show a complex genetic history consistent with introgressive hybridization. We studied the genetic mating system of S. taenionotus in situ, quantified differences in the reproductive behaviour of the two species and carried out a series of behavioural experiments aimed at identifying the factors responsible for the maintenance of species integrity in natural populations. We identified subtle differences in courtship behaviour between the two species and evidence of a preference for large mating partners in reproductive males of both species. Individual preferences were equivocal in conspecific-heterospecific preference trials, and S. typhle males were the only group that showed a significant preference for conspecifics. Reciprocal no-choice mating experiments resulted in a low frequency of heterospecific matings between S. typhle males and S. taenionotus females, all of which failed to produce viable offspring, indicating the presence of both strong premating and postmating isolation in this system. Our results suggest that the development of reproductive isolating mechanisms between species produced by homoploid hybridization may differ from that expected under standard models of divergence with gene flow.

AB Signals of resource-holding potential in dyadic (one-on-one) contests are relatively straightforward, typically reflected in the attributes of the individual, including body size and resource ownership. However, conveying this information is considerably more complex in social species: the outcome of collective contests will be influenced by both individual and group level effects, and the signal must be subsequently transmitted to the colony in order to elicit a colony response. Australian meat ants engage in collective displays where aggregations of many hundreds of pairs of workers from neighbouring colonies antennate one another while adopting a tip-toe posture with the abdomen raised. These displays rarely escalate into physical contests with their typically fatal consequences. A display between two workers may cease by one worker leaving or if one displaying worker is replaced by a nestmate. We asked whether these collective displays act to convey reliable information about relative colony size. Our field experiments and observations reveal that these displays do not necessarily convey precise information about relative colony size, and that it is possible for colonies to signal an exaggerated colony size, at least in the short term.

AB The experience of traumatic events can catalyse physiological trade-offs that increase the vulnerability of organisms to disease and death. Among potential sources of trauma, the arrival of new males in female-philopatric species may be particularly salient due to the accompanying threat of infanticide. In such social systems, the killing of dependent offspring benefits these new males by accelerating females' return to receptivity. Despite widespread interest in the evolutionary drivers of infanticide, there is little known about the collateral effects of male immigration on other group members. That is, do the periods following male immigration act as 'windows of adversity' that carry costs for group members over and above the direct victims of infanticide? Here, we examined how the immediate aftermath of new male immigration in a female-philopatric species (Theropithecus gelada) was related to the risk of injury for all individuals. Analysing 139 injuries and 41 male immigration events across 9 years of data collection, we found that male immigration was accompanied by increases in injury risk for all natal individuals (adult males were excluded from the analysis), with the most severe effects for dependent infants and lactating females. Females with injuries had longer interbirth intervals, highlighting the reproductive consequences of injury. This study is among the first to quantify costs associated with male immigration beyond infant mortality and highlights that these periods can act as windows of adversity that may affect lifetime health and fitness outcomes.

AB The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is the most polymorphic region of the vertebrate genome. Individuals with more MHC alleles can respond to a broader suite of pathogens, suggesting that selection should favour the ability to assess the MHC genotype of potential mates. Indeed, MHC-based mate choice, particularly preferences for MHC-dissimilar or MHC-diverse partners, appears widespread among vertebrates. Mammals, fish and seabirds assess MHC through odour cues. However, despite the prominence of songbirds in mate choice studies, the mechanisms by which this group might assess MHC remain speculative. Motivated by the discovery that chemical similarity in the preen oil of song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, predicts similarity at MHC class II, we examined preen oil odour preferences for MHC dissimilarity and diversity. We presented breeding-condition song sparrows with preen oil from opposite-sex conspecifics using a two-choice design. We compared time spent with odour from MHC-dissimilar versus MHC-similar birds, and MHC-diverse versus less MHC-diverse birds. Both sexes spent more time with odour from MHC-dissimilar compared to MHC-similar birds and with odour from more MHC-diverse than less MHC-diverse birds. We conclude that song sparrows, and presumably other passerines, can use preen oil odour to discriminate MHC similarity and diversity of potential mates.

AB social insects, the colony itself is a complex system composed of dozens to millions of essentially autonomous workers. Studying the behaviour of these workers in response to experimental disturbance provides insight into the mechanisms by which colonies, and complex systems in general, can achieve flexibility. Here, we explore dynamic task allocation within colonies of Temnothorax rugatulus ants by separately increasing the demand for three different types of work: nest maintenance, brood care and foraging. We investigate (1) whether colonies respond to dynamic task demand and the timeline of their responses, (2) whether the colony achieves this flexibility by recruiting new workers to these tasks or modulating individual worker effort and (3) the rules by which individual workers switch tasks. We found that T. rugatulus ants are responsive to colony perturbation, yet the means by which they achieve this flexibility are task dependent, as is the time it takes them to respond. Flexibility is achieved both by the increased effort of already active workers and the recruitment of new workers to the focal task. We suggest that newly recruited workers may come from task-specific reserve pools of unemployed workers: roaming 'walkers' appear to be a generalized reserve force for most tasks except for brood care, while previously inactive workers might act as a specialized reserve pool for brood care and be prompted to engage in this task when they locally encounter brood.

AB The study of animal behaviour contributes to our understanding of how individuals or populations live and survive. To this purpose researchers often manipulate, in a broad sense, wild animals in sensitive periods, such as breeding, when animals are accessible/available. Few studies, however, show the impact of these manipulations on the survival of individuals. In this study we measured short- and long-term impacts of experimental manipulations on a small colony of blue petrels at Kerguelen archipelago where behavioural studies have been performed since 2006. We developed two models to measure potential impacts of manipulation: (1) a new multievent model that allowed us to account for different severity classes of experimental manipulation independently and (2) a model that allowed us to consider the cumulative impact over several years of these experimental manipulations. We found no evidence that our experimental manipulations have negatively affected survival or breeding probabilities either in the short or in the long term. Conversely, similarly to other capture-recapture studies on blue petrels, survival was shown to be dependent on the birds' experience (birds that probably bred for the first time versus birds that had already bred several times before) and the breeding probability to be dependent on the year, possibly because of environmental conditions.

AB Behavioural traits are thought to be important determinants of the resilience of animal species to a rapidly changing global climate. Although increasing temperature has taken centre stage in the debate over climate change, animals will have to survive more than just extreme heat to persist in the Anthropocene. The aim of this review is to stimulate interest in the opportunities for integrative and applied behavioural study of how animals can survive life-threatening weather events, in order to help achieve the societal goal of maintaining viable wildlife populations under future climate scenarios. First, using the thermoregulatory behaviour of a hypothetical ground squirrel species as an example, we explore how different scenarios of behavioural flexibility, plasticity, adaptation, exaptation and management action can lead to population persistence or extinction. Next, we propose that considering weather events such as heatwaves, storms and floods, wildfire and drought as selective pressures worthy of investigation provides a new research framework for climate-related conservation behaviour. In our review we provide examples of the responses of animals to different types of weather extremes and describe behavioural adaptations to environments with extreme climates. We give methodological recommendations to jump start climate change research by behaviourists. Finally, we conclude with suggestions for using citizen science and a public video repository to foster evidence-based decision making for managing habitats and prioritizing species conservation efforts in light of the threats to biodiversity posed by climate change.

AB Aggregation of territorial individuals within a species can be facilitated via conspecific signals, wherein settlement implies habitat suitability, ease of resource acquisition and/or increased predator detection. The black-tailed prairie dog is a colonial small mammal with alarm vocalizations that confer benefits via group vigilance against predators and increased foraging time. Although prairie dog alarm calls are relatively well understood, the information embedded in their jump-yip call, which includes both a distinct cry and a bodily gesture, remains less clear. We evaluated prairie dog behaviour in response to conspecific acoustic signals using playbacks of alarm and jump-yip calls at 26 sites in northeastern Wyoming, U.S.A. Recorded calls from an isolated colony were broadcast to a mean of five individuals per site, and behavioural responses were compared against uninfluenced behaviour and a control playback of ambient sounds. The alarm playback caused prairie dogs to increase vigilance 122% and decrease foraging time 23%, demonstrating prairie dogs will shift behaviour based on signals from individuals of an unfamiliar colony. However, the alarm call playback reduced frequency of the jump-yip behaviour only at colonies nearest the recording source. The jump-yip playback caused unfamiliar prairie dogs to display 339% more jump-yips than uninfluenced behaviour. The jump-yip playback did not alter recipients' foraging or vigilance behaviours relative to control treatments, suggesting that although prairie dogs can understand and reciprocate an unfamiliar, single modality signal, they may not shift other behaviours based on this stimulus. As such, the purpose and benefits of the jump-yip call remain unclear. Playback efficacy also had a nonlinear relationship with distance from recording source. Our work improves understanding of communication at the metapopulation level, examines the potential role of the jump-yip and provides insights for how conspecific signals might be used as a management tool.

AB There is increasing evidence that among-individual differences in behaviour are, in part, generated by environmental effects. For example, diet quality can have drastically different effects on behavioural variation depending on whether it acts primarily during ontogeny (i.e. as a permanent environmental effect) or has an immediate effect on trait expression as a consequence of energy intake (i.e. temporary source of variation). Moreover, whether diet quality has a stronger effect on a trait's average expression, its variance or its covariance with other traits, remains unclear. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design crossing life stage (juvenile and adult) and diet quality (low- or high-energy content) to disentangle the effects of developmental and adult diets on the expression of behavioural differences. We tested 281 crickets for their activity levels, responses to predator cues and body mass. Neither developmental diet nor adulthood diet had any effect on population means or on the expression of an activity-antipredator response syndrome, suggesting a genetic basis for this syndrome. We did find evidence for increases in the within-individual variance as a result of exposure to a high-quality diet. However, these increases were only found for antipredator response and body mass. This indicates that diets with higher energy content can increase the potential for behavioural plasticity in antipredator response. In addition to changes in within-individual variation in behaviour, diet quality during development also mediated the links between maturation time and exploratory behaviours. More exploratory crickets matured faster when exposed to the low-quality developmental diet, but this relation was absent in the high-quality diet treatment. Our results show that changes in developmental diet quality can mediate the relationship between life history and behavioural traits later in life.

AB Theoretical treatments of the evolution of learning have a long and rich history, and although many aspects remain unresolved, the consensus is that the predictability and timescale of environmental change play a crucial role in when learning evolves. Directly testing these ideas has proven difficult because comparative experiments must assume many often unknowable aspects of an evolutionary past. Even within the present, identifying and accurately quantifying the relevant types of change can be problematic. Controlling or manipulating change can be difficult in many taxa. Within the theory, what is meant by change can markedly vary between models. Here, we present a targeted comparison of models to show this variation, and argue that standardizing measures of change can add tractability to models. We first review how change is emphasized in models of learning evolution and then describe the still small literature that directly tests the evolution of learning via digital evolution and experimental evolution. We then give an example of how to tie specific natural history to larger theory on learning evolution using the flag model of reliability and certainty and foraging in bumblebees. Learning, by its nature, is of fundamental importance to many fields. Theoretical treatments of learning evolution have been growing at a rapid pace, often with limited empirical applicability to natural systems and little congruence on what is meant by change across models. By explicitly defining change and tying models to natural systems, we can greatly increase our ability to not only understand when learning should evolve, but also when learning does evolve.

AB Trilled vocalizations, wherein notes are repeated in rapid succession, are found in a variety of taxa including oscine birds, singing mice and nonhuman primates. Previous work on birds and singing mice has provided evidence of vocal performance constraints in trills, where there is a trade-off between the rate of the note repetition and the bandwidth (or frequency range) of each note. Here, we investigate vocal performance constraints in the trilled portion of the female contribution to the duet in the Bornean gibbon, Hylobates muelleri, recorded from seven sites in Sabah, Malaysia. We used two approaches. First, to ensure that our results were comparable with previous studies on vocal performance constraints, we used a 90% quantile regression to examine the relationship between trill rate and bandwidth. We found that there was a significant negative correlation between bandwidth and trill rate. Second, we formally compared multiple hierarchical models to identify the best predictors of bandwidth and trill rate. Our top model predicting bandwidth showed that trill rate and location within the trill were reliable predictors of bandwidth. With trill rate as the response variable, our top model included location within the trill as well as trill duration. We found that there were no important site-level differences in bandwidth but that trill rate varied predictably among sites. Our analyses provide strong evidence for performance constraints in the production of trills in Bornean gibbon females. Further research is needed to determine whether higher-performance trills provide honest signals of caller quality and whether gibbons respond differently to low- and high-performance calls.

AB Collective movement decisions are often based on personal and conspecific knowledge. In fission-fusion animal societies, individuals rarely have the same level of information about their environment, with knowledge being a reflection of past individual and collective decisions. Knowledge of the environment is particularly essential in heterogeneous landscapes, where resources may vary in space and time. Indeed, landscape heterogeneity, a product of the quantity and configuration of resources as well as predators and competitors, is the basis of both individual and collective movement decisions. We assessed individual movement decisions of an alpine ungulate as a function of landscape knowledge and landscape heterogeneity. We hypothesized that individuals would base their decisions on previous information in areas they know well, especially in highly heterogeneous landscapes. These individual decisions would have consequences for the collective movement decisions of groups. To test this hypothesis, we used GPS collars to monitor the movements of -45% of the individuals (N = 28) of a small population of woodland caribou, Rangifer tarandus caribou, between 2013 and 2016. We assessed the fission probability of caribou dyads (N = 3681, from 172 dyad combinations) in relation to landscape knowledge, landscape heterogeneity and social bonds between dyad members. The probability of group fission was influenced by the interaction between the variables describing landscape knowledge of dyadic members and social bonds. The probability of group fission and the influence of habitat or social bonds on fission probability increased with landscape knowledge. In familiar landscapes, individuals were more likely to stay with conspecifics if they shared a strong social bond or if they were in preferential habitat. Such fine adjustments in movement and social decisions demonstrated the importance of the information held by conspecifics when occupying unfamiliar areas. By staying with conspecifics, individuals could gain access to high-quality resources without the energetic cost of locating such resources.

AB Three-way interactions consisting of a female and her current and previous mates have been studied intensively in the context of sperm competition involving male manipulation of female remating rate but have rarely been documented in a broader context involving classical premating male display and stimulatory traits such as courtship behaviour. This is surprising because premating traits influence the intensity of postmating competition, which occurs only when a mated female consecutively accepts another male. In Drosophila fruit flies, the subsequent male has an advantage over the previous male in sperm competition. However, the ejaculate of the previous male changes the female's behaviour to refuse remating for several days (remating suppression), reducing the potential advantage of the subsequent male. Under such conditions, the evolution of any means that counteract remating suppression is thought to be adaptive for the subsequent male. Males of the fruit fly Drosophila prolongata perform a unique courtship behaviour called 'leg vibration'. Although leg vibration increases female receptivity, it is not always required for mating with virgin females, raising a question of why it evolved in the first place. In this study, the role of leg vibration in remating was examined, using leg amputation to manipulate the efficiency of leg vibration and an eye colour mutation to detect remating events. Leg vibration had a profound effect on mated females: the remating rate was extremely low with leg-amputated males, indicating that leg vibration was almost indispensable for remating of recently mated females. Our results demonstrated that single courtship behaviour has different levels of importance or necessity for the first male and the subsequent males, providing an example of the evolution of courtship behaviour that was possibly driven by postmating competition.

AB Song development research has been dominated by studies of northern hemisphere species where typically only males sing. However, female song is present in many species and recent research shows that female song is in fact the ancestral trait for songbirds. Here we present results from a field-based cross-sectional study comparing song development in both sexes of New Zealand bellbirds, Anthornis melanura. We asked whether both sexes develop song at a similar rate, and how the components of a song differ with age. The motor phases of each sex began at similar ages, with subsong starting at 3 weeks posthatching and song types crystallizing by 24 weeks. Song components were compared between three age groups: learning phase, first breeding season and adults. Song structure and acoustic properties were similar between sexes within the learning phase (except for mean fundamental frequency) but differed in adults. The variety of syllable types produced was more widespread in the learning phase and differed significantly between age groups and sexes. Individual syllable production varied in consistency between age groups for both sexes and we suggest that more complex syllables may require more practice to develop to maturity. The findings support the consensus that female and male bellbirds learn song at similar rates; however, differences between the sexes in the learned song components result in sexually dimorphic songs. This study is novel in that we used a field-based approach in which the complex song of male and female wild birds was compared between age groups ranging from fledging to adulthood. Our study contributes to current knowledge of female song development, a topic important for further understanding the selection pressures driving song evolution in songbirds.

AB The selection of suitable locations to fulfil life history requisites is an important process that can influence the survival and development of individuals and the persistence of populations. The impacts of site selection are well documented across taxa, but the driving forces behind site selection, especially regarding transgenerational behaviour, are less well understood. Philopatry (the tendency for an individual to remain near its natal home range) and maternal effect (a nongenetic transfer of phenotypes from mother to offspring) are two factors often thought to influence birth site selection behaviours. We investigated black bear, Ursus americanus, transgenerational den type selection behaviour by analysing a long-term data set containing den selection data of 168 2-year-old subadult females during 1984-2013 at four study sites in Maine, U.S.A. to determine whether there is evidence of philopatry and maternal effect on den type selection. Using logistic regression and model selection, we found evidence that both mechanisms play a role in subadult den type selection. Bears that spent the last winter with their mother in a high-protection den were more likely to select that den type as a subadult. Furthermore, in instances of differences in transgenerational den type selection, most subadults (79%) transitioned from a yearling den of lower protection to a subadult den of higher protection. Transitional behaviour might indicate that subadult black bears also account for environmental plasticity and mediate their den selection accordingly, without the benefit of prior independent denning experience. Future research should evaluate the relationship between den type and offspring recruitment to examine whether an individual-level maternal effect is manifested at the population level. Our results suggest that behavioural maternal effects, in part, influence transgenerational den type selection in black bears, and by extension may influence the behavioural phenotypes of other species with extended periods of maternal care.

AB Primates spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other. Grooming is regularly found to be traded reciprocally (for grooming) or for rank-related benefits in the presence of food competition. It has been suggested that if food sources are clustered and monopolizable, then lower-ranked individuals will groom higher-ranked ones in order to be tolerated on food patches. This leads to grooming being directed up the hierarchy. However, the conditions where this is expected to occur are based on verbal reasoning alone, and no quantitative analysis of the conditions favouring grooming up the hierarchy appear in the literature. Here, we develop a quantitative model investigating when food competition can result in grooming up the hierarchy. Individuals are assumed to take actions pertaining to whom to groom, where to feed and whom to tolerate on food patches. By allowing individuals to choose actions according to reinforcement learning, we delineate conditions where groups of individuals will express reciprocal grooming and grooming up the hierarchy depending on environmental conditions (e.g. quality, number of food patches). In particular, we show that conditions of intense food competition may lead to less grooming up the hierarchy. The predictions of our model could guide future comparative studies and meta-analyses investigating social relationships in primates. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Hypotheses on the discrimination and recognition of predators by prey are divided as to whether the prey species' ability to recognize and avoid predators is proportionate to the duration of evolutionary exposure to specific predators or is a result of more generalized discrimination processes. Moreover, understanding of the timeframes necessary for prey species to maintain or acquire appropriate responses to introduced predators is poorly understood. We studied a population of wild, ontogenetically predator naive greater bilbies, Macrotis lagotis, living within a large (60 km(2)) predator-free exclosure, to determine whether they modified their burrow-emergence behaviour in response to olfactory stimuli from introduced predators, dogs, Canis familiaris, and cats, Felis catus. Greater bilbies have shared over 3000 years of coevolutionary history with dogs but less than 200 years with cats. Bilbies spent more time only partially emerged (with at most head and shoulders out) as opposed to fully emerged (standing quad-rupedally or bipedally) from their burrows when dog faeces were present, in comparison to faeces of cats, rabbits and an unscented control. Our results were consistent with the 'ghosts of predator past' hypothesis, which postulates that prey species' abilities to respond to the odours of predators scales with their period of coexistence.

AB Understanding animal movements is a key prerequisite for deciphering ecological processes such as population dynamics, community structure or biological invasions. Many animals restrict their movements to certain areas (home ranges) by alternating visits among several suitable sites. The dynamics of these recursive movements are assumed to be primarily driven by food availability and predation risk. In contrast, environmental parasite pressures have rarely been considered as possible drivers of animals' ranging patterns. In this article, we present evidence that environmentally transmitted gastrointestinal parasites may shape recursive movement patterns of a group of free-ranging mandrills, Mandrillus sphinx. These rainforest-dwelling primates returned less frequently and after longer time lags to sites, including sleeping sites, they had contaminated than to sites with low contamination levels. This pattern was especially pronounced during the dry season, when contamination risk was highest. In contrast, rainfall shortened the time between visits, consistent with the hypothesis that rainfall may wash away parasites, allowing a more rapid return to previously used sites. Although resource distribution and predator threat could not be ruled out in this study, we suggest that the risk of acquiring environmentally transmitted parasites is possibly another factor influencing animal ranging patterns as well as habitat selection or species distribution. Consequently, parasites and their distribution in the environment, as well as the possible antiparasite strategy we document here, should be targets for future research on animal movement.

AB Many species use low-amplitude (soft) song during close range interactions with conspecifics, such as in aggressive encounters or courtship displays. It has been suggested that soft song is adapted to limit eavesdropping by conspecifics or predators through reduced signal transmission range. If so, other structural features of soft song, besides amplitude, should be adapted to reduce transmission. The soft songs of white-throated thrushes, Turdus assimilis, have properties expected to lower transmission, such as higher frequency and broader bandwidth relative to broadcast songs. We compared the transmission properties of broadcast and soft syllables using a sound propagation field experiment. When played at the same amplitude as broadcast song, soft song showed greater excess attenuation and blur ratios and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Lowering the frequency of soft syllables recovered similar transmission properties as those of broadcast syllables. Further analysis of spectral traits showed that excess attenuation values were mainly affected by minimum frequency and peak frequency, while blur ratio variation was predominantly affected by bandwidth, and signal-to-noise ratios were predicted by bandwidth and peak frequency. Additionally, soft song had more frequency overlap with background noise than broadcast song. These results support the eavesdropping hypothesis: aspects of the acoustic structure of soft signals in addition to low amplitude seem to have been shaped by selection to reduce transmission and avoid eavesdroppers.

AB Interactions between conspecifics early in life have the potential to shape phenotypic differences between individuals. These changes in phenotype may subsequently be passed to future offspring, something that has been studied in live-bearing mammals where there is often an element of parental care. The present study considers the transgenerational effects of social environment in zebrafish, Danio rerio, an egg-laying animal that shows no parental care, thus removing any influence of parental interaction and allowing the effects of conspecific interaction to be clearly determined. Zebrafish (F-0) were reared from fertilization to reproduction in three different social treatments: isolation, groups of 30 or groups of 100. At 28 days post fertilization, individuals were tested for anxiety and activity and at 3 months old for aggression. These F-0 fish were raised to sexual maturity and bred within their treatment group. The F-1 generation were then raised in groups of 30, irrespective of parental social environment and were assessed for behaviour in the same way as their parents. Social isolation increased anxiety and decreased aggression in the F-0 fish compared to those raised in social groups of 100. F-0 fish raised in social groups of 30 showed an intermediate response. Differences in anxiety were not passed to the F-1 generation; however, offspring of socially isolated fish were less aggressive than offspring of parents from social groups of 30 and 100. The social environment that an individual experienced from fertilization to reproduction affected their own behaviour and the behaviour of their offspring.

AB Human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC) disproportionately affects species with specialist traits and long generation times. By circumventing prolonged evolutionary processes, behavioural plasticity is critical in allowing species to cope with rapid environmental changes within their lifetimes. Coral reefs have faced multiple mass mortality events of corals related to climate change in the last two decades. The consequent loss of structural complexity adversely impacts long-lived, structure-dependent fish predators. We attempted to determine how well a guild of groupers (Pisces: Epinephelidae) copes with rapid structural change in the lightly fished Lakshadweep Archipelago, Indian Ocean. Of the 15 species, territorial and site-attached groupers declined exponentially with decreasing structural complexity, while widely ranging species showed no change. However, one site-attached species, the peacock grouper, Cephalopholis argus, maintained high densities across the structural gradient. We explored the mechanisms this species employs to cope with declining habitat structure. Our observations indicate that both a potential release from specialist competitors and plasticity in foraging behaviour (foraging territory size, diet and foraging mode) appeared to favour the peacock grouper's survival in sites of high and low structure. While specialist competitors dropped out of the assemblage, the foraging territory size of peacock groupers increased exponentially with structural decline, but remained constant and compact (50 m(2)) above a threshold of structural complexity (corresponding to a canopy height of 60 cm). Interestingly, despite significant differences in prey density in sites of high and low structure, gut content and stable isotope analyses indicated that peacock groupers maintained a specialized dietary niche. In-water behavioural observations suggested that diet specialization was maintained by switching foraging modes from a structure-dependent 'ambush' to a structure-independent 'widely foraging' mode. The remarkable foraging plasticity of species such as the peacock grouper will become increasingly critical in separating winners from losers and may help preserve specialist ecosystem functions as habitats collapse as a result of climate change.

AB When deciding to mate, it is assumed that females choose males bearing genes that will improve the genetic quality of their offspring, which is affected by both additive and nonadditive genetic variation. In this context, a 'compatible genes' model has been put forward to explain female mating decisions. According to this model, females are assumed to increase the genetic quality of their offspring by choosing mates on the basis of interactions between maternal and paternal genomes. Yet, this model is mainly supported by empirical data in endotherm vertebrates. Few studies have investigated this issue in terrestrial ectotherms like amphibians. These organisms often live in spatially structured populations characterized by small subpopulations and a high degree of philopatry, leading to striking reduction in gene flow, high genetic drift and relatively high inbreeding levels. In such a situation, one might expect that natural selection should favour mating tactics limiting the risk of inbreeding depression. In this paper, using an experimental approach controlling for the reproductive state of males, we examined how genetic compatibility may affect mating behaviour in an anuran, the yellow-bellied toad, Bombina variegata. First, our analyses confirmed a high degree of inbreeding in the studied population. Yet, we did not find any mating tactic that reduced the risk of inbreeding depression. Contrary to our expectations, males more closely related to the female had the higher mating success. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of these results.

AB Collective action problems arise when two or more individuals can free ride on one another's efforts when investing jointly in a common good. Many collective action tasks in nature, such as parental care, require multiple stages of investments to complete a task, but how the costs of consecutive periods of investment and the excludability and diminishability of a collective good influence investment strategy remains poorly understood. Here, we first developed an evolutionary game-theoretical model to explore the theoretical consequences of sequential investment strategies in collective good problems. We then investigated cooperative parental care during both incubation and provisioning stages in the jointnesting Taiwan yuhina, Yuhina brunneiceps, to test the key theoretical predictions of the model. We found that yuhina females that laid eggs earlier than other females invested more than they did in incubation (the first stage in the collective action problem). Intriguingly, but as predicted by our model, females that laid eggs earlier brought less food to nestlings in the joint brood during the nestling provisioning stage (the second stage in the collective action problem). This seemingly puzzling pattern can be explained by the fact that females that laid eggs earlier started incubation earlier and continued incubating eggs, which led to their offspring hatching earlier and being competitively superior (obtaining more food) at the nestling provisioning stage. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the complex nature of investment strategies parsed over different development stages in collective action problems.

AB The evolution of sibling competition is promoted when the brood's demand for resources (brood size) exceeds the parents' supply of resources (resource availability). However, little is known about the joint effects of brood size and resource availability and whether these effects are independent of each other. We conducted a study on the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, in which we manipulated both brood size and resource availability. We manipulated brood size by providing parents with 5, 10 or 20 larvae and resource availability by providing parents with a 5, 10 or 20 g mouse carcass. We found that resource availability had positive effects on parental care, larval body mass and larval survival, while brood size had a negative effect on larval body mass and larval survival. There were positive effects of the interaction between brood size and resource availability on larval begging and larval body mass, suggesting that the slopes describing the effect of brood size on larval begging and larval body mass became less negative as carcass size increased. When we repeated the analysis using larval density (i.e. brood size/resource availability) as a proxy for the shortage of resources, there were negative effects on parental care, larval body mass and larval survival. Our results have important implications by showing that there were main effects of both brood size and resource availability, and that their effects were not always independent of each other. Thus, treating brood size and resource availability as independent factors is preferential to using offspring density. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The face is an important cue for discriminating conspecifics in some primates (including humans), other mammals and birds. Although there is considerable evidence that fish can discriminate between conspecifics based on familiarity, the actual traits used to do so remain unclear. However, recent studies showed that two cichlid species used face colour patterns similarly to other vertebrates, and have suggested that social signals have evolved around the eyes, even in fish (face-specific hypothesis). In this study, we tested whether the striped, rock-dwelling Tanganyikan cichlid Julidochromis transcriptus can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics using facial patterns alone. We used a monitor to present fish with four digital models of combinations of facial and body patterns from familiar and unfamiliar fish. Focal fish spent more time near the monitor when presented with unfamiliar face models regardless of the body pattern. Therefore, we concluded that J. transcriptus recognizes familiar conspecifics using facial patterns alone, despite having distinct stripe patterns on the whole body. Our results are consistent with the face-specific hypothesis and indicate that social signals have evolved around the eyes of fish. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although growing neural evidence suggests that human and nonhuman primates share a similar face-processing mechanism, evidence from behavioural research has been mixed. If primates share a similar face-processing system, one would expect to observe similar behavioural effects in both human and nonhuman primates. A particularly robust effect observed in humans is the familiarity effect; humans are better able to recognize familiar as opposed to unfamiliar individuals. Here, we used a matching-to-sample paradigm to examine capuchin monkeys' ability to discriminate conspecific faces across three degrees of familiarity: individuals living in one's own social group ('in-group'), individuals living in one's neighbouring group ('out-group') and completely unfamiliar individuals ('unfamiliar'). We hypothesized that if capuchins utilize their knowledge of familiar individuals to help them discriminate photos of conspecific faces, then performance on the recognition task would increase with the familiarity of the individual. Capuchins were better able to individuate familiar in-group members and familiar out-group members compared to unfamiliar individuals, suggesting that familiarity affects capuchins' ability to discriminate conspecific faces, as it does that of humans and apes. However, there was no significant difference between in-group members and out-group members, suggesting that the concept of 'familiarity' may extend to individuals living in neighbouring groups that one interacts with regularly. This would be a fitness advantage for social species, like capuchins, which compete with neighbouring groups over access to food and mates. It may be an advantage for males in particular as they emigrate to neighbouring groups when they reach maturity. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is no proverbial silver bullet for mitigating human-wildlife conflict, but the study of animal behaviour is foundational to solving issues of coexistence between people and wild animals. Our purpose is to examine the theoretical and applied role that behavioural principles play in understanding and mitigating human-wildlife conflict, and delineate gaps in behavioural theory relative to mitigating these conflicts. Specifically, we consider two different, yet contemporary, examples of human-wildlife conflict: animal-vehicle collisions and carnivore depredation of livestock. Although ostensibly unrelated, both conflict areas share common themes relative to animal behavioural responses to disturbance and perception of risk. We first place the effects on wildlife due to these conflicts in the scope of population sustainability, and then examine current research relative to the following three questions. How is behavioural ecology relevant to these particular areas of conflict? Are advances toward understanding the mechanisms by which animals process information and make decisions being translated into management methods? How might management efforts be affected over time by individual behaviours, method integration and habituation/sensitization? Regarding animal-vehicle collisions, only in the last decade have researchers applied an antipredator theoretical framework with sensory ecology to understand aspects of marine mammal, terrestrial mammal and bird responses to vehicle approach, speed and associated stimuli. However, the size and speeds of modern vehicles demand that we improve economic models and possibly develop novel theoretical frameworks to better predict animal responses to vehicle approach. Within the context of carnivore-livestock depredation, our understanding of individual predator behaviour relative to perceived risk and factors contributing to the development of problem individuals will influence the efficacy of the most promising, nonlethal management approaches (e.g. distractive techniques, reproductive inhibition and olfactory barriers). In both cases, successful management is contingent upon a mechanistic understanding of how animals respond to disturbance and the information utilized to assess risk.

AB While parasites are fundamental components of ecological systems, emerging infectious diseases are a growing concern for conservation and management. Understanding the drivers and consequences of disease emergence in natural systems is complex because of the diverse array of factors associated with disease dynamics. Host behaviour plays an important role in disease dynamics across multiple scales (individuals to landscapes). Here, we synthesize our current understanding of the interplay between behaviour and disease in the context of conservation. We review the general importance of behaviour for determining the probability of exposure to parasites and the likelihood of infection once exposed. We also discuss the influence of infection on behaviours that affect disease transmission in populations and the potential trait-mediated indirect interactions that can influence disease risk within communities. Furthermore, we present several case studies demonstrating how the incorporation of behaviour into conservation and management strategies is critical for understanding emerging infectious diseases. Given the fundamental relationships between behaviour and infectious disease, there is a need for the development of practical methods for integrating this knowledge into conservation. Establishing a dialogue and forming collaborations between scientists and wildlife managers across multiple scales is an essential step. Ultimately, conservation practices that integrate knowledge of behaviour and infectious diseases will have a greater chance of success. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In social species, groups of individuals that live, forage or interact with each other often form a linear dominance hierarchy. Dominant individuals are thought to have greater access to resources and the ability to obtain higher-quality territories or mates, making dominance rank important to maximizing fitness. Social animals are often susceptible to infections from parasites or pathogens, and the energetic cost of mounting an immune response, along with displaying sickness behaviours, could affect an individual's social relationships. If a dominant individual becomes sick and is made vulnerable to challenges from lower-ranking group members, a loss in rank could be detrimental. Many songbirds, such as the black-capped chickadee, Poecile atricapillus, form seasonal social flocks during the winter, then divide into pairs for breeding during the spring. Our study used captive chickadees to determine whether a challenge to the immune system affects social dominance behaviour and status in the winter flock. In captive experimental flocks, top-ranked individuals were given an immune challenge in the form of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, and dominance behaviour was observed to determine whether status was altered. LPS-injected individuals lost a significant amount of weight and increased feeding rate when compared to control-injected birds, indicating an energetic cost, but they showed no change in dominance behaviour or loss of rank. These findings suggest that maintaining rank by continuing to invest in dominance behaviours is important in order to retain the fitness benefits associated with a high dominance rank.

AB Most studies exploring the evolution of female mating systems focus on species in which females are either monandric (mate with a single male) or highly polyandric (mate with multiple males), but less is understood about variation in mating decisions within a species. How and why do females of a single species decide whether or not to copulate with additional mates? In this study we attempt to answer this question in the highly dimorphic crab spider, Mecaphesa celer, whose females may be either monandric or polyandric. We tested three hypotheses: (1) a female's decision to remate is based on sequential mate choice; (2) a female's decision to remate has fitness consequences, with polyandry providing increased benefits; and (3) mating order predicts male paternity, following a pattern of first-male sperm precedence. We conducted double-mating trials between females and males of varied sizes and age, quantified six putative fitness benefits obtained by monandric and polyandric females, and tested sperm precedence patterns using the sterile male technique. We found no evidence that female M. celer are performing sequential mate choice. Moreover, we found no difference in fitness between monandric and polyandric females. Finally, we found that paternity in polyandric females follows a pattern of sperm mixing. Mecaphesa celer females' decisions regarding mating with multiple males do not appear to be influenced by comparisons of male attributes or by future fitness benefits. We recommend future studies examining male ejaculate components that might influence female mating decisions. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Contrary to the traditional view that territory defence is a male behaviour, there is now evidence that female birds actively engage in territory defence, either alone or with their mate. In males, song sharing between neighbours has been shown to facilitate territory defence, but little is known about the importance of song sharing for such behaviour in females. Here, I examined sex roles and song element sharing in two related species: the splendid fairy-wren, Malurus splendens, and the variegated fairy-wren, Malurus lamberti. I first described song structure and song element sharing between partners and neighbours in both male and female songs. I then simulated conspecific intrusions by broadcasting a female or a male song within a pair's territory. Both splendid and variegated fairy-wren females sang songs as complex as their male counterparts and responded to playback of simulated conspecific intrusions. Song element sharing with neighbours was common in both species, but only splendid fairy-wren females shared more elements with their mate than with other recorded males on average. Females in each species engaged in different strategies when responding to territory intruders: female splendid fairy-wrens competed with female intruders, while variegated fairy-wren females coordinated their defence with their mates and exhibited cooperative defence behaviours toward male intruders. I discuss the ideas that variation in levels of extrapair paternity and/or female competition may drive the evolution of different female strategies when responding to territory intruders.

AB The ecological approach to cognition provides a clear prediction regarding cognitive performance: performance should be higher in contexts that are ecologically valid than in invalid contexts. Here, we tested this prediction by comparing juvenile and adult cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, with juveniles and adults of five related labrid species. Only the former fully depend on interactions with a large variety of so-called 'client reef fish' for their diet, which involves feeding largely on ectoparasites rather than on preferred client mucus. Our results show that cleaners outperform the other species tested in two contexts that are tightly linked to cognitive challenges during cleaning interactions: the willingness to explore novel objects and the ability to feed against preference in order to increase energy intake. In contrast, all species performed similarly in a spatial discrimination task, which was chosen for its limited ecological relevance to any of the species tested. In conclusion, the cognitive abilities of cleaners seem to be tightly linked to the domain-specific challenges they face in nature. We found no support for the alternative hypothesis that selection for social competence in cleaning interactions leads to domain-general cognitive abilities that also enhance performance in unrelated contexts.

AB In many societies certain individuals play a central role in the execution of collective behaviours and group success, termed 'keystone individuals'. To date, most studies on keystone individuals have focused on their mere presence/absence and have failed to consider how their influence changes as a function of their condition or recent experiences. Here we explore how the influence of putative keystone individuals on group collective behaviour changes as a function of recent increases in cuticular bacterial load. In the spider Stegodyphus dumicola, individuals that exhibit the greatest 'boldness' are important determinants of colony foraging behaviour and success. We topically exposed individual spiders that varied in their boldness to a combination of naturally occurring cuticular bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis, Microbacterium oxydans, Pantoea sp.) known to be harmful to S. dumicola, and then tracked the effects that this exposure had on their colonies' foraging and web-building behaviour. We found that colonies with unexposed keystones attacked prey more quickly and with more attackers than colonies in which the keystone was exposed to bacteria. Moreover, the relationship between keystone individuals' boldness and colonies' attack speed differed based on whether or not the keystone was recently exposed. The number of spiders that participated in nightly web building was greater in colonies containing unexposed keystones than in colonies lacking a keystone, whereas colonies containing recently exposed keystones deployed an intermediate number of individuals. This trend, however, disappeared after the second night of observation. Together, our results suggest that a group's collective behaviour can be altered based on a single individual's recent experience with microbes.

AB Warblers regularly give flight calls during migration, but few studies have addressed flight-calling behaviour by individual birds. In this study, we investigated individual responses to flight calls. We hypothesized that birds would be more likely to give flight calls in response to conspecific flight calls than to heterospecific calls or to other sounds. We studied the flight-calling response of three species of warblers (magnolia warbler, Setophaga magnolia, blackpoll warbler, Setophaga striata, and yellow-rumped warbler, Setophaga coronata) to conspecific calls, calls of one of the other two species or calls of the spring peeper, Pseudacris crucifer, as a control. Additionally, we characterized the proportion of birds calling and the rates of calling (calls/min) for five additional warbler species. We placed each bird individually into an acoustic cone in a soundproof recording studio and recorded its vocalizations before, during and after playing sound cues in the studio. In our experiment, the three species of warblers were more likely to give flight calls in response to flight calls than to the control, and they were more likely to give flight calls to conspecific calls than heterospecific calls. The eight species of warblers that heard conspecific flight calls varied in both the likelihood of giving a response and the rate of calling, and rates of calling also varied between individuals within each species. Most birds that responded gave flight calls soon after hearing flight calls. Our results are some of the first on individual flight-calling responses and flight-calling rates.

   PERFORMANCE
AB In species with alternative reproductive tactics, territorial males (guarders) are usually vigilant against sneakers, and aggressively attempt to eliminate them, imposing serious costs (injuries, sometimes death). Here I examined how sneakers escape from territorial attack in the triplefin blenny, Enneapterygius etheostoma, in the field, with the help of economic flight theory developed for predator-prey interactions. Sneakers hide around spawning sites for sneaking, but they are often detected and attacked by territorial males. Fleeing soon after the initiation of attack could reduce the risk of injuries. However, fleeing may be the wrong decision, resulting in a loss of benefit that could have been obtained by not fleeing, because of uncertainty about whether the sneaker is targeted. As the guarder-sneaker distance decreases, the target would become clear, and uncertainty is reduced accordingly. Therefore, it is predicted that flight initiation distance (FID, the predator-prey distance when escape begins) is determined by the cost-benefit balance. Two types of territorial aggression were identified: the 'direct approach', where the territorial male directly approaches a given sneaker, and the 'reoriented approach', where the territorial male turns to reorient and approaches it following an attack against the first target. A field study showed that sneakers fled earlier in the reoriented approach than in the direct approach. Model selection showed that FID in the reoriented approach was predicted by the guarder-sneaker distance at attack initiation (starting distance) alone, whereas FID in the direct approach was predicted by starting distance, the interaction between the approach speed of territorial males and the duration for which the sneakers monitored them. These results suggest that sneakers adjust flight decision rules to attack episodes, i.e. the economic decision in the direct approach, but the flush early decision in the reoriented approach. This study provides a novel example of adaptation in sneakers. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The modification of communication signals in response to a changing noise environment has been demonstrated in many terrestrial species, although there are comparatively fewer studies in marine mammals. It is rare, even in terrestrial studies, that the response to an anthropogenic source of noise is compared with a natural source of noise in order to evaluate how animals cope with anthropogenic noise. Humpback whales produce two different types of communication signal other than song: vocal sounds and nonvocal sounds from surface-generated behaviours (breaches, pectoral slapping, tail slapping). In this study, the response of humpback whales to noise dominated by wind (a natural source of noise from breaking waves) was compared with the response to noise dominated by a passing vessel (anthropogenic noise). There were no significant changes in frequency or duration of two common vocal sounds in response to increases in either wind or vessel noise. As with previous studies, humpback whale groups, in response to increasing wind-dominated noise, increased their vocal source level and switched from using primarily vocal sounds to surface-generated sounds in their repertoire. In response to an increase in vessel noise, groups did neither. The proportion of nonvocal sounds in their repertoire was significantly correlated with wind speed (and therefore wind noise) regardless of vessel noise suggesting this response is specific to increased wind noise. However, vocal source levels were lower than expected in vessel noise, suggesting a potential for signal masking in these groups. This comparison of response to two different sources of noise shows that humpback whales may not be able to cope with an increase in anthropogenic noise in the same way they cope with an increase in natural noise. The results highlight the benefits of using the response to a natural source to assess the potential effects of anthropogenic noise on animal communication.

AB Sexual conflict arises whenever males and females have divergent reproductive interests. The mechanisms mediating the resolution of sexual conflict have been studied extensively in the context of parental care, where each parent adjusts its decision about how much care to provide based on its partner's workload. However, there is currently no information on the mechanisms mediating the resolution of sexual conflict over personal consumption from a shared resource. We address this gap in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, which breeds on small vertebrate carcasses. The carcass serves as a source of food for both the developing larvae and the caring parents, and parents feed from the carcass for self-maintenance. To study the mechanisms mediating conflict resolution, we experimentally varied the two parents' body size to create variation in carcass consumption. We then assessed whether each parent adjusted its consumption based on its own size, its partner's size and its partner's consumption. As expected, large parents gained more mass than small parents. Furthermore, males paired to large females gained more mass than males paired to small females, and females responded to their partner's mass change, gaining more mass when their partner did. Our study provides insights into the resolution of a new form of sexual conflict, showing that it is mediated through both matching and sealed-bid responses. Our findings also suggest that the resolution models developed in the context of sexual conflict over biparental care may apply more generally than previously thought.

AB Parental care is associated with costs. Communal offspring care in species with altricial young may reduce the costs for a parent, but it comes with a risk of exploitation, jeopardizing the evolution of stable cooperation. Female house mice can either rear their young alone or communally with one or several other females. In the latter case, females pool litters and do not discriminate in their maternal behaviour between their own and alien offspring. Differences in litter size between females, or differences in the amount of investment they provide, might therefore result in one female exploiting another. To analyse the potential for conflict during cooperation, we compared under laboratory conditions the maternal investment (milk quantity and quality at peak lactation, when a female's own offspring were 15 days old) of wild-bred females nursing communally with one partner with that of females nursing solitarily. To increase the probability of asymmetry in litter sizes between communally nursing females, we used a genetic tool to reduce in utero litter size for one of the two partners. Communally nursing females invested according to the total number of pups in the joint nest and not according to their own litter size, making them vulnerable to exploitation. Females that gave birth to the smaller litter consequently overinvested; they had a higher investment per weaned offspring than females that gave birth to larger litters in communal nests or solitarily nursing females. Communal nursing in house mice thus represents a public good situation. Both partners invest according to the combined litter size, but they differ in the benefit they gain, which is the number of weaned offspring. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB A common method for assessing the competitiveness of animals, especially in birds, is to pit pairs of unfamiliar individuals against each other in contests for limited resources under controlled conditions. Although this approach can clarify dominant-subordinate relationships within dyads, it is often difficult to determine competitiveness for a large group of individuals. Here, by using Bayesian statistical inference and 'hypothetical competition groups', which are formed when individuals experience a series of paired contests, we estimated social competitiveness of male house finches, Haemorhous mexicanus. First, Bayesian competitiveness estimates from paired contests successfully predicted future contest outcomes among four unfamiliar individuals (i.e. social dominance). When data of all rank combinations were pooled, future dominant males had, on average, higher competitiveness estimates than future subordinate males. Similarly, Bayesian statistical inference and hypothetical competition groups identified accurately the relative competitiveness of four subgroups of males (i.e. colourful and drab males from urban and rural sites), which matched the result of direct contests when they were all put into the same cage. This consistency reinforces the validity of Bayesian competitiveness estimation based on hypothetical competition groups. Moreover, we found that the competitiveness estimate was negatively linked to male beak size in the Bayesian framework. Males with smaller bills were more competitive than those with larger bills, perhaps due to their elevated foraging motivation (i.e. limited ability to consume or husk large, valuable seeds). We argue that Bayesian competitiveness estimations, together with a series of paired contests, is a sophisticated approach for acquiring a broad understanding of social and individual competitiveness.

AB Foraging methods are highly variable, but can be grouped into two modes: searching and ambush. While research has focused on the functioning of each mode, the question of how animals choose which to use has been largely neglected. Here we consider a forager that exploits prey that are patchily distributed in space and time. This forager can either sit and wait for prey to appear or search for prey, which is more likely to result in encounters with prey but costs more energy and/or exposes the forager to greater predation risk. The currency that natural selection appears to have optimized will be determined by the additional costs of searching and whether there is a risk of starvation. We therefore compare the predictions of models based on currencies that consider only energy and predation risk to state-dependent models in which energy reserves are used to trade off predation rate, starvation rate and investment in growth. The choice of currency qualitatively affects how mode should change when prey abundance and prey patchiness increase. We show how differing prey distributions can explain variation in effects of experimentally increasing prey abundance. Our work has several implications for the study of foraging mode, population dynamics and the methods used to assess population size. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Calls that catalyse group defence, as in the mobbing of predators, appear to facilitate cooperation by recruiting receivers to act collectively. However, even when such signals reliably precede cooperative behaviour, the extent to which the calls function as recruitment signals is unclear. Calls might simply arouse listeners' attention, setting off a cascade of independent responses to the threat. By contrast, they might convey information, for example, about signaller identity and the nature of a threat that affects receivers' decisions to participate. We explored this distinction by investigating a possible long-distance recruitment call used by spotted hyaenas. These social carnivores live in fission-fusion clans and individuals disperse widely within their territories. Putative recruitment calls must therefore attract receivers that are distant from the inciting threat and free to opt out of risky collective aggression. Hyaenas compete with lions over food, and neighbouring clans sometimes engage in violent border clashes. These high-stakes contests are decided based on numerical asymmetries, so hyaenas can only protect critical resources if the dispersed clan can converge quickly at conflict sites. We recorded and analysed whoop bouts produced in multiple contexts and found that bouts produced in response to signs of lion-hyaena conflict had shorter inter-whoop intervals than spontaneous 'display' bouts. In subsequent field playback experiments, resting hyaenas were significantly more likely to move in response to 'recruitment' bouts with shortened intervals than to otherwise identical 'display' bouts. Whereas only stimulus type predicted movement, lower-ranked subjects responded most quickly, perhaps because their feeding opportunities depend on arriving early at any kill site. Results demonstrate that hyaenas possess a signal that can reliably recruit allies across long distances, despite moderating effects of individual circumstances on the strength of receivers' responses.

AB Signals that convey related information may impose selection on each other, creating evolutionary links between different components of the communicative repertoire. Here, we ask about the consequences of the evolutionary loss of one signal (a colour patch) on another (a motion display) in Sceloporus lizards. We present data on male lizards of four species: two pairs of sister taxa representing two independent evolutionary losses of the static colour patch (Sceloporus cozumelae and Sceloporus parvus; Sceloporus siniferus and Sceloporus merriami). Males of the two species that have undergone an evolutionary loss of blue-belly patches (S. cozumelae, S. siniferus) were less active than their blue-bellied sister taxa (S. parvus, S. merriami), consistent with the suggestion that the belly patches were lost to reduce conspicuousness of species with high predation pressure. In contrast, the headbob display appears to have become more, rather than less, conspicuous over evolutionary time. The colour patch is exhibited primarily during aggressive encounters, whereas headbob displays are multifunction signals used in several different contexts, including aggressive encounters. Males of species that have lost the colour patch produced more motion displays, and the structure of those motion displays were more similar to those produced during combat. In both evolutionary episodes, a static colour signal appears to have been replaced by dynamic motion displays that can be turned off in the presence of predators and other unwanted receivers. The predominant pattern is one of evolutionary compensation and interactions between multiple signals that convey related information. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In this review, we explore the extent to which the recent evidence for conformity in nonhuman animals may alternatively be explained by the animals' preference for social information regardless of the number of individuals demonstrating the respective behaviour. Conformity as a research topic originated in human psychology and has been described as the phenomenon in which individuals change their behaviour to match the behaviour displayed by the majority of group members. Recent studies have aimed to investigate the same process in nonhuman animals; however, most of the adopted designs have not been able to control for social influences independent of any majority influence and some studies have not even incorporated a majority in their designs. This begs the question to what extent the 'conformity interpretation' is preliminary and should be revisited in light of animals' general susceptibility to social influences. Similarly, demarcating social from majority influences sheds new light on the original findings in human psychology and motivates reinterpretation of the reported behavioural patterns in terms of social instead of majority influences. Conformity can have profound ramifications for individual fitness and group dynamics; identifying the exact source responsible for animals' behavioural adjustments is essential for understanding animals' learning biases and interpreting cross-species data in terms of evolutionary processes.

AB The good genes hypothesis has long been a major focus of research on the function of extrapair (EP) behaviour by socially monogamous females. It predicts that females should be less faithful when paired to low-quality males and, as EP males become increasingly superior to their social mates, that EP males should be of higher quality than the males they cuckold. Evaluations have yielded mixed results, perhaps in part due to an overly strict interpretation of these predictions. A recent theoretical model demonstrated that while females with high-quality mates should be selective, those with low-quality males may gain good genes benefits by random EP mating, provided EP choosiness has costs, phenotypic indicators are imperfect and sperm competition favours genetic quality. We tested these classic and modified behavioural predictions in the blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii, at two critical steps of EP interactions: courtship and copulation. Support for the classic good genes predictions was limited: EP courtship was more common in females with younger mates, but EP copulation following courtship was not predicted by social mate or relative male age, body size, condition, foot colour (a dynamic ornament) or breeding success, and these characteristics did not differ consistently between social and EP males. However, EP copulation increased with relative attractiveness (greener feet) of the EP male only when the social male was attractive, supporting the model's prediction that female choosiness should increase with social male attractiveness. Moreover, EP copulation probability decreased as EP males became increasingly superior to unattractive females, suggesting that EP males can also be choosy and may constrain female behaviour.

AB Birdsong has long been a prominent model system for studying learning of vocal signals. However, despite widespread acknowledgment of the importance of social factors in shaping birdsong learning, few studies have attempted to parse out and analyse specific social variables in a naturalistic context. Here we report a field study of song learning in song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, which tests the role of a specific social factor, the aggressiveness of potential song tutors. The hypothesis that young birds may learn more from more aggressive tutors was proposed over three decades ago, but has only been tested in laboratory studies, and with mixed results. We assayed aggression and signalling of potential tutors through repeated playback experiments in the field during the song-learning period of a cohort of young sparrows. We also recorded these young birds and traced their repertoires back to potential tutors. We asked whether consistent individual differences in aggressive and signalling behaviours of tutors would predict the degree to which their songs were learned by young birds in the cohort of the year. We sampled more than half of the adult male (potential tutor) population and almost all of the young males (tutees), and replicated the results of a previous study on this same population concerning which songs were learned from which tutors. However, we found no effect of the aggressiveness of potential tutors, their levels of their aggressive signalling or their level of normal singing on their tutoring success. In short, young song sparrows do not learn more from aggressive tutors. We argue for further research on other social factors under natural conditions.

AB Behavioural syndrome studies are commonly descriptive and often find a relationship between boldness, shyness and exploration. However, the mechanisms underlying behavioural syndromes are not well understood. In the present study, we examined the extent to which early experience acts as a modifier of behavioural tendencies in the basal tarantula, Brachypelma smithi. Juvenile individuals were housed for 2 years either in enriched controlled conditions, or in restricted (minimal) conditions. Behavioural assays were completed both in short-term and in long-term increments. We found both short-term and longterm differences in multiple contexts of behaviour between treatments. In addition, individuals in the enriched treatment developed correlations between several behavioural traits whereas individuals in the restricted treatment did not. This result suggests that early environment can induce behavioural syndromes in some populations, or conversely, that continual stress may break down normal behavioural development and thus prevent a behavioural syndrome from emerging. This study provides a cautionary tale for those studying behavioural syndromes in captivity, and because this is a basal spider species, it provides important insight into the evolution of spider behavioural syndromes.

AB Owing to selection for increased mating propensity, males often expose females to sexual harassment. Consequently, females may evolve counterstrategies to retain control of mating. Females can do this directly by resisting copulations, or indirectly by manipulating other males to intervene and prevent the copulation. Uttering copulation calls may be one indirect method for females to trigger male intervention. Copulation calls are commonly observed in mammals, primarily in primates, and also in some birds. Female fowl, Gallus gallus, sometimes utter calls during copulation, particularly in forced copulations with low-ranking males. These loud calls, called distress calls, attract other males and can result in disruption of the copulation, and subsequent mating with the intervening male if he is high ranking. Consequently, uttering such calls can act both to abort a coerced copulation and to generate novel opportunities for females to copulate with higher-ranking males. Nevertheless, uttering loud calls can carry costs, such as attracting predators. Females are therefore predicted to utter copulation calls primarily when doing so offers benefits, which for female fowl requires the presence of another high-ranking male. We tested this prediction by altering the social environment of female domestic fowl, G. g. domesticus. We found that females uttered copulation calls more frequently during copulations in the presence of dominant 'observer' males than in their absence. Thus, we provide evidence of context-dependent utterance of female calls during copulations in a bird. This type of female vocalization is rarely investigated in nonprimate vertebrates, but increased research in this field offers potential to improve understanding of female mate choice strategies and the dynamics of sexual selection.

AB Songs play an important role in premating isolation in birds. However, when songs are learned, experience with both conspecific and heterospecific songs in early life could lead to the development of both mixed songs and mixed preferences. One way that such learning errors can be prevented is if birds can discriminate between songs of different species prior to learning and preferentially memorize conspecific songs. Prior captive studies have shown that white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys, are able to discriminate songs early in the process of song memorization, after about 10 days since hatching. I studied early song discrimination in wild golden-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia atricapilla, the sister species of white-crowned sparrow. The two species occur syntopically in the study population, and therefore sparrows were expected to selectively learn conspecific songs. Playbacks of songs elicited vocal responses from nestlings as young as 6 days old, and nestlings responded more to conspecific songs than to songs of the sympatric white-crowned sparrow subspecies. These results suggest that conspecific song templates exist at the onset of song memorization, and this could allow golden-crowned sparrows to learn the songs of their own species correctly despite syntopy with their sister species. I suggest that studying species recognition prior to learning could provide fresh insights into the evolution of reproductive isolation and song divergence.

AB To mitigate negative impacts of delayed migration it is necessary to understand the causes of avoidance exhibited by animals at behavioural barriers. For downstream migrating juvenile salmon, avoidance of velocity gradients at anthropogenic structures may compromise fitness. Building on previous experimental investigations on salmonid response to velocity gradients, this study aimed to quantify impacts of behaviour on subsequent passage in the presence and absence of visual cues. In an experimental flume, downstream moving juvenile Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, encountered either a high or a low velocity gradient created by an orifice weir, under light (95 lx) or dark (infrared illumination only) conditions. The majority of fish exhibited an observable response on encountering accelerating velocity, with avoidance behaviour elevated when light (45%) in comparison to when dark (12%). More time was spent facing the flow when the velocity gradient was high. Fish that exhibited avoidance were delayed by approximately eight-fold, travelled 3.5 times further, and experienced a higher mean cumulative velocity gradient across the body length (spatial velocity gradient) prior to successful downstream passage. This study highlights the impact of variation in behaviour on fish passage, and the potential for combined multimodal signals (in this instance visual and mechanosensory) to be used to repel fish, for example from hazardous areas such as turbine intakes. Conversely, by limiting information available, undesirable delay, for example at entrances to downstream fish bypasses, may be reduced. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Individuals should invest in conflict management when the costs of conflicts outweigh their benefits. We investigated whether free-ranging wolves engage in conflict resolution. We predicted that reconciliation and consolation should occur because pack members are highly interdependent upon each other owing to the benefits that group members derive from cooperative breeding, cooperative hunting and cooperation in between-group conflicts. As within-group conflict in wolves is low, in accordance with tolerant dominance relationships among pack members, we also predicted a high conciliatory tendency. We collected behavioural data from two packs in Yellowstone National Park (U. S. A.). We report reconciliation, mainly initiated by victims and directed towards aggressors, and solicited and unsolicited consolation. As predicted, the conciliatory tendency was high and comparable to the values reported in primate species with a tolerant dominance style. We suggest that conflict management is favoured in wolves, and more generally in species with a sufficiently high degree of interdependence among group members, as interdependence can explain investment in conflict mitigation without the need to invoke particular relationships of mutual value.

AB The annual 29 000 km long migration of the bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica baueri, around the Pacific Ocean traverses what is arguably the most complex and seasonally structured atmospheric setting on Earth. Faced with marked variation in wind regimes and storm conditions across oceanic migration corridors, individuals must make critical decisions about when and where to fly during nonstop flights of a week's duration or longer. At a minimum, their decisions will affect wind profitability and thus reduce energetic costs of migration; in the extreme, poor decisions or unpredictable weather events will risk survival. We used satellite telemetry to track the annual migration of 24 bar-tailed godwits and analysed their flight performance relative to wind conditions during three major migration legs between nonbreeding grounds in New Zealand and breeding grounds in Alaska. Because flight altitudes of birds en route were unknown, we modelled flight efficiency at six geopotential heights across each migratory segment. Birds selected departure dates when atmospheric conditions conferred the greatest wind assistance both at departure and throughout their flights. This behaviour suggests that there exists a cognitive mechanism, heretofore unknown among migratory birds, that allows godwits to assess changes in weather conditions that are linked (i.e. teleconnected) across widely separated atmospheric regions. Godwits also showed adaptive flexibility in their response not only to cues related to seasonal changes in macrometeorology, such as spatial shifting of storm tracks and temporal periods of cyclogenesis, but also to cues associated with stochastic events, especially at departure sites. Godwits showed limits to their response behaviours, however, especially relative to rapidly developing stochastic events while en route. We found that flight efficiency depended significantly upon altitude and hypothesize that godwits exhibit further adaptive flexibility by varying flight altitude en route to optimize flight efficiency.

AB Understanding the mechanisms responsible for consistent individual differences in behaviour is a recent challenge for behavioural ecology. Although theory is rapidly developing in this area, there are few empirical tests. There are at least two hypotheses to explain why individuals behave differently from one another in a dynamic social environment. The social niche specialization hypothesis proposes that repeated social interactions generate consistent individual differences in social behaviour. The behavioural type hypothesis proposes that an individual's social behaviour reflects its behavioural type. We tested these two hypotheses by manipulating the opportunity for repeated social interactions in groups of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and by measuring the behavioural types of the same individuals in three contexts: when in a novel environment, when presented with an opportunity to associate with conspecifics and when confronted by an intruder. We found no evidence that repeated social interactions increased between-individual variation in social foraging behaviour. Instead, individuals' social foraging behaviour was related to their behavioural type, specifically their shoaling behaviour. In addition, the behavioural types of the members of a group strongly influenced a group's average foraging behaviour. Together, these results do not support the hypothesis that social dynamics within groups generates individual differences in behaviour. Instead, they suggest the reverse: individual differences in behaviour drive group-level dynamics. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Prebreeding habitat selection in birds can often be explained in part by habitat characteristics. However, females may also select habitats on the basis of fidelity to areas of previous reproductive success or use by conspecifics. The relative influences of sociobehavioural attributes versus habitat characteristics in habitat selection has been primarily investigated in songbirds, while less is known about how these factors affect habitat selection processes in migratory waterfowl. Animal resource selection models often exhibit much unexplained variation; spatial patterns driven by social and behavioural characteristics may account for some of this. We radiomarked female lesser scaup, Aythya affinis, in the southwestern extent of their breeding range to explore hypotheses regarding relative roles of habitat quality, site fidelity and conspecific density in prebreeding habitat selection. We used linear mixed-effects models to relate intensity of use within female home ranges to habitat features, distance to areas of reproductive success during the previous breeding season and conspecific density. Home range habitats included shallow water (<= 118 cm), moderate to high densities of flooded emergent vegetation/open water edge and open water areas with submerged aquatic vegetation. Compared with habitat features, conspecific female density and proximity to successful nesting habitats from the previous breeding season had greater influences on habitat use within home ranges. Fidelity and conspecific attraction are behavioural characteristics in some waterfowl species that may exert a greater influence than habitat features in influencing prebreeding space use and habitat selection within home ranges, particularly where quality habitat is abundant. These processes may be of critical importance to a better understanding of habitat selection in breeding birds. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The pulsed nature of new individuals entering into existing communities means that prior residents can greatly influence the establishment and persistence of later-arriving individuals. The unique set of interactions experienced by an individual can also affect how it behaves and its likelihood of winning future encounters. In the present study, we used field experiments to investigate the circumstances under which residency (resident or intruder), behavioural history (prior dominance or subordinance) and body size determined the direction and strength of intraspecific interactions. We paired recently metamorphosed individuals of a coral reef damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, with different suites of these traits to observe how each behaved in a competitive interaction. Our results show the importance of priority and size advantages, and suggest that prior behavioural history has the least influence on the outcome of future confrontations. Prior history was only important when combatants were of similar size, with previously subordinate residents losing against similarly sized previously dominant intruders. Aggression affected space use on a habitat patch and was itself affected by the relative size difference between combatants. Aggressive residents were larger than their competitors, occupied higher areas of the patch and chased intruders to lower areas of the patch and further away from the patch. Space use was not affected by behavioural history. These results demonstrate the importance of priority effects in structuring fish communities, and how an individual's physical and behavioural characteristics interact to predict community dynamics. This has important implications for predicting fish community structure under certain environmental or ecological scenarios. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Spatial variation in predation risk generates a 'landscape of fear', with prey animals modifying their distribution and behaviour in response to this variable predation risk. In systems comprising multiple predators and prey species, a key challenge is distinguishing the independent effects of different predator guilds on prey responses. We exploited the acoustically distinct alarm calls of samango monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis erythrarchus, to create a predator-specific landscape of fear from eagles to assess its impact on space use within mixed regressive-spatial regressive models incorporating data on resource distribution and structural characteristics of the environment. The landscape of fear from eagles was the most significant determinant of samango range use, with no effect of resource availability. The monkeys also selected areas of their range with higher canopies and higher understory visibility, behaviour consistent with further minimizing risk of predation. These results contrast with those of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus, at the same site for which the landscapes of fear from leopards and baboons were the most significant determinants of space use. While highlighting that predation risk is a key driver of primate behaviour in this population, the landscapes of fear experienced by samango monkeys and vervet monkeys appear to differ despite exposure to identical predator guilds. This emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between the risk effects of different predators in understanding prey ecology, but also that closely related prey species may respond to these predator-specific risks in different ways.

AB When animals encounter new food, they must decide whether to eat it and risk being poisoned, or avoid it but risk losing valuable food resources. Some individuals within a foraging population are 'adventurous consumers' and readily accept novel food items into their diets, while others display an active and long-term avoidance of novel food, called 'dietary conservatism' (DC). Previous studies have shown the phenomenon of DC in many bird species and in a temperate fish, the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. However, it is unknown to what extent DC exists in other fish species, and so in the current study, we investigated the occurrence of DC in four species of tropical fish belonging to the poeciliid family (guppy, Poecilia reticulata, mollie, Poecilia sphenops, platy, Xiphophorus maculatus, and green swordtail, Xiphophorus hellerii). We detected DC strong enough to drive a novel prey morph from initial rarity to fixation in a prey population in all four poeciliid species. Despite some underlying differences in pre-existing preferences for prey colour, there was no significant difference between poeciliid species, sexes or sizes in the likelihood of the novel morph reaching fixation; neither was there an effect of the relative conspicuousness or crypsis of the novel prey. Poeciliids were, however, less likely than sticklebacks to drive the novel prey morph to fixation. These results provide strong evidence for the widespread existence of DC in fish populations from a range of habitats, but not all fish species exhibit this trait at the same frequency.

AB The acquisition of information such as the location and quality of food, mates or shelter is a key survival requirement for animals. Individuals can acquire information through personal experience (private information) or through observing and interacting with others (social information). Environmental spatial and temporal heterogeneity can mean that sometimes social information conflicts with private knowledge. We tested how personality affected the importance placed on public versus private information in wild female guppies when these two information sources came into conflict. We found that boldness and sociality affected decisions to use conflicting social and private information. Bolder females used social information to avoid competition and/or potential patch depletion, whereas highly social individuals preferred the presence of conspecifics over rich foraging opportunities. There was no evidence of a speed -accuracy trade-off in a spatial associative learning task; rather, bold female guppies learned both more quickly and more accurately than shy females. We found no evidence of a behavioural syndrome between boldness and sociality which is consistent with previous studies on this population. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Parallels between birdsong and human language are numerous and include particular temporal arrangements of acoustic units and the existence of dialects. In animal communication, modifications of the temporal ordering of existing acoustic units have rarely been clearly linked with changes in information content, particularly in a natural environment. Here, we show that the organization of birdsong units ('syllables') in sequences supports interindividual relationships within skylark communities. We manipulated the temporal arrangement of song dialect variants ('shared phrases') in the skylark, Alauda arvensis, a songbird with a very large repertoire of syllables and complex song. When tested with playback experiments performed in the field, skylarks were able to perceive subtle differences in the ordering of syllables. Modifications of the syllable ordering within shared phrases changed the information content from 'group member' to 'unfamiliar individual' and induced more aggressive reactions than shared phrases with a preserved syllable arrangement. Shared phrases often varied between individuals in the number of successive repetitions of similar syllable types, but were very consistent in terms of syllable type ordering. Our results indicate that skylarks rely not simply on the composition in syllable types of shared phrases to recognize group members, but on syllable type ordering. Shared phrases could be perceived by birds as 'auditory objects' embedded within songs. Alternatively, birds might identify incorrect phrases using grammatical rules governing the succession of syllables composing the phrases shared by their group. The presence of between-individual variation in phrase length, associated with consistent syllable type ordering revealed by our analysis, suggests that the latter hypothesis is more likely. Our results show that birds perceive disruptions in the natural temporal pattern of song units, and that this temporal pattern is behaviourally salient and carries information.

AB The division of labour plays a major role in the success of social insects. For instance, through social prophylaxis, the spread of pathogens within the colony can be reduced if corpse removal is the concern of a specialized group of ants. However, in relatively small colonies, the number of dead individuals and the amount of waste may be too low to justify a specialized group of corpse carriers. We examined the corpse removal habits of the common red ant, Myrmica rubra. Ants acting as corpse carriers were not strictly specialized in corpse management, but split their time between disposing of the dead and foraging. Some corpse-carrying individuals, however, developed a short-term specialization by making several successive corpse transports. Corpse carriers limited cross-contamination by remaining mostly outside the nest and congregating near the nest entrance when resting inside.

AB Mating displays are often composed of multiple signals in multiple sensory modalities, with each individual signal contributing to the attractiveness of the displaying individual. Adult mate preferences for some of these signals are learned during premating, or juvenile, social experience with a sexually mature individual. While learned mate preferences have been described in multiple taxa, it is still unclear how the different display signals perceived during the learning period influence the development of adult mate preferences. Of particular interest is whether a learned mate preference for a sexual signal in one modality is context dependent (i.e. dependent on a second signal in either the same or a different sensory modality). Here we test whether a signal in one modality (odour) influences the interpretation (aversion or preference learning) of signals in a different modality (wing colour patterns) using the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Previously we showed that female B. anynana learn to prefer additional ornaments, UV-reflective white spots, on the wings of males if they are exposed to these ornaments on the first day after eclosion from pupae. We now show that females exposed to males with manipulated odour do not learn to prefer these additional ornaments, and learn to avoid the wild-type male ornamentation. This aversion learning, where animals learn to avoid visual signals previously coupled with unattractive odours and to prefer visual signals previously coupled with attractive odours, demonstrates that visual mate preference learning in a butterfly is context dependent, and that specific sexual signals may have epistatic effects on mate preference development.

ID PARENTAL CARE
AB Offspring of many animals develop in environments in which they are exposed to high densities of potentially harmful bacteria. For example, larvae of the carrion beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides face significant challenges from the bacteria they encounter during their development on decomposing vertebrate carcasses. We tested the idea that larvae secrete antimicrobial compounds during development to defend themselves against microbial exposure. We first showed that larval secretion of active antimicrobials peaked during the early stages of development. As has been found previously for parental secretions, larval secretions were active against Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria, indicating that they might be based on lysozyme-like compounds. Finally, consistent with this antibacterial activity, we showed that larval survival declined significantly when challenged with lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus aureus but not when challenged with a lysozyme-susceptible strain of the same species. These results demonstrate that Nicrophorus larvae are not simply passive recipients of social immunity derived from their parents, but that they are active participants in its production.

AB Many animals use camouflage to avoid predation. Their crypticity, that is, the degree of a visual match between the animal's body and the background, affects their survival. Therefore, they may develop the ability to choose an appropriate background, which matches the animal's own colour pattern. We have previously shown that moths, Hypomecis roboraria, have the ability to increase their crypticity by repositioning their bodies from the initial landing position to the final, more cryptic, position. However, this repositioning behaviour is not always performed: some moths stay put on the initial landing position. We hypothesized that the moth's decision whether or not to reposition itself is related to its crypticity at the landing spot. We determined the crypticity from a detection task experiment, in which 'human foragers' searched for the moths in photos of moths at their landing spots. Moths that landed on the less cryptic positions were more likely to reposition themselves to the more cryptic positions. In contrast, moths that had already landed on substantially cryptic positions were less likely to reposition themselves. We suggest that the tactile cues received by moths from furrows and crevices, the elements of bark structure responsible for the colour pattern of the bark, may play a role in mediating this adaptive behaviour that results in improving the moths' visual crypticity.

AB Interactions between individuals in a society are the basis of effective task allocation. Division of labour plays a critical role in the ecological efficiency of social insect societies. In this study we tested whether social context, specifically the number of workers present, affects thermoregulatory task performance in honeybees, Apis mellifera. We report here that worker bees assayed singly were significantly less likely to initiate fanning behaviour in response to elevated temperature than bees assayed in small groups of three or 10 workers. Bees assayed in groups also showed lower response thresholds than those assayed alone. The likelihood for fanning behaviour varied significantly among behavioural castes, while thermal response thresholds did not. These results suggest that worker task performance depends on the presence of other workers and offer another method by which division of labour in societies is organized.

AB Vocal interactions, such as call exchanges or chorusing, are common behaviours in many animal species and their function has often been attributed to social bonding. However, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of vocalizations as bonding signals in comparison to other affiliative behaviours. We tested the hypothesis that male chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, pant hoot chorusing, a common behaviour in these primates, is a reliable but also flexible signal of affiliative relationships. The results of our study, conducted on the Kanyawara community of chimpanzees in Uganda, show that males were more likely to join in with the pant hoot of preferred long-term social partners to form a chorus. This supports the hypothesis that this behaviour is a good indicator of strong or long-term social bonds between male chimpanzees. However, our results also show that pant hoot chorusing reliably reflects short-term affiliations between males. For instance, male dyads were more likely to be involved in affiliative behaviours, such as reciprocated grooming, joint nonvocal displays and coalitions, on days when they chorused together, compared to days when they did not. This pattern applied to both preferred and neutral social partners. Moreover, on a short-term basis chorusing was a better indicator of other affiliative behaviours than grooming. We suggest that in male chimpanzees pant hoot choruses are efficient signals of short-term affiliative relationships. We conclude that potentially low-cost bonding behaviours such as coordinated vocal displays might be especially adaptive in highly fluid fission-fusion societies where grouping patterns are often unpredictable.

AB Parents have limited resources and, when simultaneously rearing multiple offspring, are expected to favour particularly valuable offspring. Because offspring characteristics like sex and ornamentation influence future reproductive value, these traits may influence parental favouritism. Parents in high-quality nest environments should prefer sons because sons show greater variability in reproductive potential than daughters. Moreover, when ornamental plumage coloration is condition dependent, parents should favour brighter over duller sons. We tested parental favouritism for fledgling-aged eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, a species in which fledglings display condition-dependent UV-blue coloration on their wings and tails. We simultaneously threatened two offspring with mock predators and recorded which offspring the parents defended. In accordance with the predicted value of offspring, fathers protected brighter over duller sons and protected sons over daughters when mated to high-quality mates. Mothers did not discriminate between sons and daughters or between brighter and duller sons. These results suggest that ornamental plumage coloration in juvenile bluebirds functions as a signal in father-off-spring interactions. Paternal and maternal responses of eastern bluebirds to offspring characteristics may differ because of differences in parental allocation strategies or because males assess offspring quality based on variation in plumage coloration, a trait that also functions in competitive interactions among adult males.

AB Drosophila melanogaster males court females through a series of steps. In one of these steps, the male vibrates his wings to produce a courtship song that is species specific. Variation in the shape of Drosophila wings has been described among populations and species, but it is still unknown whether this variation influences the courtship process. In our laboratory, replicate strains were obtained from a natural population of D. melanogaster by artificial selection for rounded or elongated wing shapes. We used those strains and a nonselected strain to test the influence of wing shape on male mating success. We observed significantly higher success by males from strains with elongated wings when competing with those with rounded or nonselected wings, regardless of the female type. In addition, smaller males were more successful. We also recorded the courtship songs produced by males of different wing shape strains. We detected some variation among the courtship song produced by males depending on the original strain. However, this difference did not fully explain the success of males with elongated wings. Our results therefore show that wing shape has to be considered as influencing male mating success in Drosophila. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Offspring provisioning and nest defence are important forms of parental care. In birds, parents that engage in nest defence behaviour have to interrupt nestling provisioning with potentially harmful consequences for offspring growth and condition. To maximize fitness, parents should trade off optimal levels of offspring provisioning versus nest defence, but relatively little is known about how parents allocate their time between these two activities and how parental decisions to postpone provisioning vary as a function of the intensity of nest predation risk. We found that pairs of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, adjusted parental care behaviours according to perceived immediate risk levels by switching from offspring provisioning to nest defence. In the presence of a direct nest predation threat, parents interrupted offspring provisioning for longer than in response to a novel object close to the nest, but still gradually resumed provisioning activity, probably because of a decrease in perceived predation risk over time. By increasing their provisioning effort once the immediate threat had diminished, parents compensated at least partly for the lost provisioning opportunities during high-risk situations. Hence, by adaptively adjusting the temporal trade-off between different parental care behaviours according to the perceived risk, blue tits are presumably able to mitigate potential negative long-term consequences of interruptions in provisioning during high-risk situations for offspring growth and condition.

AB Collective fleeing is a complex process resulting from a network of environmental stimuli and interindividual interactions. Studies on fleeing behaviour have focused on the information spread initiated by a few stimulated individuals. Our goal was to link individuals' responses to the collective fleeing dynamics for gregarious insects simultaneously exposed to a stimulus. We found that an information cascade process occurs in groups of cockroaches, Periplaneta americana, simultaneously exposed to a light stimulus. Moreover, the global fleeing pattern depended on group size. The steps of the response (reacting to the stimulus, finding an opening and leaving the shelter) differed in their sensitivity to group size. First, immobile individuals inhibited the fleeing response, while moving individuals amplified it. Second, once individuals had reacted, they reached an opening and stopped. Their low probability per unit time of finding this opening was constant regardless of group size or the mobility level of group members. Finally, the individual probability of leaving the shelter increased with the number of moving individuals still inside. We integrated the different behavioural steps, analysed independently, into a stochastic model. The results based on this model are in agreement with our experimental observations. This model constitutes a template that enables the exploration of the influence of environmental and social factors at work in other species and situations.

AB The evolution of cooperative behaviour requires mechanisms to avoid investing in conspecifics that are not increasing an individual's direct or indirect fitness. This suggests that selection should favour the capability of recognizing kin.
   One mechanism to discriminate between kin and nonkin is based on phenotype matching, when an individual learns a template of itself or of its kin and can later use this template to recognize even unfamiliar kin. In this study, we found that in zebrafish olfactory kin recognition depended on an imprinting process that required the two-step learning process of olfactory as well as visual cues of kin. Larvae that were exposed to either visual or olfactory cues or to both cues of nonkin did not show imprinting. This capability of imprinting on kin but not on nonkin cues can be explained by genetic predisposition or self-referencing. Through this combined imprinting process larvae can avoid false imprinting on unrelated individuals. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fission-fusion systems provide models for studying grouping decisions and social complexity in a range of taxa, as individuals act to manage risks and enhance reproductive success. African savannah elephants, Loxodonta africana africana, live in a fluid society where individual relationships persist over decades and affect reproductive success. Social structures have yet to be fully characterized for forest elephants, Loxodonta africana cyclotis. Aggregations at natural forest clearings, which are frequent in this subspecies, may offer social benefits in addition to nutritional resources. We examined the social functions of aggregations in Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Republic of Congo. We tested whether clearings function as 'social arenas' by examining how social opportunities affected the timing and duration of visits, and how short-term grouping decisions were affected by age, sex, group size and number of elephants present. Aggregations reflected a fission-fusion society similar to that observed in savannah elephants. Grouping patterns were largely unaffected by the number of elephants present, from which we infer that elephants were not acting to minimize competition. Social opportunities affected visit patterns such that visits were longer when others were present. Social opportunities were maximized by joining large groups, often including older elephants, or, for males, parties with females. Large and dynamically changing social groups in clearings offer potential for information exchange and the maintenance of social relationships. Demonstrating that fission-fusion operates in forest elephant society allows future research to focus on cost-benefit modelling, to understand the fitness consequences of these groupings.

AB The construction of dominance hierarchies for animal societies is an important aspect of understanding the nature of social relationships, and the models to calculate dominance ranks are many. However, choosing the appropriate model for a given data set may appear daunting to the average behaviourist, especially when many of these models assume linearity of dominance. Here, we present a method to test whether or not a data set fits the assumption of linearity using the Bradley-Terry model as a representative of the class of models that assume linearity. Our method uses the geometry of a posterior distribution of possible rankings given the data by using a random walk on this distribution. This test is intuitive, efficient, particularly for large number of individuals, and represents an improvement over previous linearity tests because it takes into account all information (i.e. both linear and apparently circular or nonlinear information) from the data with few restrictions due to high dimensionality. Such a test is not only useful in determining whether a linear hierarchy is relevant to a given animal society, but is necessary in justifying the results of any analysis for which the assumption of linearity is made, such as the Bradley-Terry model. If the assumption of linearity is not met, other methods for ranking, such as the beta random field method proposed by Fushing et al. (2011, PLoS One, 6, e17817) should be considered.

AB Although inbreeding is known for its negative consequences, recent theory predicts that inclusive fitness gains from inbreeding should outweigh the costs of inbreeding depression in many situations, resulting in optimal fitness from mating with intermediate relatives (optimal inbreeding). Consistent with this theory, in a previous field study on Drosophila melanogaster, we found that males were more closely related to their mate than to females sampled randomly from the same population. However, in that study relatedness was higher than expected between all individuals collected mating, not just actual pairs, suggesting factors other than mate choice may have been at play. In the present study we aimed to gain a more detailed understanding of how relatedness influences male and female mate preference in D. melanogaster by investigating preference between pairs of known relatedness, under controlled conditions. We used multivariate techniques to investigate linear and nonlinear effects of relatedness while accounting for variation in morphological traits thought to be under sexual selection. Consistent with the field results, we found that females accepted courtship from closely related males more rapidly. We detected no influence of relatedness on the largely male controlled traits, latency to first courtship and copulation duration. These results are consistent with optimal inbreeding theory and provide weight to the idea that there may need to be a shift in the way we think about inbreeding. More work is warranted in this area.

AB Animals that live in communication range of multiple conspecific receivers have the potential to interfere with their neighbours' signals, or to avoid interference by signalling at different times. We used both an observational and experimental approach to study signal timing in lekking tropical birds. We recorded duetting pairs of male long-tailed manakins, Chiroxiphia linearis, during periods when two neighbouring pairs were calling concurrently, and during playback of a simulated pair of nearby rival males. We used three complementary analytical techniques to evaluate whether birds varied the timing of their duet calls relative to nearby animals: circular statistics, resampling analysis and duty cycle models. Our analyses reveal that long-tailed manakins produce duets with nonrandom timing with respect to the calls of their rivals. During natural bouts of concurrent calling, all three analytical techniques revealed that manakins time their duets to avoid overlap. In response to playback, males showed more variable strategies. Males overlapped duets more during playback than they did under natural conditions and, in some cases, they overlapped playback duets at higher levels than would be expected based on chance. Our study shows that males alter the timing of their calls in response to the vocalizations of others around them, and it uncovers similarities in the acoustic signalling behaviour of lekking birds relative to the better-studied signalling behaviour of territorial birds. We also show that different null models of signal timing yield different insights into animal signalling behaviour. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Theory predicts that mating systems are influenced by sex-specific selection pressures and the dispersion of females, but potential constraints imposed by a species' life history and physiology are rarely considered. Sloths, or 'perezosos' (the 'lazies') in Spanish, are one of the most sedentary terrestrial mammals on Earth, and we hypothesized that their low mobility would constrain the ability of males to take advantage of the 'polygamy potential' of their environment. We characterized the reproductive strategy of Hoffmann's two-toed sloths, Choloepus hoffmanni, in an agro-ecosystem in northeastern Costa Rica by assigning paternity, characterizing the spatial distribution of related individuals and describing the space use of 157 individuals. Spatial patterns of relatedness suggested that natal dispersal was female biased and sufficient to avoid inbreeding. Five (36%) adult males sired offspring with more than one female, and we observed three apparent extraterritorial matings, indicating that sloths were not strictly monogamous. Generally, adult males were segregated and appeared to show some territoriality in core areas, although home ranges of adjacent males overlapped in areas of low use. On average, male home ranges encompassed more than three females, and females usually occurred within the home range of more than one male. These patterns of space use and relatedness suggest males monopolize space more than they do females, and that the mating system of Hoffmann's two-toed sloth involves a mixture of polygyny and promiscuity. Neighbouring males were more closely related than expected, suggesting that a certain level of tolerance among males may stem from the benefits of kin selection and the limited ability of males to monopolize breeding opportunities.

AB Behavioural traits are often plastic and can allow animals important flexibility when environmental conditions vary. However, studies of animal personality suggest that behaviour can be 'constrained' to certain behavioural types, leading to consistent differences between individuals. Few studies have investigated the interaction between personality traits and the need for flexibility in individuals over different, naturally occurring situations in the wild. We investigated whether free-living Namibian rock agamas, Agama planiceps, were constrained by personality types or showed behavioural plasticity when their environmental conditions changed dramatically between the dry and rainy seasons. We examined three key behaviours: risk taking as measured by flight initiation distance, time budgets focusing on time spent conspicuous and rates of signalling directed at conspecifics. Risk-taking behaviour of males showed stable between-individual differences, but no between-individual differences in plasticity, supporting previous evidence that antipredator behaviour is determined by personality in this species. Time spent conspicuous showed a response to season, and an interaction between the individual and season, suggesting that behavioural plasticity itself may be a personality trait. In contrast, signalling behaviour changed in response to season but did not vary consistently between individuals. We suggest that where there are reliable environmental cues, individual plasticity will be favoured over consistency in the relevant behaviours.

AB Air-breathing divers are assumed to dive and surface in a way that maximizes their realized benefit. Dive duration in diving animals seems to depend on the purpose of the dive. Although the purpose of dives in most marine mammals and birds is undoubtedly foraging, this is not always true for so-called 'surfacers' that spend most of their time underwater for various purposes (e. g. foraging, resting, mating and migration). In this study, we investigated the relationships among dive duration, the amount of activity per unit time, the air volume in the lungs and postdive surface duration of four hawksbill turtles, Eretmochelys imbricata, which are surfacers, using multisensor data loggers. Our results demonstrated that hawksbills generally perform dives with consistent relationships between dive duration, the amount of activity per unit time and the air volume in the lungs, and that dives are followed by short periods at the surface, indicating that hawksbills rarely perform anaerobic dives. This longer dive duration compared to the length of surface resting indicates that the diving strategy of hawksbill turtles maximizes their time spent submerged. This strategy seems unique to sea turtles and surfacers in general. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, using a personality approach for studies of animal behaviour has increased our ability to predict an individual's or population's behavioural responses to external stimuli. At a population level, different behavioural types (e. g. bold and shy) often exist, and the behaviour of different types may not be free to vary across different situations. In the present study, we examined whether a predator introduction induced shifts in boldness and if predator-induced changes in behaviour depended on the individual's original behavioural type in the field cricket Gryllus integer. We also studied whether exposure to a natural predator affected the formation of a behavioural syndrome between aggression and boldness or the consistency of boldness. We define a behavioural syndrome as an association between functionally different behaviours or consistency in a behaviour over time or contexts. We found that exposure to a predator affected behavioural antipredator responses, measured as the time to recover from freezing (immobility). Moreover, we found that the different behavioural types expressed different behavioural responses to predator introduction (i.e. shy individuals became bolder and bold individuals more shy). However, an aggressiveness-boldness behavioural syndrome was not detected in either the treatment or control groups, and early antipredator responses were rank order repeatable only in the control group. We suggest that individuals' behavioural antipredator responses under increased predation risk depend on the individual's original behavioural type and that increased risk may break apart the consistency of behaviour.

AB Aphidius ervi is a parasitic wasp of several aphid species, including Acyrthosiphon pisum. This wasp is used as a biological control agent of its host aphid species in many regions of the world. Compared with responses to volatiles from intact plants, A. ervi females respond to host-infested plant volatiles but not to nonhost-infested plant volatiles. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that A. ervi preferred host aphid-infested plant volatiles to volatiles from intact plants only when they had been exposed to the host aphid-infested plant volatiles during their developmental stages (larval to emergence stages). The results suggested that A. ervi females learn the host-infested volatiles during their development and we tested this hypothesis in this study. Learning occurred in two steps: during the late larval to prepupal stages (the first learning stage) and during adult emergence (the second learning stage). Furthermore, we observed specificity to the host plant volatiles in the two-step learning. The preference for host-infested plant volatiles was modified when the wasps had been exposed to host aphid-infested plant volatiles in the first stage and then exposed to nonhost aphid-infested plant volatiles in the second stage. When they were exposed to nonhost aphid-infested plant volatiles in the first stage, wasp preference for volatiles was not detected, irrespective of their exposure to either host or nonhost aphid-infested plants in the second stage. The ecological functions of the two-step learning are discussed. (c) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although killer whale, Orcinus orca, dialects have been studied in detail in several populations, little attempt has been made to compare dialect characteristics between populations. In this study we investigated geographical variation in monophonic and biphonic calls among four resident populations from the North Pacific Ocean: Northern and Southern residents from British Columbia and Washington State, southern Alaska residents, and eastern Kamchatka residents. We tested predictions generated by the hypothesis that call variation across populations is the result of an accumulation of random errors and innovation by vertical cultural transmission. Call frequency contours were extracted and compared using a dynamic time-warping algorithm. We found that the diversity of monophonic calls was substantially higher than that of biphonic calls for all populations. Repertoire diversity appeared to be related to population size: in larger populations, monophonic calls were more diverse and biphonic calls less diverse. We suggest that the evolution of both monophonic and biphonic calls is caused by an interaction between stochastic processes and directional selection, but the relative effect of directional selection is greater for biphonic calls. Our analysis revealed no direct correlation between call repertoire similarity and geographical distance. Call diversity within predefined call categories, types and subtypes, showed a high degree of correspondence between populations. Our results indicate that dialect evolution is a complex process influenced by an interaction among directional selection, horizontal transmission and founder effects. We suggest several scenarios for how this might have arisen and the implications of these scenarios for call evolution and population history.

AB Variation in male testosterone levels across and within species is known to be related to mating systems, male dominance rank and aggression rates. When aggression enhances access to mates, dominance status and androgen levels correlate positively. Deviation from this pattern is expected when access to females is determined by factors other than male dominance or when high androgen levels interfere with nonaggressive forms of male reproductive strategies such as paternal care and pair bonding. Bonobos offer an interesting study species to test the relationship between male dominance, aggression and intersexual relationships. On the one hand, males form dominance hierarchies and compete for access to females and mating success varies with rank. On the other hand, males and females are equally dominant, male rank is not only the result of aggression, and strong intersexual relationships might be crucial to male reproductive success. We used behavioural and physiological data from wild bonobos to test relationships between behavioural correlates of mate competition and androgen levels. Aggression and rank were positively correlated, as were aggression and mating success. In the presence of potentially fertile females, male aggression increased but only low-ranking, less aggressive males showed increases in testosterone levels, which consequently tended to be negatively related to rank. High-ranking males who had lower testosterone levels and were less responsive in their testosterone increase were more often involved in friendly relationships with unrelated females. These results suggest that, in bonobos, amicable relationships between the sexes rather than aggressive interactions mediate males' physiological reactivity during periods of mate competition.

AB Kin-based societies typically form when offspring prolong their association with the parents. It has been suggested that offspring delay natal dispersal because of the benefits that such association conveys. We found that in cooperatively breeding carrion crows, Corvus corone corone, risk-prone fathers facilitated their offspring's access to novel and potentially dangerous food. In crow groups, dominant breeding males, which share food nepotistically with their offspring, made the first contact with novel food, followed by male immigrants, whereas retained offspring and breeding females were last. This order mirrored the dominance ranks in the group, but it was unlikely to be enforced through social interference. In groups that were simultaneously presented with two identical novel food sources that could not be monopolized by one individual, subordinates only used the one that was first explored by the dominant male. This suggests that foraging decisions in crows were affected by the fear of the novel food and that the explorative behaviour of the dominant breeding male provided cues that helped subordinates to overcome their neophobia. In their natal territory, inexperienced offspring therefore gained access to food without incurring the risk of exploring. For a foraging opportunist such as the carrion crow, this may convey survival benefits that could play a role in driving delayed natal dispersal.

AB Studies on social spacing usually analyse spatial distribution using a single distribution index, and compare this with expected values assuming random spacing. However, different distribution indices give information on different aspects of spatial distribution. Furthermore, when animals use some parts of the study area more often because of environmental factors, assumptions of random spacing do not apply. As a contribution to the development of spatial distribution analysis methodology, we compared three distribution indices: nearest-neighbour distances (NND), coefficient of variation of interindividual distances and coefficient of variation of Dirichlet polygon areas. Distribution was studied at different animal densities, in the presence or absence of a wooden structure. Rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, were chosen as the model species because of their apparent plasticity of spatial behaviour. The observed distribution was compared with a random distribution and with a resource-corrected random distribution that accounted for environmental influences on spacing. Comparisons with these two distributions led to different conclusions. This emphasizes the limited usefulness of comparisons with the random distribution, especially in more heterogeneous environments. However, divergence from random spacing could potentially be used to assess the relative importance of resources. Especially for 6-week-old rabbits, the density at which no evidence of avoidance was found differed between the distribution indices. This underlines the need to use multiple indices when studying social spacing. Nine-week-old rabbits generally avoided each other's proximity, with NND indicating proximity avoidance even in the largest pens. Contrary to expectations, the wooden structure seemed to decrease social attraction between rabbits. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many orb-web spiders put silken decorations that reflect ultraviolet (UV: <400 nm) light in their web. The function of web decorations has been extensively studied: they may increase foraging success or reduce predation risk, but can also be a liability for the web-building spiders. Earlier studies have shown that the reflectance of silken decorations in UV helps an araneophagic jumping spider, Portia labiata, locate and prey on a web-decorating spider, Argiope versicolor. However, it is unclear whether the reflectance of silken decorations in UV is more important as a cue than reflectance in other wavelengths (400-700 nm) for P. labiata to locate the web-building spiders. We investigated the relative importance of reflection of web decorations at different wavelengths in assisting P. labiata in locating its prey, A. versicolor. Portia labiata was given a choice of four webs with cruciform silk decorations built by A. versicolor, the appearance of which was manipulated using coloured filters that selectively blocked UV, short-wavelength (SW: 400-500 nm), medium-wavelength (MW: 500-600 nm) and long-wavelength light (LW: 600-700 nm). Significantly fewer P. labiata preferentially approached the decorated webs from which the reflectance in UV was blocked than webs from which the reflectance in SW, MW and LW was blocked. These results suggest that the reflectance of decorations in UV is a more important visual cue than short, medium and long wavelengths for P. labiata to locate the decorated webs.

AB Parasites can cause changes in the phenotypes of their hosts that may benefit the parasite, the host, or both. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of hosteparasite interactions it is necessary to first examine the effect of parasitic infestation on the host phenotype and whether the host or parasite benefits from these changes. The fly Ormia ochracea parasitizes the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, and it uses male song to locate hosts for its lethal larvae. Adult flies preferentially orient to male songs with faster and longer chirps. We tested the effect of larval infestation on two types of host traits. First, we tested whether infestation affects male singing activity and song characters. Infested males were significantly less likely to sing than noninfested males, and when they did sing, they sang less frequently. Infestation thus reduced a male's ability to attract mates, which may benefit the parasitoid if mating activity increases predation, superparasitism and/or energetic costs for their hosts. No song character we measured, however, differed between infested and noninfested males. Second, we tested whether infestation affects host mass. Infested males gained more mass than noninfested males, which was not explained by the reduced singing of infested males. Importantly, parasitoids that developed in males that gained more mass were heavier as pupae, which may increase their viability and reproductive success as adults. These changes in the host may be beneficial side-effects of the pathology of parasitism, the result of a host-compensatory response, or the result of host manipulation by the parasitoid.

AB Understanding group size variation is a major challenge in animal ecology. However, we argue that understanding group sizes from an individual point of view (i.e. individual group sizes) and the relationship with population group sizes may be even more important. This may seem redundant, but in the present study we show that it is not. We analysed colony sizes of 20 seabird species breeding in Britain and Ireland from the Seabird 2000 project (19 978 colonies; 3 779 919 nests) comparing group (colony) size frequency distributions (GSFDs) with their individual group size frequency distribution (IndGSFD) counterparts. We did so for the first time for a number of species with semilogarithmic plots, and correlated eight statistics from each GSFD-IndGSFD pair. Shape-related variables (e. g. skewness) of GSFD-IndGSFD pairs were highly unrelated with only 1-15% of redundancy. In fact, species with similar GSFDs had individuals concentrating in either the largest or the medium-sized groups. There was a trend towards those species with higher group size variation having individuals living in a narrower range of group sizes. Some group size-related measures (e. g. mean group size) showed a tight linear correlation in log-log scatterplots between GSFDs and IndGSFDs. However, this correlation disappeared in linear scatterplots for two of the four measures. Moreover, group size-related measures were always a poor surrogate of corresponding individual group size measures. We discuss how animal grouping research could benefit from similar comparisons between GSFDs and IndGSFDs and how this can be carried out in a meaningful way.

AB We investigated whether jungle crows can select a given quantity of items (printouts of shapes and symbols) when simultaneously presented with smaller or larger quantities. We presented jungle crows with the choice between two sets of discrete homogeneous quantities (two versus five) in a fixed configural pattern during training. When crows could discriminate five items (15 out of 20 correct choices in two blocks of 10 trials each), they received control tests for non-numerical cues such as element configuration, shape, and total filled area and novel quantity (3 versus 5, 4 versus 5, 5 versus 6, 5 versus 7 and 5 versus 8) tests. During training, jungle crows learned the discrimination task relatively quickly. Additionally, the selections were generally not controlled by the non-numerical cues, indicating that the crows were responding to quantity. Jungle crows selected the familiar larger quantity in smaller sets (3 versus 5 and 4 versus 5) and the novel larger in larger comparisons (5 versus 7 and 5 versus 8) except that of 5 versus 6 quantities. These results suggest that jungle crows have a natural tendency to select the larger quantities and that decisions were affected by the numerical ratio and stimuli magnitude, indicating the use of analogue magnitude mechanism for numerical judgement, as is observed in other animals.

AB Dogs are especially skilful at comprehending human communicative signals. This raises the question of whether they are also able to produce such signals flexibly, specifically, whether they helpfully produce indicative ('showing') behaviours to inform an ignorant human. In experiment 1, dogs indicated the location of an object more frequently when it was something they wanted themselves than when it was something the human wanted. There was some suggestion that this might be different when the human was their owner. So in experiment 2 we investigated whether dogs could understand when the owner needed helpful information to find a particular object (out of two) that they needed. They did not. Our findings, therefore, do not support the hypothesis that dogs communicate with humans to inform them of things they do not know. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Insect social parasites need to overcome host colonies' defences to exploit their resources successfully. Sophisticated sensory deception mechanisms to break the host's barriers have been repeatedly reported for many social parasites, possibly concealing the importance of open fighting, a more ancestral strategy. Understanding the relative importance of fooling and fighting is primarily challenging when the two strategies seem both available and advantageous. We focused on the paper wasp social parasite-host system Polistes sulcifer-P. dominulus, where both fooling and fighting have been suggested to play a role during usurpation contests. Host aggression is elicited by the chemical cues (hydrocarbons) that intruders bear on their cuticle. Parasites would benefit from reducing the amount of these cues before approaching the host colony. In addition, the parasites' facial pattern has been shown to reduce the host's aggressive reaction, probably by amplifying the mandibular width. We tested the occurrence of chemical and visual cheating through chemical analyses and laboratory usurpation trials, respectively. Usurping parasites did not conceal their identity by reducing cuticular hydrocarbons, nor did their facial pattern facilitate nest take-over. Contest outcome was instead predicted by the relative body size of the opponents. Fighting, rather than fooling, is therefore the strategy used by P. sulcifer usurping females. The importance of physical strength could thus explain why chemical or visual tricks do not play a role in taking over the host colony despite their potential usefulness. Our findings suggest that the evolution of sophisticated cheating mechanisms can be prevented by the ability to fight. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Longfin squid, Loligo pealeii, were exposed to two predators, bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix, and summer flounder, Paralichthys dentatus, representing cruising and ambush foraging tactics, respectively. During 35 trials, 86 predator-prey interactions were evaluated between bluefish and squid, and in 29 trials, 92 interactions were assessed between flounder and squid. With bluefish, squid predominantly used stay tactics (68.6%, 59/86) as initial responses. The most common stay response was to drop to the bottom, while showing a disruptive body pattern, and remain motionless. In 37.0% (34/92) of interactions with flounder, squid did not detect predators camouflaging on the bottom and showed no reaction prior to being attacked. Squid that did react, used flee tactics more often as initial responses (43.5%, 40/92), including flight with or without inking. When all defence behaviours were considered concurrently, flight was identified as the strongest predictor of squid survival during interactions with each predator. Squid that used flight at any time during an attack sequence had high probabilities of survival with bluefish (65%, 20/31) and flounder (51%, 18/35). The most important deimatic/protean behaviour used by squid was inking. Inking caused bluefish to startle (deimatic) and abandon attacks (probability of survival = 61%, 11/18) and caused flounder to misdirect (protean) attacks towards ink plumes rather than towards squid (probability of survival = 56%, 14/25). These are the first published laboratory experiments to evaluate the survival value of antipredator behaviours in a cephalopod. Results demonstrate that squid vary their defence tactics in response to different predators and that the effectiveness of antipredator behaviours is contingent upon the behavioural characteristics of the predator encountered.

AB Behavioural traits generally and cognitive traits in particular are relatively understudied in an evolutionary ecological context. One reason for this is that such traits are often difficult to characterize among large numbers of individuals, without the influence of diverse environmental effects swamping intrinsic individual differences. We conducted standardized assays on a natural population of great tits, Parus major, to quantify and characterize individual variation in problem-solving performance, a simple cognitive trait often linked to innovative foraging ability. Forty-four per cent of 570 birds solved a food-motivated, lever-pulling problem and this proportion was consistent across three seasons. Individual performance was consistent within and across captivity sessions, across seasons, and between two different problem-solving tasks (lever and string pulling). Problem-solving performance was not explained by differences in latency to approach the empty task, nor latency to feed after human disturbance. Variation was unrelated to body condition, while age and natal origin explained significant but minimal amounts of variation, the importance of which varied between seasons. Problem-solving performance did not covary with exploration behaviour of a novel environment, suggesting that individual differences in problem solving represent an independent source of behavioural variation in our population. Rather than simply reflecting covariance with state or with other behavioural traits, our results suggest that variation in problem-solving performance represents inherent individual differences in the propensity to forage innovatively. We suggest that standardized problem-solving assays may prove ideal for studying the evolutionary ecology of simple cognitive traits. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although sexual activity in many animal species is reduced when predation pressure intensifies, such reduction may be attenuated in accordance with age, demography or sexual competition. For example, males in lekking aggregations might forgo evasive behaviour and continue their signalling activity when exposed to predation for various reasons: the pressure to engage in signal competition with neighbours outweighs the risk of a predator attack, the per capita risk of attack is lower on larger leks, signals from neighbours within the lek mask predator cues, or limitations on general attention prevent a lekking male from simultaneously signalling and monitoring predators. We addressed the problem of balancing antipredator behaviour and signal competition in an acoustic pyralid moth, Achroia grisella, in which males gather in leks and broadcast an ultrasonic mating call. There is evidence that A. grisella can be menaced by substrate-gleaning bats and that singing males generally become silent upon perceiving bat echolocation signals or pulsed ultrasound bearing the characteristics of these signals. In this study, the incidence and duration of these silence responses were greatly reduced in lekking males compared with solitary individuals. Moreover, a moderate reduction in silence responses persisted when we broadcast, to individual males, song from a lek followed by bat echolocation stimuli. Thus, while signal masking may play a role in attenuating antipredator behaviour in lekking males, other factors, including signal competition and dilution of predation pressure, are probable influences as well.

AB Complex signals may arise through either content- or efficacy-based selection. Content-based signals are thought to evolve because of the information content they provide to the receiver. Such signals may function as multiple messages, each relaying different information or types of information. For example, some signals or signal components may indicate different aspects of condition, or condition at different life stages (quality signals), while others relay information on signaller location, or function in species recognition. Or they may act as redundant signals of overall condition, or as backup signals of the same aspect of condition. Efficacy-based signals are proposed to evolve because of the way in which they influence the production, transmission, reception or processing of the signal. We manipulated juvenile and adult condition in male Jamaican field crickets, Gryllus assimilis, to test whether changes in components of the male's long-distance acoustic mate attraction signal were consistent with content- or efficacy-based selection. Several call components exhibited condition-dependence, and may be under content- based selection. Interpulse duration, pulse rate and chirp duration appeared to honestly signal juvenile condition, while dominant frequency appeared to signal adult condition. Thus, these signal components appeared to be acting as multiple messages of quality. Pulse number, interchirp duration and chirp rate were highly stereotyped and probably function in species recognition. Call number increased with decreasing condition and was likely under efficacy-based selection. No call components appeared to have the potential to act as redundant signals. Crown Copyright (c) 2010.

AB The selective benefits of living in groups may increase with group size but this will depend on predator species or hunting mode. We tested whether the strength of selection for flock size in redshanks, Tringa totanus, depended on hunting mode used by sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus, and peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus. Sparrowhawks prefer to ambush prey from cover, whereas peregrines normally attack from the open and use aerial pursuit. The success rate of surprise attacks should always decline with group size because of vigilance effects, and so should be similar for both predators. The success rate of nonsurprise attacks should decline with group size for peregrines because confusion effects apply, but not necessarily for sparrowhawks which quickly give up their chase. Consequently, peregrines should be more likely to attack smaller flocks than sparrowhawks to minimize confusion. Observations of 895 attacks, including 120 captures, confirmed these predictions. The decline in success rate with group size was the same for both predators for surprise attacks but was seen only for peregrines for nonsurprise attacks. Sparrowhawks attacked larger flocks than peregrines, although both species attacked small flocks with similar frequency. Our results suggest that the selective benefits of group size depend both on predator type and hunting mode, we assume because of variation in the importance of vigilance and confusion, and on relative predator abundance. Changes in prey group size may then change the strength of selection on vigilance and confusion effects by altering the relative attack frequency by different predators.

   THEORY; SIZE; STRATEGIES; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; SUCCESS; CONSEQUENCES
AB Male mate choice is expected in species in which future mating opportunities of males are strongly diminished after their first copulation and mate quality is variable unless the costs of choice exceed the benefits. Males of the spider Argiope bruennichi are mostly monogynous; they damage their paired one-shot genitalia during copulation and fall victim to sexual cannibalism. Even males that are not cannibalized can achieve a maximum of two matings. Such a high mating effort implies that a male's reproductive success can be increased by selecting the best possible mate. Mate quality may depend on female mating status and/or fecundity. Males should be selected to prefer virgin females over mated ones since previously used female genital ducts can be blocked by genital mating plugs. Fecundity is a common approximation of female quality and in invertebrates is generally correlated with body size and mass. Argiope bruennichi females vary in body size and fecundity, providing a basis for male selectivity. By creating binary choice situations in field and laboratory experiments in which search costs were largely removed, we tested whether males show mate choice. There was weak evidence for a male preference based on female phenotype. However, virgin females were significantly preferred over mated females even if the virgin had a less fecund phenotype. We conclude that selective benefits of mating first with a female override potential benefits of choice based on female fecundity, leading to competition for virgin females.

AB Oviposition site selection can be viewed as an act of parental care; it is a life history trait with significant consequences for offspring development and success. Herbivorous insects may adopt different strategies for spreading their eggs (e. g. single oviposition events versus egg clustering). Host plant use results from the interplay of available cues and the responsiveness of the ovipositing female. We studied how egg-laying behaviour of individual females resulted in the egg distribution patterns observed at the population level in the ant-parasitic butterfly Maculinea alcon. Eggs are laid on marsh gentians, Gentiana pneumonanthe, but survival also depends on the presence of Myrmica host ants as young caterpillars leave the host plant and survive only after being adopted by ants. Several studies have focused on egg distribution patterns, but less so on the behavioural mechanisms behind the oviposition patterns. Our observational data show evidence for some level of egg clustering, as predicted by the obligate myrmecophilous lifestyle. There was no evidence of egg-laying avoidance when gentians already carried several eggs. Phenological time windows for oviposition on individual flower buds and gentians were much wider than reported before. Detailed tracking of egg-laying females in the field showed high rates of oviposition and suggest relatively high average levels of fecundity compared to fully herbivorous lycaenid butterflies. Results are discussed in relation to adaptive oviposition strategies of this highly specialist ant parasite of conservation concern. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Small foraging birds often rely on visual cues to detect the movement of potential threats. However, feeding in a high wind environment presents the challenge of interpreting the movements of many stimuli, most of which convey little information pertinent to survival. A bird that responds to each of these wind-driven movements would likely suffer the loss of much feeding time. Birds should thus become less responsive to moving stimuli at greater wind speeds. Furthermore, since inanimate objects should not move upwind, birds should generally be more responsive to upwind movements than typical downwind movements. By exposing passerine flocks to a moving, potentially threatening stimulus at various wind speeds, we found that these birds are in fact less responsive to stimulus movement (i.e. a lower tendency to flush to cover) as wind speed increases. However, birds were not more responsive to upwind movements of the stimulus. The propensity to flush was also not significantly affected by temperature or flock size. Responsiveness tended to decline over time, possibly indicating habituation to the stimulus, but the basic effect of wind speed held over the entire study. The general effect of wind on responsiveness suggests that the likelihood of responding to other stimuli or disturbances on windy days may also be reduced.

AB Sensory drive proposes that environmental conditions affect signalling dynamics and the evolution of signals and receivers. For visual systems, delineating the effects of lighting on mating preferences is difficult because lighting conditions can affect preferences via three mechanisms: (1) genetic differentiation in mating preferences can result from selection under different lighting conditions, (2) development under different lighting conditions can alter the visual system and presumably female mating preferences and (3) lighting conditions can immediately alter colour perception by filtering wavelengths and altering visual backgrounds. We teased apart these effects by crossing bluefin killifish within and between a spring population and a swamp population that differed in lighting environment. We divided offspring between clear and tea-stained rearing environments (developmental plasticity) and measured preference under tea and clear conditions (immediate effects). We found genetic differentiation: spring offspring showed a strong preference for red males. We also found a three-way interaction between genetics, developmental plasticity and immediate effects on preference for blue males: swamp offspring had the highest levels of preference for blue males when raised and tested under tea-stained conditions. Thus, the environment experienced during development and the immediate conditions during mate selection interact with genetics to determine preference. We also tested the sensory bias hypothesis, which predicts that mating preferences evolve as a correlated response to selection on nonmating behaviours such as foraging. The relationship between mating and foraging preferences was weak and provided little support for sensory bias. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Specialized predators must obtain all required nutrients from a single prey species. In some species nutrient balance may be possible by selecting various body parts. We tested how different ant body parts affect the fitness of a specialized ant predator and whether the predator possesses adaptations in its feeding behaviour that allow nutrient balancing while feeding on only a single prey species. We used a formicine-specialist spider, Zodarion rubidum, reared on three diet types: an entire ant, two ant gasters and two ant foreparts ( heads, thoraces and legs) of Lasius ants. Spiders grew faster, survived longer and developed earlier on the diet consisting of two ant foreparts. Spiders fed on the two ant gasters had the slowest growth, highest mortality and slowest development while spiders fed entire ants showed intermediate performance. In preference experiments, we studied the spiders' consumption of three Formicinae ant species that differ markedly in size. With small Lasius ants, spiders equally exploited the gaster and the foreparts, but with larger Formica and Camponotus ants, spiders fed significantly more on the foreparts than on the gaster. Spiders almost always fed on the gaster, suggesting that it might include beneficial nutrients. Nutritional analysis of the ant bodies of the three species revealed that there were more lipids in the gaster, while the foreparts contained more proteins. Our results suggest that ant-eating spiders might balance their nutritional needs by selectively consuming various body parts of their exclusive prey.

AB Understanding how pre- and postcopulatory sexually selected traits covary can provide insight into the evolution of male ornamentation and female mate choice. In this study, we examined ejaculate quality and investment in testicular tissue in relation to plumage colour and social status in the genetically promiscuous red-backed fairy-wren, Malurus melanocephalus. In this species, males exhibit one of three alternative reproductive phenotypes during the breeding season: males can breed in red and black plumage, breed in brown plumage, or act as brown-plumed, nonbreeding auxiliaries. We found that red/black breeders invested more heavily in spermatogenic tissue, had larger sperm reserves, and tended to have greater numbers of sperm in ejaculate samples, when compared to brown breeders and auxiliaries. Within red/black breeders, plumage redness and saturation (i.e. long wavelength hue and increased red chroma) were negatively correlated with ejaculate sample sperm density. In addition, ejaculate motility appeared to be related to variation in plumage coloration such that, overall, males with less elaborate ornamentation showed greater ejaculate quality. These results suggest that pre- and postcopulatory traits negatively covary in red/black plumed red-backed fairy-wrens and indicate a possible trade-off between investment in plumage ornaments and investment in ejaculates.

AB In aquatic environments, chemical cues released during a predator attack reliably inform prey about the presence of predation risk. Prey with information about predation risk are more successful in surviving encounters with predators than are unwary prey. To remain prepared for attack, prey should continue to monitor the status of predation risk, presenting a behavioural trade-off for prey: increased distance from areas labelled with alarm cues reduces exposure to predation risk but also reduces access to information about predation risk. In two laboratory experiments we used the presence and absence of water flow in a laboratory fluvarium to test alarm response and subsequent risk-sensitive information gathering by zebrafish (Danio rerio). In response to chemical alarm cues, fish significantly reduced activity and increased use of shelters. In the absence of flow, fish sought out the shelter nearest the cue source. In the presence of flow, fish preferred to seek shelter downstream, but not upstream, of the cue source. This allowed fish to gather information about predation risk from a relatively safe distance. In a field experiment on natural populations of stream fishes, fish avoided areas where chemical alarm cues were released (versus blank water control) but primarily because they avoided the region immediately upstream of the cue source.

AB The operational sex ratio (OSR) is thought to be a major factor influencing the intensity of mating competition and sexual selection. Even though many studies on species with conventional sex roles have shown that alterations in the OSR can either intensify male-male competition or promote female-female competitive interactions, sometimes resulting in a reversal of sex roles, it is not known how, and how quickly, individuals with reversed sex roles respond to fluctuations in this ratio. We tested for a direct influence of adult sex ratios (as a direct estimation of the OSR) on the reproductive behaviour of the sex role-reversed black striped pipefish, Syngnathus abaster. Although imbalances in the OSR effectively modulated the expression of sex roles, with males and females varying in the degree of choosiness and competitive displays, alterations in the sex ratios did not promote a similar response pattern in both sexes. A surplus of males resulted in a reversion to conventional sex roles observed when both sexes coexist in similar numbers, with males competing intensely and exhibiting a conspicuous ornament towards other males. An excess of females, in contrast, did not result in an overall increase in female competitive interactions. Only small, less attractive, females were more prone to compete as the proportion of males decreased. Large females, however, seemed to rely on their greater mating prospects, thereby avoiding the hypothetical costs of intrasexual competition.

AB Intergroup conflict occurs in many social species and involves potentially complex motivations and interactions. To understand its complexity in wild animals more fully, a comprehensive investigative approach is needed, in which the multiple resource values and measures of fighting ability that potentially influence intergroup contests are simultaneously considered and controlled for. This study uses long-term data on eight neighbouring groups of folivorous black and white colobus monkeys, Colobus guereza ('guerezas') in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to investigate the factors influencing intergroup conflict. Adult males were the main participants in intergroup aggression. Of the three resource values investigated, food value had the most unambiguous positive effect on the tendency for males to initiate high-level intergroup aggression and for groups to win. Mate value positively influenced male initiation of high-level intergroup aggression, but not more so for the group that contained high-value mates. The presence of young infants had no obvious effects. Unlike in many other species, males were more likely to initiate intergroup aggression if their groups were smaller and contained fewer adult males than opposing groups. Groups with fewer but larger adult males, and to some extent, smaller groups, were more likely to win encounters. Moreover, the relative number of adult males/group largely affected the degree to which some other factors influenced male initiation of aggression and contest outcome. These findings reveal that a complex interplay between multiple resource values and multiple fighting ability measures can simultaneously influence initiation of and success in intergroup conflict.

AB How do chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, the species with the closest evolutionary connection to humans, view faces? This study is the first to use the eye-tracking method to perform direct comparisons between humans and chimpanzees with regard to face scanning. Members of both species viewed the same sets of photographs representing conspecific and nonconspecific faces under the same experimental conditions. Chimpanzees and humans showed systematic and similar patterns of face scanning, including intensely viewing main facial features (i.e. eyes, nose and mouth) and inspecting the eyes and mouth, in that order. However, several differences between the species were also evident. For example, humans were more likely to show sequential refixations on the eye regions than were chimpanzees, whereas chimpanzees were more likely to engage in quick, vertical scanning over the eyes and mouth. Such species similarities and differences were consistent across conspecific and nonconspecific faces and were thus independent of the external morphologies of species-specific faces. Furthermore, when presented with facial expressions, chimpanzees changed their scanning patterns in response to those facial actions, whereas humans maintained intense eye viewing across the expressions. Finally, we discuss how these face-scanning patterns are related to species-specific forms of facial communication in chimpanzees and humans, and suggest that both species have unique eye movement strategies for interactions with conspecifics.

AB Predators are often unwilling to eat prey with novel appearances (so called dietary conservatism). It has repeatedly, although controversially, been argued that such wariness can contribute to the evolution of bright coloration in prey animals with effective secondary defences such as toxins. In this paper we report the results of novel evolutionary simulations in which bright prey emerge in otherwise cryptic, defended populations, and predators vary in their level of dietary wariness. A novel prediction from our simulations is that rare aposematic prey can evolve to a dynamic equilibrium with their cryptic conspecifics, and persist for long evolutionary timescales without ever reaching fixation in prey populations. Furthermore, we show that when conditions are more beneficial for new aposematic forms, for example because there are many palatable prey in a habitat, then dietary conservatism can indeed explain the evolution of aposematism, but the generality of this result was considerably restricted by variation in levels of dietary conservatism seen within predator populations and by increased predator longevity. We use the results to consider the case that 'receiver biases' could explain aposematism, rather than recently suggested models of signal reliability.

AB For group-living individuals to remain spatially coherent, coordinated behaviour across group members is essential. We investigated what factors can promote or constrain the achievement of such behavioural synchronization (measured as diversity in activities among group members) in a social primate. Two wild groups of chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, were studied in the field by instantaneous scan sampling during full-day follows to test the hypotheses that individual activity budgets, habitat constraints and group properties can all affect patterns of behavioural synchrony. Observed synchrony across individuals was variable, and analysed using a generalized linear mixed model. We found support for each of our three hypotheses. First, the probability of a group being synchronized increased with the number of pregnant females, but decreased with the number of sexually swollen females in a group. Synchrony also declined throughout the day. We interpret these two results in terms of variations in the activity budgets of both sexes related to their reproductive strategies, and changing levels of satiation among individual group members, respectively. Second, synchrony was highest in a 'closed' woodland habitat, and lowest in 'open' desert habitat. This is interpreted as a consequence of habitat differences in food patch configuration and/or predation risk. Third, we found a nonlinear relationship with increasing group cohesion, suggesting that where opportunities for information transfer are limited, behavioural synchrony may be constrained. Overall, our simple approach to quantifying behavioural synchrony highlights the role of both individual variation and the (social and ecological) environment in determining group-level patterns of behaviour.

AB Aggregations of fish around fish aggregation devices (FADs) have been widely described in the literature; most commercial catches of tuna by surface fisheries are performed around FADs, taking advantage of this behaviour. The meeting point hypothesis (MPH) suggests that fish could make use of FADs to increase the chance of encounters between conspecifics, helping individuals to form larger schools. To attempt a validation of the MPH, we performed an experiment in the field to test the following predictions: (1) fish spend more time at FADs than at any other random points and therefore aggregate around FADs, and (2) fish arrive at FADs as isolated individuals or in small groups and leave them in larger groups. Our investigation involved acoustic telemetry techniques commonly used to observe fish at FADs. The study was carried out on a small pelagic fish species, the bigeye scad, Selar crumenophthalmus, in Saint-Paul's Bay (Reunion Island). Our results validated our two predictions: FADs acted as retention points, increasing the encounter rate of fish and enhancing schooling behaviour, thereby supporting the meeting point hypothesis. FADs could be beneficial to the fitness of the associated fish, promote increased school size and hence confer the advantages of being in a larger group. The impact of the deployment of large number of FADs in some ocean regions is reinterpreted in light of our results. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Predation is one of the most important selection pressures acting on prey behaviour. While numerous studies have shown that when predation risk is high, prey tend to increase vigilance and reduce foraging effort, until recently, few studies have looked at how the temporal pattern of risk influences antipredator behaviour. The risk allocation hypothesis predicts that as predation risk fluctuates over time ( e. g. as predators come and go), the intensity of prey vigilance and foraging should depend on both the level of risk and the proportion of time that predators are present. If predators are usually absent, prey can meet their energy demands during safe periods, and thus respond strongly during the rare times when predators are present. In contrast, if predators are almost always present, prey might need to forage actively even though predators are present, a counterintuitive prediction for many behavioural ecologists. In this review, we present and highlight the paradoxical nature of the risk allocation model. We then review studies that empirically tested the model. These studies provide only mixed support for the model. Importantly, we identify factors that help to explain why some studies supported the model and others did not. In particular, we find that studies that gave prey more time to assess and learn the risk regime had a higher probability of yielding results that supported the model. Finally, we suggest extensions of the model framework to incorporate broader and more complex ecological contexts. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The connection between social status and reproductive success is contentious in many nonhuman primates, with many early studies focusing on mating success. We examined this relationship in macaques using actual paternity differences between males. We analysed data from 14 studies, representing six species and the three lineages of the genus. We found a medium-size, positive and significant association even after controlling for phylogeny ( species and lineage), spatial constraints and genetic techniques that differed between the studies. The population of macaques studied was the only factor to differ between studies and to be of important consideration for the final evaluation of the relationship. Our findings support the hypothesis that male macaques obtain advantageous reproductive output through acquisition of high social status in their groups. Even in primate groups where alternative reproductive tactics and limited control models may explain a high proportion of the reproductive skew observed, the fitness benefits derived from social status are evident and are likely to have contributed to the evolution of the complex social strati. cation found at present in these species.

AB Several quantitative models of coalition formation assume that a coalition is successful if the strength of the coalition is greater than the strength of the target, but unsuccessful otherwise. However, strong empirical evidence in favour of this hypothesis is still lacking. In this study, we provide an empirical test of this assumption in Barbary macaque males, by using a field-based estimate of individual competitive ability from which coalition strength is derived. Coalition success was determined for 90 coalitions composed of two partners and targeted at one male. Of these, 72.2% were behaviourally successful and 27.8% were unsuccessful. Asymmetry in strength was a significant predictor of coalition success, as this factor alone could explain up to 78.6% of coalition outcomes in the study group. Males behaved as if they were at least partially informed about the nature of this asymmetry. The targets of attacks by coalitions were more likely to counterattack as asymmetry in strength decreased, and coalition partners formed coalitions that produced on average a greater asymmetry in strength than would be expected by chance. However, we provide evidence that males may have used simple rules of thumb based on their knowledge of dyadic and third-party relationships, rather than estimates of asymmetry in strength per se. We conclude that competitive ability is an important factor in coalition formation in Barbary macaque males and discuss additional factors not included in this study, which may account for the unexplained outcomes.

AB Mate choice represents the outcome of a complex decision that is most often based on the integration of information on multiple traits expressed by potential mates. Multiple traits, however, can show phenotypic correlations, which may coincide with, or oppose, female preference for individual traits. Thus, if multivariate preferences are misaligned with trait covariation, variation in single traits can persist because of weakened net sexual selection. Male swordtails, Xiphophorus birchmanni, show positive covariation among three sexually dimorphic visual traits: body size, vertical bars and dorsal fin size. Using synthetic video animations, we isolated each trait and found that females preferred males with large bodies and vertical bars, but small dorsal fins, thus conflicting with male trait covariation. We then tested females using live wild-caught males and found that females preferred smaller dorsal fins on larger males. We suggest that multivariate discordance between traits and preferences results in weak sexual selection on male visual traits, and may help explain the maintenance of variation in sexually dimorphic phenotypes.

AB Aposematic animals are often conspicuous. It has been hypothesized that one function of conspicuousness in such prey is to be detected from afar by potential predators: the 'detection distance hypothesis'. The hypothesis states that predators are less prone to attack at long detection range because more time is allowed for making the 'correct' decision not to attack the unprofitable prey. The detection distance hypothesis has gained some experimental support in that time-limited predators make more mistakes. To investigate effects of prey presentation distance we performed two experiments. First, in experiment 1, we investigated at what distance chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, could see the difference in colour between aposematic and plain mealworms. Birds chose the correct track in a two-way choice when prey were at 20, 40 and 60 cm distance but not at 80 cm. Second, in experiment 2, fifth-instar larvae of the aposematic bug Lygaeus equestris were presented to experienced chicks at 2, 20 or 60 cm distance. We found no difference in attack probability between distances. However, prey mortality was significantly lower for the shortest presentation distance. In conclusion, we found no support for the hypothesis that aposematic prey benefit from long-range detection; in fact they benefit from short-distance detection. This result, and others, suggests that the conspicuousness of aposematic prey at a distance may simply be a by-product of an efficient signalling function after detection.

AB Despite theoretical predictions, dishonest signalling has rarely been observed in aggressive interactions. We present evidence of such signalling in the nonpollinating. g wasp Philotrypesis sp. A ex Ficus rubiginosa. First, morphometric data indicated that an alternative 'atypical' male morph (17.8% of individuals) exists that tends to be larger in body size and has longer mandibles for a given body size than other 'typical' males. Second, behavioural observations suggested that males use mandible gape width (which depends on mandible length) as a cue to assess opponents before fights and retreat without escalating if they are unlikely to win, and, probably because their greater mandible gape width causes more opponents to retreat without escalating, that atypical males engaged in fewer fights than typical males for a given body size but had higher mating success. Third, atypical males were less likely to win fights than typical males of similar mandible length relative to opponents. In addition, we found that atypical males incur more injuries (greater receiver-dependent signal costs) than typical males of similar body size relative to rivals. We discuss the implications of our findings for future work on dishonest signalling. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The interaction between figs and their pollinating or parasitic fig wasps is mediated largely by chemical communication. These fig wasps are often preyed upon by predatory ants. In this study, we found that predatory ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) patrolling Ficus racemosa trees were attracted to the odour from fig syconia at different developmental phases, as well as to the odours of fig wasps, whereas other predatory ants (Technomyrmex albipes) responded only to odours of syconia from which fig wasps were dispersing and to fig wasp odour. However, trophobiont-tending ants (Myrmicaria brunnea) patrolling the same trees and exposed to the same volatiles were unresponsive to fig or fig wasp odours. The predatory ants demonstrated a concentration-dependent response towards volatiles from figs receptive to pollinators and those from which wasps were dispersing while the trophobiont-tending ants were unresponsive to such odours at all concentrations. Naive predatory ants failed to respond to the volatiles to which the experienced predatory ants responded, indicating that the response to fig-related odours is learned. We suggest that predatory ants could use fig-associated volatiles to enhance their probability of wasp encounter and can eavesdrop on signals meant for pollinators.

AB Despite burgeoning interest in consistent individual differences in behaviour (animal 'personality'), the influence of social interactions on the performance of different behavioural types is poorly understood. Similarly, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of personality differences in social contexts remain unexplored. Moreover, the possibility that the sexes differ in the degree to which they exhibit personality in both social and nonsocial contexts has not yet received serious attention, despite the sexes usually being subject to differing selection pressures. Using a highly gregarious species, the zebra finch, we tested for consistent behavioural differences (in exploration) between individuals of both sexes in both nonsocial and social contexts, the latter considering the behavioural influence of opposite-sex companions. We then investigated how exploratory tendencies relate to behaviour in a potentially risky foraging context in mixed-sex dyads of individuals with differing personalities. Males were not more exploratory on average but were more consistent in their exploratory tendencies than females. Additionally, males behaved more consistently across the social and asocial contexts than females, even though individuals of both sexes similarly influenced each other's exploratory behaviour within the social context: the more exploratory the companion, the more exploratory the focal individual (relative to its level of exploration in the asocial context). An individual's exploration also affected its performance in the social foraging context. Our results stress the importance of looking for sex differences in personality and of considering the influence of social context in animal personality studies. We discuss our findings and their implications in the light of the biology of the species and set them in a broader ecological and evolutionary context.

Female kangaroos had a nonrandom social structure and we present a new methodology for analysing social structure that accounts for the amount of spatial overlap shared by pairs of female kangaroos. This simulation model showed that patterns of association among our female kangaroos were not simply those predicted by their patterns of spatial overlap. Females that associated frequently with certain associates were able to graze for longer because they were less vigilant, and thus were able to benefit from having frequent associates. Female kangaroo social structure was affected by the loss of key members of the society during a period of unusually high predation. Information-theoretical modelling showed that the factors affecting grazing behaviour changed after partial population turnover, with the strength of association between nearest neighbours having a positive effect on grazing behaviour before population turnover and group size having a positive effect on grazing behaviour after population turnover. We propose that social organization within this marsupial is more structured than previously thought. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Efficient exploitation of large-scale space is crucial to many species of animal, but the difficulties of studying how animals decide on travel routes in natural environments have hampered scientific understanding of environmental cognition. Field experiments allow researchers to define travel goals for their subjects, but practical difficulties restrict large-scale studies. In contrast, data on natural travel patterns are abundant and easy to record, but hard to interpret without circularity and subjectivity when making inferences about when and why an animal began heading to a particular location. We present a method of determining objectively the point at which an animal's travel path becomes directed at a location, for instance a distant feeding site, based on the statistical characteristics of its route. We evaluate this method and illustrate how it can be tailored to particular problems, using data that are (1) synthetic, (2) from chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, where travel is from a single sleeping site in an overlapping home range, and (3) from chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, where sleeping sites are unlimited within a large territory. We suggest that this 'change-point test' might usefully become a routine first step in interpreting the decision making behind animal travel under natural conditions.

AB A potentially painful experience may modify normal behavioural responses. To gauge the importance of pain relative to predation or social status, we presented competing stimuli, a predator cue or an unfamiliar social group, to two groups of noxiously treated rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. In the predator cue experiment,fish were classified as bold or shy. Noxiously stimulated fish did not show antipredator responses, suggesting that pain is the imperative. In the social status experiment, noxiously stimulated fish held individually and undisturbed showed an increase in respiration rate and plasma cortisol. As a comparison, we used the dominant or subordinate fish in a group as the noxiously stimulated fish. After the noxious treatment, we returned this test fish to a familiar or unfamiliar social group. Neither dominants nor subordinates showed a negative change in physiology compared to their controls. However, in a familiar group the dominant was much less aggressive, suggesting a behavioural impairment in response to noxious stimulation. In an unfamiliar group, no reduction of aggression was seen, suggesting that maintaining dominance status took priority over showing signs of pain. These findings may reflect an ability to prioritize motivational drivers in fish, and as such provides evidence for central processing of pain rather than merely showing a nociceptive re. ex.

AB Social insects that have secondarily lost the worker caste are the ultimate social parasite; they allocate their energy to sexual production and, thus, rely completely on the host for survival. Most inquiline species are rare, and little is known about their life histories except that they are completed within the host colony. Here we report intracolonial dynamics of the workerless inquiline, Temnothorax minutissimus, which parasitizes T. curvispinosus in eastern North America, and examine cuticular chemicals that may be important for inquiline integration into host society (nestmate recognition) as well as reproductive dominance. We found that autumn colonies frequently contained multiple inquilines, of which only one or two were reproductively dominant and groomed the dorsal side of the host queen's head. Inquilines on the nest periphery or that roamed the foraging arena were young gynes that had not yet dispersed. A large proportion of inquilines were inseminated, but only a few showed evidence of reproduction, none of which were peripheral inquilines. Inquilines differed chemically from one another with respect to behaviour and ovarian development. Groomers resembled host queens chemically and had greater quantities of cuticular chemicals than did peripheral inquilines. Host queens differed little in cuticular chemistry regardless of inquiline attention. Our findings suggest an association between inquiline cuticular chemistry and behavioural activities that reflects ovarian activity. These differences suggest a dual-chemical strategy of inquilines to reside in the host colony: reproductive inquilines mimic the host queen, whereas dispersers maintain a neutral chemical signature.

AB The colours of male coenagrionid damselflies have been interpreted by some as intraspecific signals that reduce intrasexual harassment by advertising the unprofitability of pursuing conspecific males as potential mates. As visual cues, male colours should be conspicuous to other males under the specific light environments where males search for females. We tested this prediction by using spectroradiometry and two models of damselfly colour vision to determine the chromatic and achromatic contrast of males from six species of Enallagma damselflies with pond backgrounds under the ambient light conditions when each species was most active. The males of five species were active at the time when their colour was most conspicuous against aquatic vegetation. Three blue species were most active and attained their highest levels of contrast during midday, while species that became active in late afternoon or evening reflected longer wavelengths and increased in brightness contrast under low sun angles. A sixth species, Enallagma pictum, departed from this pattern. We propose that colour may serve as a signal of both sexual and species identity among males.

AB The degree of sociality during an animal's life changes as it modulates its behaviour to reflect different life stages. Only a few species of mammal undergo a period of adolescence, but for these species it is probably one of their most important life stages. It is when individuals acquire skills and develop relationships that are of both immediate and long-term benefit to their survival and reproductive success, particularly in polygynous males in which sexual selection favours size and dominance. We collected focal and observational data on male African elephants in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, to assess behaviour and social interactions during adolescence. Adolescent males (10-15 and 16-20 years of age) were the most sociable age group, showing preferences for larger social groupings and being in closer proximity to other elephants; later adolescent males (ages 16-20) showed a tendency for higher social levels. Males of all ages preferred to have males >= 36 years of age as their nearest neighbour. We argue that this proximity to older males provides opportunities for males to learn from more experienced individuals. It has long been recognized that matriarchs are the repositories of social and ecological knowledge within elephant breeding herds: we suggest that mature males are reservoirs for such knowledge within bull society. 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Baylis (1982, Acoustic Communication in Birds, Academic Press) decried the serious lack of experimental veri. cation for the various hypotheses proposed to explain vocal mimicry in songbirds. With few exceptions, our understanding of the function and acquisition of this fascinating behaviour seems to have scarcely progressed. We examine the proposed functional explanations and supporting evidence, and summarize advances made since Baylis's (1982) review. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence to support any of the functional hypotheses but, rather, that almost all of the data concerning song mimicry are consistent with the learning mistakes hypothesis, whereby birds learn simple and common sounds, frequently using them in inappropriate contexts. Additionally, many apparently mimicked sounds are calls, not songs, which themselves may not be learned by the models. It is plausible that many examples of call mimicry are, in fact, due to evolutionary convergence. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Most studies of female choice have assumed that mating preferences are shared within a population or species. However, variation both within and among females exists in natural populations, and foraging history is among the many ways in which females may vary. Here, we used diet manipulations in an effort to understand how foraging history influences female mate choice. Immature Schizocosa wolf spiders collected from a mixed population of brush-legged and non-ornamented males were reared in the laboratory on two diets that varied in both quality and quantity (low/high diet). For low-and high-diet individuals, we recorded data on rates of development, adult size and adult mate choice. Consistent with previous work, we found that high-diet spiders matured more quickly and were significantly larger as adults than low-diet spiders. Males also matured earlier than females. Body condition varied with diet treatment and sex. High-diet individuals and females were both characterized by better body condition indexes. In addition, high-diet brush-legged males had larger brushes than low-diet brush-legged males. Upon maturation, females were paired simultaneously with a low-and a high-diet male of the same form (brush-legged or non-ornamented) in a mate choice trial. While no obvious differences were observed in courtship and/or mating effort between males, female mate choice varied with the female's diet treatment. High-diet females mated more frequently with high-diet males than with low-diet males, whereas low-diet females showed no selectivity. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Newborn rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, discriminate between different categories of adult conspecifics on the basis of their abdominal odour cues. Whether these cues can support the development of filial preferences has not been adequately tested. Using a two-choice paradigm, we assessed the ability of 3-8- day- old pups to orient selectively to the mother versus an unfamiliar female, either spontaneously or after odour conditioning. In experiment 1, nonconditioned pups roamed indifferently over the mother and an unfamiliar female. In experiment 2, pups conditioned to a neutral odorant while nursing or with the mammary pheromone became attracted by the odorant. In experiment 3, pups that had learned the odorant while nursing oriented for longer to any female carrying it, but the unscented mother and a scented unfamiliar female were equally attractive. Finally, in experiment 4, pups that had learned the odorant paired with the mammary pheromone showed a preference for their scented mother, but not systematically for a scented unfamiliar female; furthermore, they were equally attracted by the unscented mother and a scented unfamiliar female. In sum, pups did not spontaneously evince an olfactory preference for the mother when opposed to an unfamiliar female, although they seemed able to detect individual maternal odours. In fact, they appeared to react to both species-specific cues and individual cues that they had learned, and their responses depended on their degree of familiarity with the cues and on the context. The mammary pheromone by itself might act as both a releasing and a reinforcing signal in these early socially oriented behaviours. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Richardson's ground squirrels produce alarm calls that warn conspecifics of potential predatory threat. Variation in the acoustic structure of individual syllables within a call carries information regarding the extent of threat. Given this variation, along with the production of multiple syllables within a repeated call, the syntactical structure of the call could also encode meaningful information. To test for evidence of syntax in Richardson's ground squirrel alarm communication, we presented adult and juvenile subjects with repeated alarm calls with unaltered syllable order and those same calls with syllable order randomized. There was limited evidence that syllable order affected receiver response, but squirrels were more responsive to primary syllables of repeated calls even when these syllables were embedded within randomized calls. This suggests that primary syllables serve a general alerting function, possibly priming receivers for information that follows. Distinctive structural elements of primary syllables, including reduced syllable duration and reduced harmonic durations relative to the fundamental frequency, were correlated with the heightened vigilance responses that these syllables evoked.

AB To determine whether animals assess each other's fighting ability in contests, researchers usually regress contest duration over the sizes of the contestants. The predominant trend in recent studies is for the contest duration to correlate positively with the size of the smaller opponent but to have no obvious relationship with the size of the larger opponent. This indicates that animals make contest decisions based on their own abilities (`self assessment') and displaces the once-popular belief that they assess their opponents (`mutual assessment'). These tests, however, are based on the implicit but never stated assumption that animals adopt only one assessment approach throughout an entire contest. By examining the contest behaviours of a killifish, we show that (1) the fish adopt mutual assessment at earlier stages when deciding whether to escalate the contest from the mutual display to the attack phase and (2) once a contest is escalated, the fish switch to self assessment to decide how long to escalate. Our results show that individuals may adopt multiple assessment approaches in one contest; contest behaviours in different stages (where applicable) of a contest should be analysed separately to better elucidate animal contest assessment strategies.

AB If larger groups are discovered ( and thus attacked) by predators more often, the benefits of group living can be reduced or even cancelled. Thus, the relationship between group size and detection rate is critical in assessing risk to prey individuals. Three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus L., predating Daphnia magna were used to assess this relationship, with time taken to approach prey as a proxy for detection rate. In a field experiment, a group of 100 Daphnia was approached and attacked more rapidly than a group of two. In addition, the time to approach prey was found to be inversely proportional to group size ( range 2-50 Daphnia) under laboratory conditions. Multiple groups of the same size ( 2 or 30) were then presented to determine the effect of group number on approach time. Time to approach the prey was significantly reduced compared to that when these group sizes were presented alone. This effect of group number suggests that the asymptote observed in the relationship between group size and approach time was limited by encounter rate with the prey group. There was no significant interaction between group size and number, suggesting that prey encounter ( number of groups) and prey detection ( group size) acted independently in reducing approach time. In a final experiment, it was demonstrated that the visual angle produced by the prey group could account for the greater detection of larger groups.

AB It is crucial for nectar-feeding animals to re-locate profitable flowers. However, neither flower shape nor colour signal the nectar content of a single flower. Such information can emerge only by an animal remembering experienced foraging profitability furthermore, this requires the ability to spatially discriminate between individual flowers of similar appearance, which appears to be demanding especially when multiple flowers of the same species are aggregated. In a study of the foraging behaviour of nectar-feeding bats, Glossophaga soricina, we investigated the effect of local echo acoustic cues that were spatially separated by at least 40 cm from the goal in a multiple goal-finding task. Increasing density of local spatial cues improved accuracy in re-locating rewarding feeders by helping bats identify profitable flowers on a small scale.

AB The ecological constraints model (ECM) was formulated to predict how different ecological factors affect cooperative-breeding vertebrates. Within these groups some individuals help raise nondescendent young because of constraints that limit their own reproduction (e.g. limited foods, reproductive opportunities and nesting sites). Despite similarities between cooperative-breeding vertebrates and facultatively social insects, few studies have explicitly and experimentally determined how the ECM applies to social insects. In this study, we examined the potential effects of predation, density and nest site limitation as well as differences in nest site quality on the alternative nesting tactics of the paper wasp Mischocyttarus mexicanus. Accurate field estimates of density were possible because multiple nests are initiated in isolated Sabal palmetto trees. Results from a 17-month census showed more solitary nesting when density was low and nest sites were plentiful. In addition, females appeared to prefer nests initiated on unoccupied east-facing fronds. We then examined the potential effect of density and nest site limitation in a field experiment by adding or removing fronds from S. palmetto and forcing all females to renest. The percentage of haplometrotic females decreased when fronds were removed (increased density treatment), increased when fronds were added (decreased density treatment), and showed a mixed response when frond number remained unchanged (control density treatment). Nest site limitation did not appear to affect renesting females: the percentage of available unoccupied fronds was not affected by treatment. Mischocyttarus mexicanus females responded primarily to their social environment within palm groves and to variation in nest site quality, instead of constraints that typically affect cooperative-breeding vertebrates.

AB Many ambush foraging predators possess specialized structures and behaviours that plausibly function to attract prey, but this hypothesis has rarely been subject to direct empirical tests. If luring evolved to attract specific prey types then we predict that it will be manifested only if that prey type is present, and only by predators of the size class that feed on that prey type. Also, luring should induce closer approach by prey; and aspects of the behaviour (e. g. frequency of movement of the lure) should have been. ne tuned by selection to induce maximal response from prey. We describe a novel luring system: small- and medium-sized ( but not metamorph and large) cane toads, Chaunus marinus, wave the long middle toe of the hind-foot up and down in an obvious display. In keeping with the functional hypothesis, toe waving is elicited by moving edible-sized objects such as crickets or metamorphic toads. Metamorphic toads are attracted to this stimulus, and trials with a mechanical model show that both the colour and the vibrational frequency of the toe correspond closely with those most effective at attracting smaller conspecifics towards the lure. The independent evolution of visual luring systems in many animal lineages provides a powerful opportunity for robust empirical tests of adaptive hypotheses about signal design.

AB Variation in sex ratio can affect mating behaviour, with more intense competition predicted at biased sex ratios. In species with alternative mating behaviours, sex ratio variation can induce switches between behaviour types and this, together with the consistency with which behaviours are expressed, may also affect the intensity of sexual selection. All these factors can be combined to elucidate individual mating behaviour profiles. The establishment of individual behavioural profiles for male mating behaviour in one species, the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, is the focus of this study; specifically, we ask whether individual male mating behaviour profiles show that males have consistent reproductive behaviour across contexts where the advantages of using alternative mating tactics differ. The frequency of both sneak mating and display behaviours varied between sex ratios. Male display and sneak frequency were highly repeatable and males maintained consistent rankings of behaviour under equal, male- and female-biased sex ratios. We conclude, therefore, that male guppies have individual mating behaviour profiles. The use of behavioural profiles fills a gap in the existing literature by allowing behaviours that are functionally related but not correlated, such as alternative mating behaviours, to be treated as an integrated unit.

AB Animals that undergo a habitat shift face a number of challenges as they move between habitats; for example, they may encounter new predator species and may be vulnerable as they adapt to their new surroundings. An ability to adapt quickly to the new environment is likely to influence post-transition survival, and an understanding of the development of this ability is important in species that we rear for conservation and reintroduction programmes. Juvenile cod, Gadus morhua, undergo a habitat shift during their development, and they are also a species where reintroduction work has been tried. Here, we describe an experiment that investigated the effects that rearing environment has on cod shoaling behaviour. Cod were tested just after they had undergone the transition from a pelagic to a more benthic existence. We found that cod reared in either an enriched or in a plain, standard hatchery environment differed in terms of their shoaling responses; the shoaling tendency of fish reared in enriched tanks varied between testing environments, but fish reared in plain environments responded in the same way across the testing conditions. We discuss the influence of early experience on the development of appropriate behavioural responses and the importance of this for captive-reared species that are released into the wild.

AB We used 44 months of radiotelemetry data to investigate the selection of feeding habitats by leopards in Phinda Private Game Reserve, South Africa. We assessed whether leopards hunted in certain habitats disproportionately to their availability and we investigated the factors influencing selection of feeding habitats. We also compared the number of kills and relative success rates of observed hunts in different vegetation types with available prey biomass and the degree of cover within each habitat. Leopards preferred hunting in habitats where prey was easier to catch rather than where prey was more abundant. However, in contrast to expectations, the apparent 'catchability' of prey was not proportional to the amount of cover provided by each habitat type. Instead, the probability of a kill occurring was greater in areas with intermediate cover levels, and these habitat types were favoured by leopards for hunting. There was no significant difference in the success rates of observed hunts in different habitats, suggesting that reduced detectability of prey in denser vegetation was the principal factor governing the decreased occurrence of kills there. Kleptoparasitism was relatively uncommon at Phinda, and there was no significant difference in the number of kills lost to other predators, or the likelihood of a carcass being hoisted in different vegetation types. Our results suggest that leopards are not 'supergeneralists' as widely portrayed and, at least in their choice of hunting habitat, show a degree of specialization that is previously undocumented. We suggest this is likely to influence local population densities and resilience to threats, and we discuss the need for fine-scale understanding of the species' ecological requirements in planning for its conservation.

AB Reproductive behaviours such as courting, copulation, parental care and mate guarding often entail a cost of increased predation risk, either to the individual itself or to the offspring under its care. Because of this, males of several species reduce courting effort in the presence of a predator. The degree to which reproduction is curtailed may depend upon the magnitude of potential benefits as well as the current and previous reproductive success of the male. We presented male bicolour damselfish, Stegastes partitus, with females in the presence and absence of fish and egg predators and tracked the realized fecundity of the males over the course of a spawning cycle to evaluate the degree to which courting reductions depend on the size of the female being courted, the type of predator involved and the previous and current mating success. We found that males increased courting towards larger females and that this courting was reduced in the presence of a fish or an egg predator for small females but not for large ones. We found no relationship between courting reduction and either past or current reproductive success for the fish or egg predator treatments, respectively. Our results demonstrate that male S. partitus do show context-dependent courting behaviour and seem to balance risk and reward in courting decisions.

AB The evolutionary stability of social cooperation requires altruistic acts to be directed mainly towards related individuals. To maintain significant intragroup relatedness, social insects have evolved sophisticated recognition systems. We compared nestmate recognition abilities of three native European species of the ant genus Temnothorax in relation to variation in cuticular chemicals and intraspecific genetic diversity. Colony take-over and fusions are common in two sibling species T. nylanderi and T. crassispinus, but rare in T. unifasciatus, suggesting relatively in effecient nestmate recognition in the former species. Temnothorax nylanderi and T. crassispinus discriminated less effectively between nestmates and non-nestmates than T. unifasciatus. While chemical pro. les of different colonies strongly overlapped in T. crassispinus and T. nylanderi, 97% of all T. unifasciatus samples were, in a discriminant analysis, correctly assigned to their respective colony. Chemical distances between colonies correlated with aggression levels in T. unifasciatus, but not in the other two species. Finally, preliminary genetic results indicated that haplotype divergence within T. nylanderi and T. crassispinus is remarkably low, whereas T. unifasciatus and other congeners are genetically more variable. In theory, loss of genetic variation, including depletion at loci involved in the production of cuticular hydrocarbons, could decrease colony recognition effeciency. We suggest that this might be the case in T. nylanderi and T. crassispinus, leading to colony fusions in the field. Despite their different life histories, these native species show similarities to invasive ants where genetic bottlenecks arising from founder effects are thought to result in a loss of colony boundaries.

AB Vocal communication is of special importance in mother-offspring interactions in many precocial mammals, where the offspring are highly mobile. Newborn guinea pigs, Cavia aperea f. porcellus, make distinct calls when separated from their mother. Assuming that offspring separation calls are important in mother-offspring communication, we predicted guinea pig females would respond more strongly to calls of their own than to calls from unfamiliar pups or other guinea pig calls and would respond to pup calls only during lactation when responses are adaptive. In playback experiments, we tested lactating females' responses to separation calls from their own pups and from unfamiliar pups and to female contact calls. We also tested responses by females in late pregnancy (days 50-60) to separation pup calls. Lactating females responded with significantly more vocalizations to their own and to unfamiliar pup calls than to control sounds. Mothers also responded significantly more strongly to playback of calls from their own pups than to calls from unfamiliar pups, suggesting that mothers are able to use vocal cues in pup recognition. The reproductive state significantly influenced responses: lactating females always responded to pup calls, whereas pregnant females did not respond, suggesting that responsiveness is state dependent.

AB A variety of odorants attract Drosophila larvae, although this behaviour can be modulated by experience. For instance, larvae pre-exposed to an attractive odorant may subsequently display less attraction towards the same compound. In previous reports, this phenomenon has been interpreted as a drop in olfactory sensitivity, caused by sensory adaptation. We tried to elucidate the basis of this behavioural modification by pre-exposing larvae to various odours. After multiple pre-exposure cycles larvae were repulsed by initially attractive odours, and pre-exposure did not change the threshold concentration driving a behavioural response. We therefore believe that sensitivity to the odorant was only slightly affected in our protocol. Our results thus do not support the previous interpretation and rather suggest that olfactory pre-exposure induces a change in the hedonic value of the odour. Although we did not succeed in elucidating the exact nature of the underlying mechanism, we can reject an association of the odour with the absence of food as an interpretation of the observed behavioural changes; this is because addition of food did not abolish the repulsion to the pre-exposed odour. In addition to ruling out previous interpretations of odour pre-exposure effects, this study stresses the complexity of Drosophila larval behaviour.

AB In species where males form cooperative alliances for the purposes of reproduction, there may be considerable variation in the strength and size of alliances observed within one population. Male lance-tailed manakins, Chiroxiphia lanceolata, form long-term cooperative alliances to court females on group-occupied display areas. I investigated male status and alliance structure in a colour-banded population. Each display area was a group territory attended by multiple adult and subadult males. Alpha males were present at display areas more often than other males, performed solo courtship displays for females, and vocalized distinctively in paired displays. Alpha-beta pairs had high duetting association index values and performed two types of paired courtship displays for females. I combined these characteristics in a predictive logistic regression model to assess male status probabilistically when not all key behaviours were observed. Typically, one alpha and one beta male occupied each display area, but males also formed multiple alliances (one alpha paired with multiple high-ranking subordinates) or were solitary, with no distinct alliances. Both alliances and solitary alphas attracted females for courtship displays. Alphas were generally older than their beta partners, but age did not absolutely predict status. Individual alpha males were involved in different alliance types in different years, showing that alliance variation is not the result of fixed differences in individual strategies. Instead, variation apparently results from changing opportunities for partnership formation and territory acquisition. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Conspecific ant colonies are often overdispersed, i.e. they are further apart than they would be if they were distributed randomly. This overdispersion might be driven by competition for food resources or nest sites and may result from established colonies preventing incipient colonies from settling too close to them. We investigated another possible mechanism for overdispersion: active nest choice by emigrating colonies. Colonies may be influenced by the presence of conspecifics when they are emigrating from a nest that has become uninhabitable. In the laboratory, we presented Temnothorax albipennis ant colonies with a choice of three new nests, which were equidistant from their old nest site. The new nests were identical except that one was near to an established conspecific colony. The emigrating colonies significantly preferred the new nest site that was furthest from the resident colony. This selection was not just the result of access to the other nests being blocked by aggression from the resident colony; emigrating colonies thus made active choices. Odour cues may influence nest selection: odours left around nest sites by foreign colonies deterred nest occupancy. There was more aggression near the resident colony, but this appeared to be caused by the greater density of resident ants there rather than those ants being more aggressive per capita. We also observed a relatively high proportion of fusions between colonies. Possible reasons for this are considered together with their implications.

AB High genetic similarity or dissimilarity between parents may result in viability consequences for offspring. However, because female choice of a social mate often reflects access to resources or male parental care, optimal genetic complementarity may be unattainable for social pairs. Thus, extrapair copulations may serve to increase offspring viability by allowing females to obtain sperm from males with more compatible genomes than those of social mates. We investigated whether parental genetic similarity influences offspring viability, including immunocompetence, in house sparrows, Passer domesticus. We also explored whether genetic similarity of social mates predicts the prevalence of young sired through extrapair fertilizations, and whether females enhance offspring viability by engaging in extrapair matings. We used DNA fingerprinting to estimate genetic similarity between social mates, and we assessed offspring viability using two measures of nestling immune response, the phytohaemagglutinin skin test and heterophil:lymphocyte ratios, plus nestling body mass and hatching success. We found no associations between the genetic similarity of parents and offspring immunocompetence, mass or hatching success; however, parental genetic similarity was positively correlated with clutch size. Genetic similarity of social mates also did not predict the frequency of extrapair young. Furthermore, maternal half-siblings within broods of mixed paternity did not differ in immunocompetence. Thus, our results provide no evidence for enhancement of offspring viability as an incentive for female engagement in extrapair copulations.

AB Antipredator vigilance decreases with group size in many vertebrate prey species. This pattern might be explained by collective detection (increased probability of observing a predator) or risk dilution (decreased likelihood of being captured with larger group size). If dilution is the main cause of the group-size effect, nearest-neighbour distances and distance to the edge of the group would affect vigilance, and alarm calling and factors that affect hearing alarm calls would not affect vigilance. The opposite outcomes are expected if detection is the primary influence. We used both model fitting and hypothesis testing to determine which mechanism had the greater effect, using 14 populations of Columbian ground squirrels, Spermophihis columbianus. Vigilance decreased significantly with increases in group size (R-2 = 0.70, P = 0.0002). Model fitting revealed that the detection model was a statistically good fit to our data and the dilution model was not. We found no significant effect of nearest-neighbour distance on the proportion of time vigilant. Distance of individuals to the edge of the meadow habitat had a marginally significant effect on vigilance in one analysis, but no significant effect in three other analyses. Alarm calls occurred in 56.1% of observations and had a significant effect on vigilance. Wind speed did not show a significant effect on proportion of time vigilant during foraging bouts (mixed models: F = 2.41, P = 0.12), but squirrels were observed to forage less in high wind. All of these results support the detection hypothesis. Group type and means of information transfer about predators may be indicators of which mechanism, detection or dilution, has the greatest influence on the group-size effect on vigilance.

Based on a habituation-discrimination paradigm previously used with this species to show individual recognition of their long calls, subjects showed the ability to distinguish individuals by their alarm calls alone. Once subjects habituated to multiple exemplars of one individual's alarm call, their response was renewed to the alarm calls of another individual but not to a new set of alarm calls from the same individual. We discuss the implications of these results for current theories of signal processing. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prey often face a behavioural trade-off between fitness-related activities and costly predator avoidance. Individuals that are able to assess their level of risk should maximize their fitness by allocating appropriate amounts of time and energy to avoid predators. The threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis states that prey should respond to a given threat with an intensity that matches their level of risk. Prey fish are known to assess predation risk using predator odours. However, the level of sophistication of risk assessment based on predator odours is not well understood. We conducted two experiments to investigate whether fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, assess proximity and density of pike, Esox lucius, predators based on pike odours. In experiment 1, we exposed pike-experienced minnows to either 60 ml of pike odour from 12 pike (i.e. 5 ml/pike), 60 ml of pike odour from two pike (i.e. 30 ml/pike) or a control of 60 ml of water. Minnows exposed to odours from two pike showed a more intense antipredator response than did minnows exposed to odours from 12 pike, demonstrating that minnows can detect individual pike in a mixture of odours from several pike. The fact that minnows responded with a greater intensity as the per-pike concentration increased while the overall concentration of pike odour remained constant, indicates that minnows can use odours to determine their relative proximity to predators. In experiment 2, we exposed pike-experienced minnows to either 5 ml/pike from each of 12 pike, 5 ml/pike from each of two pike or a water control. Minnows in the 12-pike treatment showed a stronger antipredator response than did minnows in the two-pike treatment, demonstrating that minnows can assess the relative density of predators using predator odours. These results demonstrate an amazing level of sophistication of predator odour assessment; they are the first to show that prey fish can use odours to determine predator proximity and relative density to respond to predators in a threat-sensitive manner.

AB Our objective was to determine which survival skills were most informative of larval fish's escape potential, and thereby better understand larval fish strategies for predator evasion and the nature of selective pressures during early life. We examined evasive performance of red drum larvae, Sciaenops ocellatus, in predation trials and related their escape potential to 12 putative survival skills measured in nonlethal assays. The putative survival skills measured were spontaneous swimming speed and the responsiveness, timing and magnitude of escape responses elicited by artificial stimuli. Responsiveness to the predator was the primary determinant of success in predation trials, accounting for 86% of the variation in escape potential. Of 12 putative survival skills and composite variables that summarized all putative skills, only visual responsiveness (proportion of stimulus presentations responded to) was significantly correlated with escape potential. Regression tree analysis showed that three putative survival skills could be applied in sequence to coarsely filter larvae according to escape potential. Previous work showed that batches of larvae (spawns) could be grouped into clusters whose members showed similar levels of performance in most putative skills. Predation trials showed that escape potential varied as predicted by these clusters. Our results imply that some putative survival skills measured in nonlethal assays reflect responsiveness to an actual predator, but they do not relate directly to their analogues in actual predator-prey interactions. Nevertheless, the ability to distinguish unlikely survivors from more fit individuals, even coarsely, can be valuable for designing experiments, and careful interpretation of putative survival skills can improve ecological models designed to project the fate of larval cohorts.

AB We used satellite-tracking data from repeated journeys between Europe and West Africa by the same osprey, Pandion haliaetus, individuals to test whether the timing of migration differs between spring and autumn and whether landmarks and stopover goal areas are important for navigation. The timing of migration varied more in autumn than in spring, owing to significant differences between individuals (related to sex) in autumn migration dates. Autumn journeys were significantly slower than spring journeys because they included more stopover days. The difference may be explained by environmental conditions restricting the timing of migration in spring, by differences in opportunities to deposit fuel prior to departure, and by differences in expected changes in foraging/fuelling conditions along the route. Flight paths from repeated journeys by the same individual were often 120-405 km apart (maximum east-west separation 1400 km). These distances exceed the expected normal range of vision, suggesting that the ospreys did not find their way by following familiar landmarks. Flight paths converged in some regions, indicating the existence of up to three intermediary goal areas along the route of individual birds. Between these goal regions route fidelity was low, and the ospreys could find the next goal region after extensive deviation, presumably by map-based navigation and possibly in combination with path integration.

AB In theory, females that can afford to do so may increase their fitness by investing in offspring of the sex with the greater probability of attaining high reproductive success. This has been observed in a wide variety of mammalian, reptilian and avian species although the proximate mechanism remains a mystery. Using a captive population of peafowl, Pavo cristatus, we investigated the relation between maternal quality, offspring sex ratio and plasma concentrations of the reproductive hormones testosterone and 17 beta-oestradiol and the principal avian stress hormone corticosterone. Each peacock was paired with three peahens that differed with respect to their relative body condition, creating a condition and dominance hierarchy within each pen and thus a situation in which we would predict investment in offspring to vary between hens. We found significant intercorrelations between maternal body condition (but not dominance rank or clutch size), maternal plasma levels of corticosterone and testosterone (but not 17 beta-oestradiol) and clutch sex ratio, such that good maternal condition, low plasma corticosterone and high levels of testosterone were associated with male biases in the sex ratio and increased investment in male eggs. The observed biases were probably present at laying, and thus add to the growing number of studies showing primary sex ratio adjustment in response to maternal body condition, and furthermore may indicate a role for corticosterone and testosterone in the avian sex manipulation process.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID MATING TACTICS; EVOLUTION
AB Intense sexual selection leading to male fighting in fig wasps is extensively documented and has evolved independently in several lineages of nonpollinating and pollinating fig wasps. We studied wingless males of nonpollinating Idarnes fig wasps, and observed assessment display and defensive behaviour (mating inside the female galls and sheltering within empty galls) during the mating period, in opposition to reported indications that such behaviour does not play an important role in the avoidance of fatal combats in fig wasps. Compared to males of other species with similar morphology and future reproductive opportunities, males of these species generally showed lower scores of physical injuries due to aggressive confrontations. Our results are consistent with models of asymmetric contest competition, and suggest that defensive behaviour and particular internal features of figs may increase the importance of the recognition of competitive asymmetries in reducing the severity of fighting in closed systems.

   BEHAVIOR; ANIMALS; PIGEONS; DELAY; PERCEPTION
AB An important aspect of cognition is whether animals live exclusively in the present or can anticipate the future. Defined as self-control, the ability to choose a large, remote reinforcer over a small, proximate reinforcer available at the same frequency has been examined in a number of species, often proving difficult to demonstrate. We investigated self-control for food in domestic fowl using a standard two-key operant task and an equivalent two-choice return maze (TCRM) task. When hens chose between a 2-s delay to a 3-s feed access (impulsive) and a 6-s delay to a 7-s feed access (self-control), they appeared unable to discriminate in the TCRM but were impulsive in the operant task. We explored reasons for not choosing self-control in the operant task, first by examining the relation between feed access time and actual feed intake. A second operant experiment examined whether failure to show self-control could be attributed to an inability to combine the delay and access (quantity) reward information associated with choices to reach overall predictions of value. New hens chose between a 2-s delay to a 3-s feed access (impulsive) and either a 22-s delay to a 22-s feed access (standard self-control) or a 6-s delay to a 22-s feed access (jackpot self-control). While hens were impulsive in the standard condition, they showed significant and pronounced self-control in the jackpot condition, eliminating the possibility of an absolute cognitive constraint. Impulsive behaviour can instead be explained by temporal discounting: perceived depreciation of reward value as a function of the uncertainty associated with delay. Implications for welfare are discussed. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acadian flycatchers, Ernpidonax virescens, like many other tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), sing complex songs with little variation among individuals. Measurements of frequency and timing revealed that individuals' songs included consistent but slight individual differences. A comparison of differences between songs of territorial neighbours and between more distant males revealed no evidence that neighbours learn the features of each other's songs. Playbacks of neighbours' and strangers' songs for 30 min at predetermined distances from singing subjects provided marginal evidence that territorial birds recognize these differences. Playbacks for only 2 min provided no such evidence, although similar experiments with hooded warblers, Wilsonia citrina, and Kentucky warblers, Oporornis formosa, in the same forest had provided clear evidence for recognition of individual neighbours. The slight differences in individuals' songs and the degradation of songs during propagation in a forest must make this discrimination difficult for Acadian flycatchers. In tyrant flycatchers, complex songs with innate developmental constraints might evolve by sexual selection for species recognition despite disadvantages for individual recognition.

AB The tendency in primate groups for two opponents to affiliate shortly after a fight has been described as dyadic reconciliation. The response has been shown to restore disrupted relationships and curtail ongoing aggression. Rates of self-directed behaviour (e.g. scratching) are positively correlated with anxiety in primates and the rates decline after reconciliation, indicating that the response also functions to reduce postconflict tension. Third parties not involved in an aggressive interaction are also likely to affiliate with one of the combatants subsequent to a fight. Such 'triadic' interactions may also promote conflict resolution when, for instance, the relatives of a victim affiliate with their relative's aggressor. Because aggression in a group influences a bystander's behaviour with combatants, we hypothesized that aggression between two animals would also influence a bystander's behaviour with other bystanders. Such 'quadratic' postconflict interactions might also function to reduce postconflict tension or occur in patterns among kin subgroups to resolve conflict. We tested for quadratic interactions in an 18-member group of captive hamadryas baboons, Papio hamadryas hamadryas. Immediately following a fight, an uninvolved bystander was randomly selected for observation and its affiliative interactions with other bystanders and its displacement activities were recorded for 3 min. Rates of behaviour during these postconflict periods were compared to rates during 3-min baseline periods not preceded by aggression. Bystanders engaged in quadratic interactions by increasing affiliation with other bystanders following aggression. Bystanders directed affiliation to nonkin bystanders that were their preferred social partners. Displacement activities of bystanders were significantly higher during postconflict intervals compared to baseline intervals, and bystander displacement activity levels before affiliative contact with other bystanders were significantly higher than after contact. Apparently, bystanders become tense,or anxious after witnessing aggression and affiliate with preferred partners to reduce the arousal. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The way in which female mate choice, scramble competition and contest competition for mates interact to influence the evolution of male traits is poorly understood. We tested female preferences for males that varied in spatial ability and aggressiveness, traits likely to be selected by scramble and contest competition, respectively. Male meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, were tested for their spatial ability using a series of water maze tests, and their aggressiveness was determined using paired arena trials. Females were given a choice between two tethered males, and their preferences were scored based on relative frequency and duration of visits. Females preferred males with low aggressiveness and good spatial ability to males with high aggressiveness and poor spatial ability. Females showed no preference between males with high aggressiveness and good spatial ability and males with low aggressiveness and poor spatial ability. These results suggest that female choice and scramble competition will favour males with better spatial ability. In contrast, female choice does not seem to favour more aggressive males.

AB Social groups of false clown anemonefish have been described as queues because, following settlement, fish acquire social rank passively by outliving more dominant groupmates. Within each queue, reproduction is restricted to the dominant pair. Therefore, individuals should adopt tactics that maximize their likelihood of attaining social dominance. Field observations indicated that, independent of an anemone's size, postlarval false clowns are more likely to settle to an anemone if the resident group is smaller, suggesting that settlers prefer shorter queues. Some individuals (switchers) moved postsettlement. There was no indication that false clowns use switching as a tactic to enhance rank: characteristics of switching and nonswitching false clowns did not differ, and switching rarely resulted in improved social rank within the new group. Some high-ranked switchers acquired larger partners. Thus, while settlement preferences increased the likelihood of acquiring social dominance, switching may function, in part, to increase the benefit associated with social dominance once it has been acquired.

AB Unpalatable insects often advertise their defences to avian predators by conspicuous colours, such as red and yellow. Therefore, perhaps not surprisingly, birds tend to have unlearned biases against warningly coloured food. These biases are particularly evident when other components of insect warning displays, such as novel sounds and odours, are also present. We tested whether bitter taste, often associated with the defensive chemicals used by aposematic insects, can elicit or enhance specific colour aversions to red and yellow food in young domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus. In our first experiment, subjects were given familiar brown chick crumbs sprayed with either a 0, 1, or 4% quinine solution. In each palatability treatment, chicks were then offered a choice of palatable crumbs that were coloured either red and green or yellow and green. Chicks attacked (pecked or ate) fewer red and yellow crumbs and more green crumbs with increasing quinine concentrations. Chicks also ate fewer red and yellow crumbs with increasing unpalatability, although there was no effect on the numbers of green crumbs eaten. In a second experiment, we gave chicks a colourless drop of either 0 or 0.3% quinine solution and found that this also produced similar attack biases against red and yellow as is in the first experiment. Taken together, these results show that birds use unpalatable taste to adapt their visual foraging decisions, which has consequences for the evolution and stability of mimicry systems, and also has implications for the pairing of colour and taste in psychological experiments.

AB Individuals produce distinctive vocalizations that may contain considerable potential information about a signaller. Simply finding significant covariation between call structure and some individual attribute does not itself mean that there has been selection on callers to produce individually distinctive calls, nor on receivers to discriminate between them. Moreover, acoustic variation may degrade while being transmitted through the environment, making it potentially difficult for receivers to extract potential information. We focused on the individually distinctive calls of yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, to describe attributes of individuals encoded in calls. Using discriminant function analysis, we found significant potential information about identity, age and sex encoded in calls. When calls were broadcast and re-recorded over 10 m and 40 m, identity, age and sex remained statistically discriminatable. Key variables that enabled discrimination were repeatable (they had high intraclass correlation coefficients), whereas those that did not enable discrimination were less repeatable. Finally, statistics developed to describe, in a standardized and comparative way, the information about individual signallers contained in vocalizations, revealed that marmot alarm calls contained at least 3.37 bits of information about identity When compared to other species for which the information content of signals has been calculated, marmots may have not undergone strong selection for individually distinctive vocalizations. The fact that receivers discriminate between individuals suggests that receivers benefit by doing so.

AB The activity budget hypothesis proposes that the main force driving sexual segregation is the difference in activity between males and females. Recently, a model was developed to demonstrate explicitly that such differences in activity could, in theory, produce sexual segregation (Ruckstuhl & Kokko 2002, Animal Behaviour, 64, 909-914). The question remains whether realistic parameter values can also generate significant sexual segregation. Using this model and data on the body size dimorphism for 144 ungulate species, we compared the sexual segregation predicted by the model with expectations based on field observations. The results do not support the activity budget hypothesis as the main factor explaining sexual segregation. We investigated activity synchronization, the animal movement rule and transient spatial distributions in further detail. Introducing activity synchronization into the model slightly increases the ability of the activity budget to generate sexual segregation. Changing an animal's movement rule has a strong effect; movement rules that are independent of activity generate no Iona-term segregation. Finally, changes in a population's home range allow activity budget differences to generate transient sexual segregation. This method of generating sexual segregation is not sensitive to the animal movement rule and is potentially an important mechanism by which activity budgets can generate sexual segregation.

AB Female ornaments are expected to evolve through sexual selection when male parental investment is high. Blue-footed boobies are socially monogamous seabirds with a long period of biparental care. Males and females have colourful feet that are displayed ostentatiously during courtship, both before and after pairing, and extrapair copulations are frequent. We manipulated the foot colour of paired females to test whether this trait influences male courting behaviour, used here as an index of male preferences. There were no differences in time spent at the courting site, frequency of female courtship or frequency of copulations of 11 control and 15 experimental pairs. Experimental females, which had duller feet, received less intra- and extrapair courtship, suggesting that foot colour influences female attractiveness and opportunities for extrapair interactions. Our results support the idea that female foot colour in the blue-footed booby is favoured by sexual selection through male preference. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study, of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behavioural syndromes are correlations between behaviours in different contexts. For example, an individual's behaviour in response to a predator might be related to the same individual's behaviour towards conspecifics. We examined the developmental stability of single behaviours (activity in an unfamiliar environment, aggressive behaviour and boldness under predation risk) and correlations between these behaviours in two Californian populations of three-spined sticklebacks. Individually marked fish were measured for all three behaviours at three points during development, as juveniles, subadults and adults. Even though single behaviours were unstable through time, some correlations between behaviours were stable. For example, in one population, neither boldness nor aggression was stable but the positive correlation between them was. Certain correlations between behaviours were apparent at some developmental stages but not others, and the pattern of correlations differed between the two populations. These data suggest that behavioural syndromes do not necessarily limit behavioural plasticity, and suggest that ecological and developmental circumstances might favour different suites of traits.

AB Choices made by foraging animals should maximize energy intake, although 'irrational' short-term behaviours are common. One explanation for this is that environmental variation may lead to the evolution of behaviours that benefit individual reproductive output, but only over long timescales. Longterm (multiyear) fidelity to foraging regions in extremely variable environments may confer ecological benefits to individuals, such as familiarity with resources, even when energy gain is not consistently high in all years. We examined the annual foraging ranges (sometimes exceeding 3.5 million km(2)) of female southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, over 4 years and found that individuals used preferred regions year after year. We hypothesized that the degree of fidelity in a particular year was related to the foraging success (a measured by mass gain) in the previous year; however, there was no significant relation between the two. Despite this high variation in annual foraging success, the regions revisited in consecutive years provided higher potential food production as measured by higher variance in sea surface temperatures over two decades (a surrogate measure of ocean productivity). The evolution of long-term fidelity assisted by simple navigational rules may confer energetic advantages over an individual's lifetime and explain the existence of seemingly nonadaptive short-term behaviours.

AB Laboratory-based experimental studies of snake foraging have revealed complex and flexible reliance upon multiple cues for prey location and capture: thus, major features of foraging biology depend upon the detailed context of predator-prey encounters and prey antipredator tactics. Accordingly, we need field-based studies to evaluate and extend conclusions from laboratory studies, by (1) recording locations and behaviours of both predators and prey, and (2) experimentally manipulating prey stimuli to identify causal determinants of snake feeding responses. In the Australian wet-dry tropics, the homalopsine snake Enhydris polylepis forages at night in shallow water for sleeping fish. Such fish allow close approach, but flip upwards (and thus at least briefly, out of the water) when touched. Experiments showed that these snakes locate their prey primarily by visual cues, especially movement, rather than by scent or waterborne vibrations. Strikes are elicited by tactile cues, especially the splash of water as a fish leaps upwards. Demonstrating the value of field-based study, data on the location of prey (very shallow water) and their antipredator behaviour (flipping rather than swimming) thus enables us to identify the cue (splashing) most important for eliciting the snake's strike. A conventional laboratory study would not have yielded this insight. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Constraints theory says that when individuals reproduce with nonpreferred partners, they will have offspring of lower viability than when individuals reproduce with preferred partners. To test this, we performed mate preference trials free of experimenter biases about what traits in males make them attractive to females. We eliminated social interactions that could manipulate or obscure females' choices, including interactions between males, between females, and between the sexes. We then randomly placed each female with either her nonpreferred or preferred male in breeding trials to determine how components of fitness for breeders and offspring viability varied. Offspring viability (the percentage of eggs surviving to 45 days posthatch) and mother productivity (mean number of offspring at 45 days posthatch) were significantly lower when mothers reproduced with their nonpreferred partner than with their preferred partners. This study adds to the growing list of species in which reproduction with nonpreferred partners is known to be costly to breeder and offspring fitness. It is among the few studies of birds and the only study of a species with forced copulation showing fitness deficits for offspring and mothers from enforced reproduction with nonpreferred males. 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID REEF FISH; ECTOPARASITES; CRUSTACEA; BEHAVIOR; WRASSE; RATES
AB Cleaner fish, Labroides dimidiatus, prefer the mucus of the parrotfish, Chlorurus sordidus, to parasitic gnathiid isopods, the main items in their diet, indicating a major conflict between clients and cleaners over what the latter should eat during interactions. We tested whether the conflict varied with client species (and the quality of its mucus) and with the presence of blood in the gnathfids. First, we offered cleaners the choice between mucus of the parrotfish and that of the snapper, Lutjanus fulviflamma. When offered equal amounts of mucus on Plexiglas plates, cleaners readily developed a significant preference for the parrotfish mucus. Reducing the amount of parrotfish mucus by 75% made the preference disappear. In a second test, we offered the cleaners gnathiids that were or were not engorged with client fish blood. Cleaners showed no significant preference for either food item. Our results suggest that the degree of conflict between cleaners and clients may vary between species, depending on whether the latter have a preferred mucus. In contrast, the cleaners' lack of preference for engorged gnathiids benefits clients because it means that cleaners do not hesitate to eat unengorged gnathiids before the gnathiids harm the fish by removing blood or by transmitting blood parasites.

AB In a series of four experiments, chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, were given two cognitive tasks, an object choice task and a discrimination task (based on location), each in the context of either cooperation or competition. In both tasks chimpanzees performed more skilfully when competing than when cooperating, with some evidence that competition with conspecifics was especially facilitatory in the discrimination location task. This is the first study to demonstrate a facilitative cognitive effect for competition in a single experimental paradigm. We suggest that chimpanzee cognitive evolution is best understood in its socioecological context. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sex differences in provisioning rules have been found in a number of bird species, but the reasons remain unclear. Studies of begging in species with single-chick broods exclude the influence of nestling competition and may provide especially useful models for the study of signalling during parent-offspring conflict. We tested whether sex differences in provisioning rules occur in a species with an obligate brood size of one, the Manx shearwater. We found that chicks conveyed information about their body condition through begging, but male and female parents responded differently to that information. Females varied meal sizes according to the begging intensity of the chick and adjusted subsequent trip duration according to the chick's body condition after feeding, but males did not alter meal size or adjust trip duration. We discuss these findings in the context of recorded differences in the contributions to food provisioning by male and female parents, and we discuss why females may respond more sensitively than males to changes in chicks' nutritional requirements.

AB Female promiscuity is widespread in birds, as well as in other taxa. It is often assumed that in bird species with a socially monogamous mating system, females engage in extrapair copulations to obtain indirect (genetic) benefits. 'Good genes' and 'compatible genes' models predict that extrapair young (EPY) should be of higher quality than within-pair young (WPY), but the empirical evidence for this effect is limited. A recent study, however, indicated an enhanced cellular immunity in EPY in a passerine bird, the bluethroat, Luscinia svecica. To assess the generality of that finding, we replicated the study using the reed bunting, a passerine with an extrapair mating system similar to that of the bluethroat. Using the same immune assay protocol, we found no indication of enhanced cellular immunity in EPY compared with WPY. Female reed buntings thus do not seem to engage in extrapair copulations to achieve the same type of genetic benefit as in bluethroats. Furthermore, EPY in mixed-paternity broods did not grow faster and were not in better body condition close to fledging than WPY. We conclude that our results do not support the hypotheses assuming indirect benefits to female extrapair copulations. It appears that the adaptive value for females of pursuing extrapair fertilizations varies, even between species with similar extrapair mating systems.

AB Although it is often assumed that males and females have mating preferences for larger individuals of the other sex, potential underlying differences between male and female preferences for body size are not commonly investigated. Here, sexual differences in body size preferences are examined in the poeciliid fish, Brachyrhaphis rhabdophora. Females preferred larger males to smaller males, but preference did not appear to be affected by female size. One population-level analysis for males did not indicate an overall preference for larger females. A closer examination, however, revealed-an effect of male size on preference; larger males preferred larger females, while smaller males preferred smaller females. It appears then that females, regardless of size, share a preference for large males, but males differ in their behaviour, depending on their body size. In addition, while the degree of difference in size between paired females did not appear to affect male preference, the degree of difference in size between paired males strongly affected female preference; the greater the difference, the more strongly females preferred. the larger male. Thus, intersexual selection is found to operate in both sexes, but how it operates appears to differ. Intrasexual and intersexual. differences in mating behaviour may be missed when evaluating population-wide preferences. That is, there can be underlying differences in how the sexes respond and the consequences of such differences should be considered when investigating mate choice. The results are considered in terms of the evolution of mating preferences, alternative mating strategies, assortative mating, the maintenance of trait variation in a population, and current methods to evaluate mating preferences.

AB Two related species may mate readily yet rarely form hybrid zygotes. Such cryptic reproductive isolation may occur as a result of conspecific sperm precedence, suggesting that postmating sexual selection is a key process in speciation. However, demonstrating conspecific sperm precedence is nontrivial, and several methodological problems may confound the results of such studies. By mating females to conspecific and heterospecific males of varying degree of relatedness, we established the existence of conspecific sperm precedence in flour beetles,. Tribolium spp. Postmating incompatibilities seem to accumulate rapidly in this group of insects, and we discuss the implications of our findings for the influence of postmating sexual selection on speciation.

AB Nestmate recognition is the basic mechanism for rejecting foreign individuals and is essential for maintaining colony integrity in insect societies. However, in honeybees, Apis mellifera, both workers and males occasionally gain access to foreign colonies in spite of nest guards (=drifting). Instead of conducting direct behavioural observations, we inferred nestmate recognition for males and workers from the genotypes of naturally drifting individuals in honeybee colonies. We evaluated the degree of polyandry of the resident queens, because nestmate recognition theory predicts that the genotypic composition of insect colonies may affect the recognition precision of guards. Workers (N = 1346) and drones (N = 407) from 38 colonies were genotyped using four DNA microsatellite loci. Foreign bees were identified by maternity testing. The proportion of foreign individuals in a host colony was defined as immigration. Putative mother queens were identified if a queen's genotype corresponded with the genotype of a drifted individual. The proportion of a colony's individuals in the total number of drifted individuals was defined as emigration. Drones immigrated significantly more frequently than workers. The impact of polyandry was significantly different between drones and workers. Whereas drones immigrated more readily into less polyandrous colonies, worker immigration was not correlated with the degree of polyandry of the host colony. Furthermore, colonies with high levels of emigrated drones did not show high levels of emigration for workers, and colonies that adopted many workers did not adopt many foreign drones. Our data indicate that genetically derived odour cues are important for honeybee nestmate recognition in drones and show that different nestmate recognition mechanisms are used to identify drones and workers.

AB Penguins use vocal signatures as cues to identify their kin in dense colonies. Experimental studies of four species in two genera have pointed out that vocal signatures depend on the breeding ecology of the birds. Penguins that have a meeting site for pair members and chicks (genus Pygoscelis), as in many seabirds, have a less complex vocal signature than penguins that have no nests (genus Aptenodytes). To investigate whether this pattern would extend to other nest-building penguins, we studied the vocal signature in a species of the genus Eudyptes, the macaroni penguin, E. chrysolophus. Temporal and spectral features of signatures were analysed to determine which were likely to encode individual identity. Using a methodology derived from the theory of information, we measured and compared the amount of information given by each of these parameters by means of a stereotypy index. We then tested their effective efficiency in playback experiments of modified calls. Like Aptenodytes species, the macaroni penguins used a double coding system that integrated information in both the temporal and spectral domains. The encoding was made through the tempo given by the successive syllables of the call and the harmonic content of the call. However, information was not complementary but was mostly repeated in both domains, and variables were unidimensional as in Pygoscelis signatures. These results point out an original and simple signature system in macaroni penguins. Although they support the hypothesis of simpler systems in nest-building species they also reveal more subtle differences within this category.

AB In most cooperatively breeding birds the offspring of one sex, usually male, delays dispersal to remain on the natal territory and helps its parents to rear subsequent young. Thus delayed dispersal could be the first step in the evolution of cooperative breeding. We studied natal dispersal in a population of the group-living speckled warbler, Chthonicola sagittata, based on observations of a colour-banded population over 3 years. Unlike other group-living members of the Acanthizinae, all juvenile males in this population dispersed to settle on foreign territories as subordinates, which do not help rear the young. Speckled warblers showed all the life history traits that are thought to result in a saturated habitat and lead to delayed dispersal: they were sedentary, had high adult survival and had a male-biased sex ratio. However, they differed from other acanthizids in occurring at low density (0.18 birds/ha) on large breeding territories (6-12 ha), with a maximum of two males per territory. This may allow subordinates to live on foreign territories yet avoid aggression from dominants. A benefit of dispersal is that it provides an additional route to gaining a breeding vacancy. Dispersers can acquire vacancies on their new territory or on a neighbour's, but incest avoidance would be likely to constrain nondispersing males to neighbours' territories. A model of relative lifetime success showed that the survival benefits of natal philopatry are unlikely to outweigh this benefit of dispersal.

AB Many animals benefit from the presence of conspecifics by reducing their rate of scanning for predators while increasing their time spent foraging. This group size effect could arise from a decreased perception of individual risk (dilution hypothesis) and/or an increased ability to detect predators (detection hypothesis). We compared individual and group vigilance of Rocky Mountain elk, Cervus elaphus, in three regions of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, U.S.A. that varied in their encounter frequency with coyote, Canis latrans, grizzly bear, Ursus arctos, and grey wolf, Canis lupus, predators. Adult females without calves increased scanning and decreased foraging with high encounter risk and small herd size. Adult females with calves increased scanning and decreased foraging with high encounter risk, but showed no decrease in scanning with large herd size. Yearlings increased scanning and decreased feeding with small herd size, but not with high encounter risk. Adult males were least vigilant, fed most and were not influenced by encounter risk or herd size. These age-sex class differences led to significant differences in group vigilance depending on the composition of the herd. Herds with a majority of mothers were significantly more vigilant than herds with a majority of adult males. However, these differences in group vigilance had no influence on the individual scanning of females without calves. Thus, the decrease in individual scanning with herd size may depend more on changes in individual risk than on cooperative detection of predators.

AB Parents are expected to invest more in young that provide the greatest fitness returns. The cues that parents use to allocate resources between their offspring have received much recent attention. In birds, parents may use begging intensity, position in the nest or nestling size as cues to provision the most competitive young or those most likely to survive. It may also benefit parents to invest in young differentially by sex or relatedness if the fitness returns of sons and daughters differ or broods are sired by multiple males. We examined the allocation of food to tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor, nestlings in relation to their begging behaviour, size, sex and paternity. Provisioning by parents was not related to nestling size, sex or paternity. The begging behaviour of nestlings did not differ with respect to sex or paternity. Both parents were more likely to feed nestlings that begged first or were closer to the nest entrance, suggesting that parents allocate food resources in response to cues that nestlings control. As a consequence, brood reduction was facilitated by biased provisioning within the brood in addition to the nestling size hierarchies created by hatching asynchrony.

AB In seasonal environments animals organize their behaviour around annual cycles of resource availability. Wild black-capped chickadees are most likely to hoard food in autumn. At this time of year chickadees are also reported to have a larger hippocampus, a brain area important for spatial memory. This study examined how photoperiodic condition affects these seasonal changes. Captive chickadees were exposed to one of three treatments. Photorefractory birds were held on long days (19:5 h light:dark) and had small gonads. Photosensitive birds were held on short days (LD 9: 15 h) and also had small gonads. Photostimulated birds were switched from short to long days and quickly entered breeding condition with large gonads. Photosensitive birds (on short days) stored more seeds than photorefractory birds (on long days). Photostimulated birds stored seeds at a high rate when on short days, but reduced storing when transferred to long days. These results indicate that long days inhibit storing regardless of gonadal condition. There were no differences between groups in hippocampal volume, indicating that photoperiod can produce changes in food-storing behaviour without affecting hippocampal size.

AB In choosing a breeding partner, females in many animal species select between available males on the basis of several signalling traits. Some theoretical models of signalling evolution predict that multiple ornaments convey specific information on different aspects of male quality, such as current nutritional condition. We investigated the effect of nutrition on the calling song of male field crickets Gryllus campestris. This song is a multicomponent sexually selected signal. Adult males were kept on one of three feeding regimes, which resulted in significant differences in body condition between experimental groups. We found significant increases in calling rate and chirp rate and a significant decrease in interchirp duration with increasing food level. Other song characters, such as chirp duration, syllable number, chirp intensity and carrier frequency, were not affected by the food treatment. Furthermore, carrier frequency was correlated with harp area, which is an index of structural size in adult males. The calling song of the field cricket may thus serve as a multicomponent sexual signal, which contains discrete information on past growth and juvenile development as well as present nutritional condition.

AB The growth of bird song research over the past half century has been catalysed by both technical and theoretical advances. The study of mechanisms has largely moved to the neurobiological level, where work on bird song has blossomed. At the behavioural level, development and function have been the prime foci of attention, and I briefly review the advances in these two areas. But, looking forwards, the well is far from dry: I suggest a few topics on which I expect that papers will appear in the journal in the next few decades.

AB As areas of science mature, they pass through three, broadly overlapping stages of development, characterized respectively by description, explanation and synthesis. Field research on animal behaviour is making the transition from an area with a preponderance of purely descriptive studies to one that also includes the development and testing of verifiable hypotheses about the structure, causes and consequences of behaviour. We survey several reasons for this transformation of behaviour field studies and some of the major trends that characterize it, including: (1) patterns discerned in our cumulative knowledge of natural history; (2) increased support for behaviour field studies; (3) interfaces with related areas of science; (4) the development of observational sampling methods and other aspects of data sampling and analysis; (5) the development of models of behaviour's adaptive functions and life-history consequences; (6) long-term field sites that make possible complete life histories, increased attention to individual differences and intergenerational studies of behaviour; and (7) the development of techniques for remote tracking of animals and for noninvasive, hands-off sampling of a range of behavioural, physiological, genetic and environmental phenomena.

AB Various hypotheses propose that plumage ornamentation is a reliable indicator of the health or resistance to parasites and illness of individuals. The impact of endoparasites on plumage brightness has only recently been demonstrated experimentally. We tested the impact of ectosymbionts, in particular feather mites, on plumage brightness, using 2 years of observational data and experiments in the field. The abundance of feather mites during moult was negatively correlated with brightness and saturation of plumage coloration developed by male serins. The application of an insecticide before moult resulted in experimental males developing a brighter plumage than control individuals. Experimental adult males, but not juveniles, also developed more saturated plumages in one of the years, but did not differ from controls in the other year. This is the first experimental demonstration that ectosymbionts (including mites) have a negative impact on the characteristics of the plumage developed and consequently can signal the healthiness of their hosts.

AB Here we examine the ability of butterflies to learn colour cues in two different behavioural contexts, nectar foraging and oviposition, more or less simultaneously. We first trained female Battus philenor (Papilionidae) butterflies to associate a given colour with the presence of host plant leaf extract and assayed their colour preference; we then trained a subset of these butterflies to associate a second colour with the presence of sucrose solution and assayed colour preference once more. When offered an array of four unscented and unrewarding coloured models, 'single-trained' butterflies consistently alighted most frequently on their oviposition training colour. Green-trained butterflies landed on nontrained colours only about 4% of the time, while butterflies trained to red, yellow or blue made about 23% of their landings on nontrained colours; of those nontrained landings, most were on green. The majority of 'dual-trained' butterflies made the greatest number of visits to both training colours in the appropriate behavioural context; that is, they probed the models of their sucrose-associated colour and alighted on the models of their oviposition-associated colour. Landings or probes on nontrained colours in one context were consistently biased towards what was learned in the alternative context, suggesting an information-processing constraint in the butterflies. This paper provides a clear demonstration that butterflies can learn in two behavioural contexts within a short span of time. A capacity for such dual conditioning presumably permits female butterflies to forage effectively for egg-laying sites and nectar resources even when those activities are intermingled in time.

AB Conditioned taste aversions function by preventing an. organism from ingesting a food previously associated with gastrointestinal malaise. Taste-aversion learning has been observed in many animals: molluscs to mammals, insects to birds. However, among mammals, neither bats nor monophagous species have been investigated adequately. Here we show that although three dietary generalists (one insectivorous and two frugivorous bats) readily acquired taste aversions, the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, a monophageous feeder on vertebrate blood, did not learn to associate a novel flavour with aversive gastrointestinal events. We interpret these data as consistent with the hypothesis that taste aversions are an adaptive specialization of learning. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To the extent that relatedness between mates predicts their reproductive success, individuals are expected to bias their behaviours towards opposite-sex conspecifics according to differences in kinship. Here we show that monogamous male oldfield mice, Peromyscus polionotus rhoadsi, bias their social behaviour towards unfamiliar, distantly related females according to an average 1.3% difference in their kinship to these potential mates. Males in the present study favoured less-related females. Previous empirical investigations have not demonstrated behavioural biases based on such small kinship differences. Consequently, these small differences in kinship have been considered inadequate to drive the evolution of mate choice, particularly by males. Even a small incremental difference in mate quality, however, may significantly affect male reproductive success, especially for monogamous species or those that require maternal care. This study has demonstrated that the social preferences of male oldfield mice are distributed between females according to small differences in their kinship to these potential mates.

AB Mate retention is classically considered advantageous for reproduction in monogamous birds: because of their low fecundity, long-lived species should show the highest year-to-year mate fidelity. However, this hypothesis remains controversial: several studies have found no correlation between mate fidelity and longevity, possibly because they did not control for potential confounding factors on each of these parameters, and one study found a negative correlation in the Procellariiformes (albatrosses and petrels). We re-examined the relations between mate fidelity and longevity, and between mate fidelity and site fidelity, in this group, using our data on 13 species and data from the literature, and after eliminating confounding factors. Procellariiformes are the most long lived of birds despite important interspecific variation in body size, and they show strong mate fidelity and bear high costs of divorce. All species lay only one egg, and the most long lived breed biennially. Because large organisms live longer than small ones and their reproductive effort is lower, we had to control for breeding frequency and body size. Mate fidelity and adult life expectancy were positively correlated, regardless of whether we controlled for these two parameters. We also evaluated whether mate fidelity was related to site fidelity. Biennial albatrosses show high mate fidelity, but low nest fidelity, although they are extremely faithful to a small area around their previous nest. After controlling for body size, adult life expectancy and breeding frequency, we found no correlation between mate fidelity and site fidelity. Because divorce is costly and mate retention advantageous in Procellariiformes, we suggest that mate fidelity does not passively result from site fidelity in these species. Rather, site fidelity would be a means for pairs to reunite, with sites serving as meeting points. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Modern ageing theory is based on the observation that oxidative metabolism causes damage that results in a gradual loss of vitality, leading to senescence and death. If animals can oxidize only a given amount of substrate in a lifetime (i.e. the 'metabolic time' is allocated from a fixed budget), then behaviour may be aimed at maximizing benefits per unit of 'metabolic time' expended. We analyse the consequences of this view for two types of behaviour that are commonly expressed as rates with respect to clock time. Examples are given of locomotory behaviour in which the animals' preferred speeds are generally interpreted as a result of maximization of energetic efficiency. The same behaviour could be expected if animals were 'speed maximizers' with respect to metabolic time. Examples are given of foraging behaviour that is also best predicted on the basis of maximization of energetic efficiency. This makes sense only if energy is allocated from a fixed budget. However, foraging animals not only expend energy but also consume it so energy cannot be considered as being allocated from a fixed budget. The same behaviour could be expected if animals were 'energy intake rate maximizers' with respect to metabolic time. This makes sense if metabolic time is allocated from a fixed budget as suggested by ageing theory. The metabolic time concept can provide a crucial link between the optimum intensity of short-term behaviour and its long-term fitness consequences. We discuss the implications of this approach for the modelling of foraging behaviour. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB We tested sexually mature zebra finches to see whether social learning influenced their feeding preferences, in particular whether they followed the preference of a male or a female demonstrator, of a red-ringed or a green-ringed male, and of a familiar or an unfamiliar male. Each observer was exposed to two demonstrators feeding at different-coloured hoppers, and then tested with a choice of hoppers to see which of the two colours they preferred. Males showed no preference between male and female demonstrators when choosing from which colour of food hopper to feed, but females preferred to feed from the hopper colour the male demonstrator had used. Both males and females exposed to male demonstrators wearing red or green leg rings fed preferentially from the same colour hopper as the red-ringed demonstrators had used. Finally, male birds exposed to familiar and unfamiliar demonstrators, preferred the food hopper from which the familiar demonstrator had fed. We interpret the results as indicating differences between the demonstrators in the amount of attention they attracted from observers. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study ofAnimal Behaviour.

AB In cooperatively breeding birds multiple maternity and paternity of broods is not uncommon, reproduction often being shared among group members as well as with extragroup members. We investigated the extent of extrapair paternity and intraspecific brood parasitism in a population of cooperatively breeding long-tailed tits. Our aim was to determine the frequency and cause of mixed parentage and to investigate whether shared maternity or paternity was associated with decisions made by helpers. Genetic analyses using eight microsatellite loci showed that extrapair paternity was low (2.4-6.9% of nestlings, in 16-29% of broods), and that intraspecific brood parasitism was negligible. Mate switching and extrapair copulations were both observed, but mate switching was not responsible for the mixed paternity we recorded. Some extrapair offspring were assigned to males that became helpers, at the nest containing their extrapair young, but these males were also close neighbours of the. cuckolded males and so were the most likely males to gain extrapair paternity. There was no evidence that the existence of a direct reproductive stake in a brood played an important role in the helping decisions of either male or female helpers.

AB We compared the responses of two fleas, Xenopsylla dipodilli Parapulex chephrenis simultaneously exposed to the odours of their rodent hosts, Gerbillus dasyurus (specific host of X. dipodilli) and Acomys cahirinus (specific host of P. chephrenis). We hypothesized that, fleas are able to discriminate between host. species by using an odour cue and predicted that X. dipodilli and P. chephrenis would select an odour of an appropriate host Species. Xenopsylla dipodilli chose G. dasyurus significantly more often than A. cahirinus, whereas P. chephrenis chose A. cahirinus significantly more often than G. dasyurus. The ability, to select an appropriate host species did not differ significantly either between flea. species or between individuals of.,, different sex or age classes within flea species. No X. dipodilli, but 67 of 150 P. chephrenis, refused to choose a host. The latency to move in an experimental maze was. significantly shorter for X. dipodilli than P. chephrenis The flea species also differed in the time taken from the beginning of the movement to the choice of a host, with X. dipodilli being faster than P. chephrenis. Neither flea sex nor age affected this parameter in either species. Females of both flea species produced significantly more eggs when they fed on their specific host than when they fed on the other host species.

TI Infants as a commodity in a baboon market
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID FEMALE BABOONS; MONKEYS; RECIPROCITY
AB We used data from adult female chacma baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, to provide the first test of hypotheses on interchange trading and the structure of a biological market (No & Hammerstein 1994, Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 35, 1-11) within a primate group. The interchange commodities selected were grooming and handling of infants less than 3 months of age. Patterns of grooming in relation to infant handling showed strong evidence for interchange. Grooming for infant access was initiated by potential handlers and was significantly likely to be nonreciprocated. More critically, the data show that infant 'supply' created a market effect: grooming bout duration (the price 'paid' for handling) was inversely related to the number of infants present in the group. In addition, there was an inverse relationship between grooming bout duration and the rank distance between mothers and handlers, suggesting that higher-ranking mothers could demand a higher price for infant handling. Where rank distance was high, females were able to handle infants without grooming. Dominance could thus be used to disrupt the infant market effect. If biological markets models are to be fully applicable to primate groups (and those of other social mammals) then the potentially distorting effect of dominance needs to be incorporated into the framework.

DT Article

AB One striking characteristic in adult males of some odonate species is the presence of wing pigmentation. In Calopteryx species, males show a series of pre- and postcopulatory behavioural displays during which they face females while showing their pigmented wings. One hypothesis to explain the precopulatory flying displays and the associated wing pigmentation is that they may serve a sexual selection function. I investigated this in the territorial damselfly Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis. Males of this species defend aquatic substrates that females use for oviposition. Observational evidence indicated that males with a higher proportion of wing pigmentation were more likely to defend a territory, obtained more matings, had fewer gut parasites, survived in the study site and stayed in territories for longer. Experimental evidence suggested that the relationship mating success and wing pigmentation still held when controlling for the size of the substrate defended by territorial males. Similar to other studies in the Calopterygidae, these results suggest that wing pigmentation may be favoured by sexual selection. I discuss, however, whether an alternative function for male copulatory courtship displays and wing pigmentation, as sexual and/or species recognition, may also explain the evolution of these traits.

AB Size can have strong effects on reproductive success in both males and females, and in many species large individuals are preferred as mates. To estimate the potential benefits from mate choice for size in both sexes, I studied the effects of the size of each sex on the reproductive output of pairs of Banggai cardinalfish, Pterapogon kauderni, a sexually monomorphic obligate paternal mouthbrooder. When pairs were allowed to form freely, a size-assortative mating pattern was observed and larger pairs had a higher reproductive output as determined by total clutch weight and egg size. To separate the potential benefits from mate choice for size for each sex, I subsequently used these pairs to form reversed size-assortative pairs, that is, the largest male paired to the smallest female and vice versa. I found a positive correlation between male size and clutch size: relatively heavier clutches were found in pairs where females were given a larger male. This suggests that the size of the male influences clutch weight. For egg size, however, the size of both sexes seemed important. The study reveals the benefits of mutual mate choice on size in this species: larger females provide larger eggs and larger males can brood heavier clutches. Furthermore, these results suggest that females differentially allocate resources into the eggs according to the size of the mate. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Among the factors that may contribute to the evolution of social mono-amy are selection for extended mate guarding of females and selection for territorial 'cooperation'. Many socially monogamous taxa are also territorial, with 'partners' sharing a single territory, suggesting that one or both partners may benefit by sharing territorial maintenance. Snapping shrimp (genus Alpheus) are socially monogamous and territorial, living in excavated burrows or with host organisms, with females performing all parental care. The territorial cooperation hypothesis predicts that male and female partners share (1) territorial defence, resulting in a reduction in the risk of eviction from the burrow, (2) burrow construction duties, such that individuals in pairs spend less time in burrow construction relative to solitary individuals, and/or (3) foraging duties, by returning food to the burrow, where it is consumed by both partners. Using A. angulatus as a model species, a territorial defence experiment revealed that females in pairs were significantly less likely than solitary females to be evicted by female intruders, but males in pairs were not significantly less likely than solitary males to be evicted by male intruders. A subsequent experiment revealed that paired males were significantly less likely to be evicted by an intruding male if paired with sexually receptive females than if paired with nonreceptive females. Another experiment revealed that (1) paired females spent significantly more time in burrow construction than paired males, and (2) both males and females consistently returned food items to the burrow, perhaps incidentally provisioning their mates. These data suggest that social monogamy may have been selected for in part because of the advantages of territorial cooperation, as both males and females are likely to benefit by dividing the labour of territorial defence and maintenance. These tests of the territorial cooperation hypothesis are synthesized with data from tests of the extended mate-guarding hypothesis to place snapping shrimp pairing behaviour into a larger construct incorporating both the influence of ecological pressures (territoriality) and mating interactions between the sexes.

AB There is considerable interest in the role that ultraviolet (UV) cues play in the foraging and mate choice decisions of birds. However, with the exception of the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, it is not yet clear whether ultraviolet preferences are context specific, or whether birds show a general preference for full-avian-spectrum environments 320-700 nm) irrespective of the activity in which they are engaged. We investigated whether European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, and blue tits, Parus caeruleus, show general (nonresource based) or context-specific preferences for full-spectrum environments. We found that neither species showed a general preference for UV-present (UV+) over UV-deficient (UV-) environments, when those environments contained no resources (experiment 1). Furthermore, neither species showed a UV+ preference when cages contained food, water and perches (starlings; experiment 2) or food, perches and heterospecifics (blue tits; Hunt et al. 1999. Animal Behaviour, 58, 809-815). However, both species did show highly significant preferences for UV+ conditions when viewing potential mates. Such experiments are necessary before one can conclude that particular wavebands have specific relevance to mate choice. In fact, our results suggest that the importance of particular wavelength compositions do indeed vary with behavioural context. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We tested the hypotheses that the avoidance of faeces by herbivores leads to a grazing trade-off between nutrition and parasitism, and that the relative costs and benefits of the trade-off in relation to animal parasitic state determines their subsequent grazing behaviour. We divided 30 female sheep, Ovis aries, into three treatment groups, each of 10 animals. A parasitized and an immune treatment were created by daily dosing two groups of 10 sheep with the abomasal parasite Ostertagia circumcincta, for 3 weeks and 14 weeks before the experiment, respectively. The remaining sheep were maintained as nonparasitized (controls). Each of the three treatment groups was divided into two subgroups, each of which was placed in an experimental field plot and rotated around on a daily basis for 2 weeks. Each experimental plot was divided into a chequerboard of 100 patches with alternate patches contaminated with sheep faeces, Initially, all animals significantly selected to graze the noncontaminated patches resulting in disproportionate sward depletion. The significant avoidance of the faeces-contaminated patches by parasitized and nonparasitized sheep remained throughout the experiment. However, immune animals reduced their avoidance of faeces-contaminated patches during the latter stages of the experiment, resulting in a nonselective grazing strategy by the end. Compared with nonparasitized control sheep, immune sheep had increased rates of herbage intake and activity, and vice versa for parasitized sheep. We discuss the differences in grazing behaviour in relation to the sheep's state of parasite infection and the relative costs and benefits of the grazing trade-off. The behaviours used by herbivores to avoid the ingestion of parasites affects sward structure, creating a grazing trade-off between nutrition and parasitism, their response to which will determine their subsequent intake of nutrients and parasites, and thus fitness and survival.

AB In this study of songs of the singing honeyeater, Meliphaga virescens, we examined the consequences of isolation on the meme pool of syllables from which songs are constructed. We sampled four populations in Western Australia, two of which were sampled 7 years earlier. One mainland sample area, with a large number of syllable types, is part of a geographically extensive population whereas the other three samples with smaller syllable pools are from isolated island or island-like populations. The reduction in size of syllable repertoires of the more isolated populations may have resulted from founder effect. Comparisons over the 7-year period indicated that the population proportions of the syllable ty es did not change, significantly in either of the two resampled populations, although the correlation between sample years was stronger in the mainland population than in that of the island. In the two resampled populations, we found some new syllables, but some that were present 7 years earlier were missing. Two new syllables appear to have been derived from ones present in the earlier sample, perhaps representing cultural drift. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Migratory birds use the geomagnetic field and celestial cues to identify their migratory direction. In cue-conflict situations, when the two sets of cues give contradictory information, birds normally follow the direction indicated by the magnetic field and recalibrate celestial cues. To analyse the nature of these relearning processes, we repeatedly exposed Australian silvereyes, Zosterops 1. lateralis, outdoors to conflicting magnetic and celestial cues at sunset by deflecting magnetic north anticlockwise to 240 degrees west-southwest. The birds followed the altered magnetic cues, changing their preferred direction from south to east. During subsequent tests at sunset without magnetic information, the experimental birds continued to orient in the altered direction, confirming that they had recalibrated the celestial cues. Tested without magnetic information in the morning before sunrise, however, these birds preferred southerly directions that were not different from those of the control birds. This suggests that recalibration of celestial cues was specific for the time of the day when the birds had experienced the cue conflict. Relearning celestial compass mechanisms thus does not seem to be a generalizing process. The use of sunset cues is largely independent of the use of the corresponding cues at sunrise.

AB Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) and honeybees, Apis mellifera, both use odour cues deposited on flowers by previous visitors to improve their foraging efficiency. Short-lived repellent scents are used to avoid probing flowers that have recently been depleted of nectar and/or pollen, and longer-term attractant scents to indicate particularly rewarding flowers. Previous research has indicated that bumblebees avoid flowers recently visited by themselves, conspecifics and congeners, while honeybees avoid flowers visited by themselves or conspecifics only. We found that both bumblebees and honeybees also avoided flowers previously visited by each other when foraging on Melilotus officinalis, that is, bumblebees avoided flowers recently visited by honeybees and vice versa. Twenty-four hours after a visit, this effect had worn off. Honeybees visited flowers that had been visited 24 h previously more often than flowers that had never been visited. The same was not true for bumblebees, suggesting that foraging honeybees were also using long-term attractant scent marks, whilst bumblebees were not. Flowers previously visited by conspecifics were repellent to bumblebees and honeybees for ca. 40 min. During this time, nectar replenished in flowers. Honeybees were previously thought to use a volatile chemical (2-heptanone) as a repellent forage-marking scent. We suggest that they may be using a less volatile chemical odour to detect whether flowers have recently been visited, possibly in addition to 2-heptanone.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB Intraspecific social systems vary considerably as a function of environmental parameters (Lott 1984, Behaviour, 88, 266-325). For example, nonmonogamous species may engage in facultative partner preferences and parenting to offset the costs associated with harsher breeding conditions. Because no field or laboratory research has examined nonmonogamous meadow voles under suboptimal conditions (e.g. low-density summer populations or during colder months), it was not known whether meadow voles could form affiliative preferences for a specific partner. The aim of this experiment was to identify whether meadow voles develop selective partner preferences and if so, under what circumstances. We assessed partner preferences using a choice apparatus in which the test animal chose to spend time with a familiar mate or stranger. We paired and tested males and females (within photoperiod) under one of five different conditions: after 24 h, 10 days, or 23 days of cohabitation with mating or after 24 h or 10 days of cohabitation without mating. Male and female meadow voles rapidly formed selective partner preferences for a familiar mate when compared with controls in nearly every condition, regardless of photoperiod, cohabitation duration, or whether mating did or did not occur. Within 24 h, males directed significantly more aggression towards unfamiliar animals, and mating enhanced this effect. For females, 24 h of social cohabitation was sufficient to decrease aggression towards partners, but stranger-directed aggression appeared later, following delivery of the litter. These data suggest that meadow voles are capable of developing selective partner preferences and stranger-directed aggression and may have evolved these abilities to maximize reproductive success during the colder months of the year or under low population density during the summer breeding season.

AB Pairing patterns in monogamous birds are thought to be the consequence of mutual mate choice by males and females for characters linked to individual quality in the opposite sex. Although this may result in assortative pairing for a single character, there may be no simple match between male and female phenotype if the traits linked to individual quality are sex specific. For instance, in several passerine species, females tend to select males on the basis of territory quality or characters that may reflect health or vigour, whereas males benefit from pairing with females in good condition that breed early because early breeding increases reproductive success. We investigated pairing patterns in an urban population of the sexually dimorphic European blackbird in relation to bill colour in males and body condition in females, over a 3-year period. Females breeding early were in significantly better condition than those breeding late. The number of breeding attempts per season was significantly positively correlated with female condition, while the number of fledglings reared by a female in a breeding season was positively correlated with the number of breeding attempts, independently of female condition. Bill colour varied in males and was related to body weight, although not to condition. Female condition was correlated with male bill colour within pairs, with males showing more orange bills being paired to females in better condition. We discuss the observed pairing pattern in relation to individual or territory quality and to the constraints and costs associated with reproduction in each sex.

AB In crickets, females show preferences for male traits such as body size and either reject outright, take longer to mate with, or remove the spermatophores of nonfavoured males sooner, interrupting sperm transfer. In most mate choice studies, however, empirical tests so far have concentrated on choice between simultaneously presented males, which may not reflect the natural situation. We exposed sequentially to potential mates females that ranged from completely naive (virgin) to twice mated. Naive females did not remove the spermatophores of smaller males sooner, but tended (nonsignificant) to reject small males outright. With increasing experience, there was a general decline in spermatophore retention time, but large males were favoured: females either increased retention time when large males succeeded small males or maintained it for the same duration. There were more rejections when small males succeeded large or small males, but fewer when large males succeeded small males. Females appeared to 'bet hedge' at the first copulation, rather than be unable to judge male size/quality; but with increasing experience, their spermatophore retention and rejection behaviour clearly indicated a favouring of large males and an active discrimination against small males. There was a first-male advantage in terms of sperm transfer, but subsequent female behaviour compromised any advantage gained by a small first mate.

AB In social insects, workers stay in their natal nests and help to rear their siblings, rather than founding independent nests. In three field experiments, we investigated the factors influencing the decision of workers of the paper wasp Polistes chinensis antennalis to stay in their natal nest. We divided nests of P. chinensis antennalis in half and placed each half separately in the field. Workers were then allowed to choose one of the halves, one of which had a queen and the other did not. Workers initially visited both halves, but later visited only one. When both half-nests contained brood, they were maintained by a group of wasps as two independent colonies, even though one had no queen. In addition, the initial presence of workers in the nests did not affect which nests were maintained. When one half-nest contained brood and the other did not, only the half with brood was maintained. This result is consistent with the 'life insurance advantage' hypothesis for the evolution of eusociality. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Over the last three decades, many studies have attempted to explain forager diets by using optimal diet theory (ODT). Despite some obvious successes, the utility of this theory remains controversial. We reviewed the results of 134 studies of optimal diet theory to test hypotheses on factors that can explain variation in the ability of ODT to predict diets and diet shifts in response to changes in prey availability. Our major conclusion is that while ODT has generally worked well for foragers that feed on immobile prey, the theory often failed to predict the diets of foragers that attack mobile prey. We found only mixed support for the hypothesis that the theory works better when the study scenario more closely fits the assumptions of the model. Contrary to our a priori predictions, forager types (invertebrate versus ectothermic vertebrate versus endothermic vertebrate) did not differ in their likelihood of corroborating ODT. Two explanations for why optimal diet theory does not work well with mobile prey are that studies on mobile prey often lack information on key parameters that are required to rigorously test ODT, and that with mobile prey, variations among prey in vulnerability (encounter rate and capture success) are often more important than variation in predator active choice in determining predator diets.

AB I investigated the relationship between male human vocal characteristics and female judgements about the speaker. Thirty-four males were recorded uttering five vowels and measures were taken, from power spectrums, of the first five harmonic frequencies, overall peak frequency and formant frequencies (emphasized, resonance, frequencies within the vowel). Male body measures were also taken (age, weight, height, and hip and shoulder width) and the men were asked whether they had chest hair. The recordings were then played to female judges, who were asked to rate the males' attractiveness, age, weight and height, and to estimate the muscularity of the speaker and whether he had a hairy chest. Men with voices in which there were closely spaced, low-frequency harmonics were judged as being more attractive, older and heavier, more likely to have a hairy chest and of a more muscular body type. There was no relationship between any vocal and body characteristic. The judges' estimates were incorrect except for weight. They showed extremely strong agreement on all judgements. The results imply that there could be sexual selection through female choice for male vocal characteristics, deeper voices being preferred. However, the function of the preference is unclear given that the estimates were generally incorrect. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To elucidate some of the functions of chemical communication in giant pandas, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, we systematically exposed captive males, oestrous and nonoestrous females to each others' odours by providing access to one another's temporarily unoccupied enclosures. In comparison with control observations, pandas from all reproductive categories displayed a dramatic increase in several measures of chemosensory responsiveness, both when visiting another panda's enclosure and when encountering scent deposited in their home enclosure. Evidence for discrimination between odours encountered as a resident versus a visitor was minimal, but male pandas' response patterns were suggestive of a territorial function. We also found evidence for discrimination of sex and reproductive condition via chemical cues. Males showed a marked preference for female odours, investigating, licking, scent marking and vocalizing more in response to female than male odours. Males also vocalized more in response to oestrous than nonoestrous female odours. Nonoestrous females licked more and oestrous females vocalized more when encountering male than female odours. Our data on vocalizations suggest a potential role for odours in the activation of sexual motivation. We argue that the low reproductive success observed in captivity may be attributed in part to failure to provide sufficient opportunities for chemical communication, and encourage the judicious management of social odours to promote natural mating (e.g, using intersexual odour exposure to increase libido and decrease aggressiveness prior to mating introductions).

AB The developmental processes producing preferences for opposite-sex mating partners are not well understood. Zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, are colonial and socially monogamous with biparental care. To determine whether the early social environment contributes to sexual partner preference, we removed adult males from breeding colonies when the oldest chicks were less than 1 week old (male-removal rearing) or left them in the breeding cage (control rearing). At independence, male-removal and control offspring were moved to unisex cages. As adults they were given two-choice tests with male versus female stimuli followed by group aviary tests. Male-removal subjects, unlike controls, did not prefer opposite-sex stimuli in the two-choice tests. Male-removal subjects were less likely than controls to successfully pair with opposite-sex birds in the group aviary tests; 38% of them paired with a same-sex bird. Thus early social experience may contribute to a critical component of mate choice, choosing the opposite sex, in this pair-bonding species.

AB In previous studies we have shown that those male Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus, that as fetuses resided in intrauterine positions (IUPs) located between two female fetuses (2F males) have lower circulating levels of testosterone, less well-developed genital musculature, and lower reproductive success than males gestated in IUPs between two male fetuses (2M males). We have also found that such 2F males spend more time caring for conspecific young than do 2M males, and that presence of a 2F male, but not of a 2M male, with a lactating female and her litter decreases the cost to a dam of suckling one litter while gestating a second litter conceived in postpartum oestrus. Here we show that some 2F males, those with circulating levels of testosterone similar to those seen in females of their species, show no interest in females in oestrus and fail to impregnate females with which they are paired. Such 'asexual' 2F males spend 30-50% more time caring for nestlings than do sexually active 2F males. We suggest that such asexual, highly parental 2F males are incapable of direct reproduction and are obligate helpers at the nest that can contribute to their own fitness only by assisting to rear collateral kin.

AB Data from several field studies support the hypothesis that female European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, attend to variation among the songs of conspecific males when making mate-choice decisions. However, for a variety of methodological reasons, direct evidence for female preferences based on song in starlings has been lacking. This study presents a novel technique for assaying directly female preference and choice in European starlings by using the presentation of conspecific male song as an operant reinforcer in a controlled environment. Using an apparatus in which the playback of songs from different nestboxes is under the operant control of the subject, we demonstrate how the reinforcing properties of conspecific song can be used to measure female preference and choice. The results of the study suggest three conclusions. First, female starlings prefer naturally ordered conspecific male songs over reversed songs. Second, female starlings display robust preferences for longer compared with shorter male song bouts. Behaviour in the operant apparatus varied directly with male song bout length. Third, preferences based on song bout length are sex specific. Male starlings failed to respond differentially to the same stimuli for which females showed strong preferences. These results suggest that male-male variation in song bout length is important fnr mate choice among starling. In addition we detail the use of a novel behavioral assay for measuring female preferences that can be applied to similar behaviours in other species of songbirds.

AB Biparental investment in birds is implemented through parents making adaptive compensatory adjustments according to the work rate of their collaborator. Predictions for such evolutionarily stable cooperation in parental nestling feeding, and the behavioural mechanisms involved, can also be applied to systems with helpers-at-the-nest. Using the cooperatively breeding Arabian babbler, Turdoides squamiceps, we experimentally increased the provisioning rate of one or two subordinate birds in each group by giving these individuals extra food. Compared with control days before and after, the experimental treatment caused 'fed' birds to increase and 'unfed' birds to decrease their nest visit rates significantly, with no significant changes in load size. Thus, both parents and helpers in this system showed individual compensatory adjustments in their nestling-feeding effort according to the work rates of collaborators. There were no significant increases in total group visits during experimental treatments; therefore this study did not provide evidence for the predicted incomplete compensatory response. These results for helping-at-the-nest are consistent with empirical studies on parental care, and further suggest a central. role for nestling begging in any cooperative provisioning of young in the nest.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID MATE CHOICE; POECILIA-RETICULATA; COLOR-PATTERN; STICKLEBACKS; RISK
AB In many species male sexual characteristics are known to be affected negatively by parasites, which render their hosts unattractive to females, but how parasites affect the mating decisions of their female hosts has received little attention. The monogenean parasite Gyrodactylus turnbulli reduces the sexual display and colour intensity of male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, which makes them less attractive to females. Here, I examine how these parasites affect the mate choice behaviour of their female hosts. Virgin females were experimentally exposed to G. turnbulli and allowed to choose between an attractive and an unattractive male in a simultaneous choice test. Infected females were significantly less discriminatory than healthy ones and their level of activity during choice trials was reduced with increasing parasite load, suggesting an energetic constraint imposed by the parasites. This result implies that sexual selection pressure for male showiness is diminished, which is consistent with recent theoretical models. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB I combined a comparative study of begging in ground- and tree-nesting wood warblers (Parulidae) with experimental measures of the predation costs of warbler begging calls. Throughout their development, ground-nesting warbler nestlings had significantly higher-frequency begging calls than did free-nesting warblers. There was also a trend for ground-nesting birds to have less rapidly modulated calls. There were no consistent associations between nesting site and the amplitude of the calls. Using miniature walkie-talkies hidden inside artificial nests, I reciprocally transplanted the begging; calls of 5- and 8-day-old black-throated blue warblers, Dendroica caerulescens (tree-nesting) and ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapillus (ground-nesting) and measured the;corresponding changes in rates of nest predation. For the begging calls of 8-day-old nestlings, but not those of 5-day-olds, the calls of the tree-nesting species coming from ground nests incurred greater costs than did the calls of ground nesters. The reciprocal transplant had little effect on the rate of predation. Tooth imprints on clay eggs placed in artificial nests indicated that eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, were responsible for the increased cost of begging for black-throated blue calls coming from the ground. These data suggest that nest predation may be responsible for maintaining some of the interspecific differences in the acoustic structure of begging calls.

AB We conducted laboratory experiments to investigate interpopulation differences in the behavioural responses of the whelk Buccinum undatum to the predatory lobster Homarus americanus and the asteroid Leptasterias Polaris, both in the absence and presence of feeding opportunities. Whelks from three populations in the eastern North Atlantic (1) responded to lobsters by displaying avoidance behaviours (burrowing in the sediments or retreating inside their shell), (2) responded to asteroids by displaying escape responses (rapid crawling, shell rocking behaviour or foot contortions), and (3) more often refrained from feeding in the presence of a lobster than in the presence of an asteroid. Although whelks from the three populations responded similarly to lobsters and asteroids, interpopulation differences were evident. Thus, whelks from populations sympatric with a given predator more frequently displayed 'appropriate' antipredator behaviours (i.e. avoidance in the presence of a lobster, and escape in the presence of an asteroid) than did whelks allopatric with that predator. Also, whelks from a population sympatric with both predators fed less readily in the presence of a given predator than did whelks allopatric with that predator. However, the presence of a lobster or an asteroid had the same impact on the feeding response of whelks from two populations with contrasting predator fields, one sympatric with lobsters, but allopatric with asteroids, and one sympatric with asteroids, but allopatric with lobsters. The results of our study indicate that coexistence (over evolutionary or ecological time) with lobsters and asteroids increases the propensity of the whelk to display avoidance and escape behaviours in the presence of lobsters and asteroids, respectively, but has a less predictable effect on how whelks trade off predation risk and food acquisition. Studies are needed to investigate the roles of nheritance and experience on the development of antipredator behaviours and decision making by prey animals when predation risk conflicts with other fitness-related activities such as the acquisition of food or reproductive opportunities.

AB We studied female Choice and reproductive success ina marked population of sedge warblers, Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, from 1995 to 1996. Three genera of parasitic blood protozoans, namely Haemoproteus sp., Trypanosoma sp. and Plasmodium sp., were identified from blood samples taken from all breeding adults. Relatively high prevalence values of 19.5% in 1995 and 37.5% in 1996 were associated with increased levels of white blood cells relative to the number of red blood cells. Compared with nonparasitized males, parasitized males had significantly lower repertoire sizes in both years of the study, in one year, they also spent less time in song flights and weighed less. They also provisioned their broods at a lower rate. Parasitized females produced the same clutch size as nonparasitized females, although their broods were smaller at 7 days old. We suggest that haematozoan infections may reduce the expression of sexually selected song traits. Furthermore, such infections may influence the standard of parental care provided by males; although further research is needed to determine whether this is mediated through genetic resistance to parasitism or the effects of parasitism upon immediate body condition.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID FEMALES COPY; IMITATION
AB In four experiments, we examined the effects on the affiliative preferences of 'focal' female Japanese quail given the opportunity to watch a conspecific male interact with a 'model' female. Experiments were conducted in three, 10-min phases: (1) a pretest, during which a 'focal' female chose between two males; (2) an observation phase, when each focal female watched the male she had spent less time near during the pretest (her 'nonpreferred' male) interact with a 'model' quail; and (3) a post-test, during which each focal female again chose between her nonpreferred and preferred males. Focal females increased their preferences for nonpreferred males after seeing them together with a model female (but not a model male), even if the nonpreferred male and model female were separated by an opaque barrier that prevented them from interacting. A focal female's preference for the end of the enclosure containing her nonpreferred male was not increased when she either watched him court a concealed model female or watched a model female that was being courted by him. Taken together, the present results suggest that a simple tendency for females to approach areas where they have previously seen a male and female quail, in preference to locations where they have seen only a male quail, can explain some of the effect of watching a nonpreferred male mate on a female's tendency to affiliate with him. However, focal females also showed enhanced preferences for nonpreferred males they had seen mating after we both moved those males and controlled for effects of transposition. Thus, processes akin to both 'mate choice copying' and 'conspecific cueing' remain viable explanations for the increase in a focal female quail's tendency to affiliate with a male she watched mate with another female.

AB Acoustic signals must be transmitted from a signaller to a receiver during which time they become modified. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis suggests that selection should shape the structure of long-distance signals to maximize transmission through different habitats. A specific prediction of the acoustic adaptation hypothesis is that long-distance signals of animals in their native habitat are expected to change less during transmission than non-native signals within that habitat. This prediction was tested using the alarm calls of four species of marmots that live in acoustically different habitats and produce species-specific, long-distance alarm vocalizations: yellow-bellied marmot, Marmota flaviventris; Olympic marmot, M. olympus; hoary marmot, M. caligata; and woodchuck, M. monax. By doing so, we evaluated the relative importance the acoustic environment plays on selecting for divergent marmot alarm calls. Representative alarm calls of the four species were broadcast and rerecorded in each species' habitat at four distances from a source. Rerecorded, and therefore degraded alarm calls, were compared to undegraded calls using spectrogram correlation. If each species' alarm call was transmitted with less overall degradation in its own environment, a significant interaction between species' habitat and species' call type would be expected. Transmission fidelity at each of four distances was treated as a multivariate response and differences among habitat and call type were tested in a two-way MANOVA. Although significant overall differences in the transmission properties of the habitats were found, and significant overall differences in the transmission properties of the call types were found, there was no significant interaction between habitat and call type. Thus, the evidence did not support the acoustic adaptation hypothesis for these marmot species. Factors other than maximizing long-distance transmission through the environment may be important in the evolution of species-specific marmot alarm calls.

AB We tested the hypothesis that day-old chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, can learn to avoid an aversive stimulus if they observe the responses of another chick. In experiment 1, one of a pair of chicks (the actor) was allowed to peck at a bead coated in the bitter-tasting substance methylanthranilate (MeA), while we prevented the other chick (the observer) from pecking the bitter-tasting bead by separating the chicks with a piece of wire mesh. Both chicks avoided pecking at a similar but dry bead 0.5, 3 and 24 h after the observer chick saw the actor chick peck at an MeA-coated bead. By contrast, when the actor chick had pecked at a water-coated bead, both chicks continued to peck at a dry bead at 0.5, 3 and 24 h after training. Experiment 2 investigated whether observer chicks showed avoidance if they were prevented (by the insertion of an opaque barrier) from observing their companion pecking at the MeA-coated bead during either training or testing. Observer chicks that could not see their companion during training but could observe the actor chicks at test showed no subsequent avoidance whereas chicks that observed the actor chick at training, but not during testing, showed high levels of avoidance. Although the sensory cues (visual, auditory or olfactory) or types of behaviour (i.e. levels of pecking or head shaking) that the observer chick used to maintain avoidance remain unclear, the results show that chicks can learn about an aversive object by observing the responses of a conspecific.

AB In response to disturbances in their surroundings, Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, utter a distinctive call, the 'shrill bark'. Differences within this call type correlate with the stimulus eliciting the calling. I tested whether monkeys categorized calls according to the eliciting stimulus and whether their perception of calls coincided with the classification derived from the acoustic analysis. Different playback designs using the habituation-dishabituation paradigm were created:in which calls exhibiting varying degrees of acoustic difference were paired. I conduct experiments in two populations of semi-free ranging Barbary macaques. The results suggest that subjects categorized calls according to the eliciting stimulus. In addition, subjects from the population in which the recordings were made were significantly better than subjects from the other population at discriminating between calls with small acoustic differences. The results suggest that call categorization is influenced by experience, mediated by individual knowledge of the caller or common call characteristics within the population.

AB The influence of relatedness on the pre-and post-emergent survival of honey bee queens was investigated. Workers did not preferentially rear sisters over non-siblings under conditions of natural queen replacement. After queen emergence, however, there was a significant effect of a queen's relatedness to the workers on her survivorship during fights with rival queens. The mechanism of this bias towards related queens is unknown, and several hypotheses are discussed. The difference in post-emergent survivability suggests that kin selection may operate during competition among adult queens at this crucial stage of honey bee reproduction.

AB We examined whether the early onset of incubation serves to protect eggs from the dangers imposed by conspecifics in the green-rumped parrotlet, Forpus passerinus, a small neotropical parrot that lays a large clutch and begins incubation on the first egg. Nestboxes with eggs were installed and their fate was followed for 72 h to determine whether egg destruction and nest site take-overs occurred as predicted by the Egg Protection and Limited Breeding Opportunities Hypotheses, or whether additional eggs appeared in the boxes as predicted by the Brood Parasitism Hypothesis. Eggs were destroyed at 40.6% of 69 experimental boxes but at only 4.5% of control nests occupied by laying pairs. No eggs were laid in the experimental boxes. Egg destruction at experimental nests occurred during daylight hours and all mortality was caused by green-rumped parrotlets. Over 75% of the nests were destroyed by male-female pairs prospecting for nest sites, and the remainder were destroyed by male-male pairs. Lone males never destroyed eggs, although they frequently visited experimental boxes. Two of three failures at control nests were the result of nocturnal predators, and the other nest was apparently destroyed by parrotlets. There was no significant difference between experimental and control boxes in the frequency of visitations by lone males, male-female pairs and male-male pairs. Although experimental boxes that parrotlets visited were discovered quickly after placement, parrotlets were usually slow to enter them ((X) over bar = 5.8 h after discovery, range 0.3-23.5 h). Control nests were rarely left unattended: females spent nearly 75% of their time in the box, and pairs were typically absent for short intervals (median=7.5 min). Control females responded to intruding parrotlets by remaining in the box 94% of the time when alone, whereas males actively displaced and chased intruding parrotlets 66% of the time. Parrotlets that visited control nests approached the box significantly less often than those visiting experimental boxes. To ensure the survival of eggs, parrotlet parents must begin incubating eggs or guarding nests soon after laying to minimize destruction of clutches, loss of nest sites, a decline in the viability of their eggs and the time that all nestlings are exposed to predators.

TI Food supply for settling male rock pipits affects territory size
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID INTRUSION PRESSURE; DENSITY; DEFENSE
AB Theory predicts that abundant food may favour larger breeding territories, provided that males could gain some important benefit, such as improved mating success or breeding performance, from keeping a large territory. The time saved when food is easy to find may be used to defend more space, unless increased defence costs offset the savings in foraging time. A previous experiment with concealed food addition close to laying did not reveal any effects on rock pipit, Anthus petrosus, territories. In this study the food intake rate of males was manipulated at the time of arrival from the winter quarters, by providing a concealed food source at the centre of each territory. The aim was to reduce foraging time, without attracting intruders, in order to isolate any effects of food abundance. Fed males had larger territories and tended to defend longer stretches of shoreline than control males. The difference in territory size was not related to male age or order of arrival. These results suggest that males settling at concentrated food sources may be able to establish large territories, and that keeping a large territory confers some advantage. We discuss possible reasons why food intake rate later during the breeding season did not affect territory size. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   PREDATION; BEHAVIOR; GROWTH; YOUNG; LOAD
AB Fledging in the common swift involves young having to switch suddenly and completely from the sedentary lifestyle of a nestling to continuous flight with no post-hedging care. Using manipulations of brood size and the contrasting resource conditions in different breeding seasons, I observed fledging under a range of chick states. Poorly fed chicks took longer to hedge, and had lower body mass and short wing length at fledging. Despite this, maximum body mass of nestlings always exceeded those of adults and fledged young. Under all conditions, nestlings lost mass for 1 week prior to hedging, and at fledging they had similar wing loadings. I suggest that in their last days in the nest young swifts use up the fat stores that insured them against irregular parental provisioning as well as losing water from the drying out of feathers. Reductions in body mass associated with increases in wing length before fledging will affect flight efficiency by increasing the lift:drag ratio. This is interpreted as 'slimming' down to the optimal body mass which would improve the lift:drag ratio and set fledgings up for their life on the wing.

ID AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; STURNUS-VULGARIS; RISK; CHOICE; BEHAVIOR; REWARDS;
   TIME
AB Risk-sensitive foraging theory is based on the premise that unpredictable runs of good or bad luck can cause a variable food source to differ in fitness value from a fixed food source yielding the same average rate of gain but no unpredictability. Thus, risk-sensitive predictions are dependent on the food intake from variable sources being not only variable but also unpredictable or 'risky' in outcome. This study tested whether unpredictability is a component of the value that foraging starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, attribute to food sources that are variable in the delay to obtain food. Two groups of birds chose between a fixed and a variable delay option; the variable option was unpredictable in the risky group and predictable in the risk-free group in the overall rate of intake it yielded. In both groups the fixed option was adjusted by titration to quantify the magnitude of preference for predictable and unpredictable variance. On negative energy budgets both groups were significantly risk-prone, with the risky group being significantly more risk-prone than the risk-free group. Switching the birds to positive budgets by doubling the size of each food reward had no significant effect on preference, and similar trends to those found with negative budgets were observed. These results are not readily explained by risk-sensitive foraging theory, but may be explained by the algorithm used by the birds to attribute value to average expected rewards.

   DECEPTION
AB By making female birds pair successively with different males, and analysing the paternity of the eggs laid? it is possible to examine how a male's success in obtaining fertilizations is determined by the timing of his copulatory access to the female. Such an experiment is reported here with pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca. Mate switching was induced at different stages within the female's fertile period by removing the resident male. The paternity of the clutch was analysed by microsatellite DNA typing. Removed males had full paternity in the clutch if they were removed as late as after the second egg was laid (day 1), and they lost all paternity if they were removed more than 1 day before the first egg was fertilized (less than day - 2). Male switching during the period day - 2 to day 1 always resulted in mixed paternity in the clutch. Males that were paired to the female for only a few (1-3) days during this period achieved on average more than one fertilization per access day, with a peak on day -1. Thus, assuming that the timing of observed pair bonds reflects the timing of each male's copulatory access to the female, the first eggs in the laying sequence were fertilized by inseminations occurring shortly before the time of fertilization, whereas the last eggs were fertilized by inseminations taking place several days prior to their fertilization. Our documentation of the most important period for copulatory access has some important implications for understanding sexual behaviour in this species.

AB Female mating preferences and the male colour pattern characteristics upon which preferences are based vary both within and between guppy, Poecilia reticulata, populations from Trinidad. A general trend is for the degree of preference for orange coloration to match the degree of expression of orange coloration in each population, resulting in a positive correlation between the means of the two traits across populations. This study documented an exception to this trend. The mating preferences of female guppies from Trinidad's Yarra and Paria Rivers were compared using standard behavioural assays. Because Yarra males show less orange coloration in their colour patterns than do Paria males, results of previous studies led to a prediction in the present study of a corresponding difference in mating preferences between Yarra and Paria females. Both Yarra and Paria females, however, showed a strong preference for more orange individuals when responding to courtship by Paria males. The expression of preference in Yarra females therefore does not match the expression of orange coloration as predicted. Several hypotheses are suggested that may account for this apparent mismatch.

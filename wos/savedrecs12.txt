AB The effects of the lack of maternal care on offspring survival of the sub-social beetle Copris incertus Say (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) were tested experimentally by excluding the female and determining the most vulnerable stage of development. Time budget studies were also conducted to determine the amount used by 10 females during the whole cycle from the making of the nest to the emergence of adults. A Kruskal-Wallis test and the subsequent non-parametric multiple comparisons showed a significant difference in survival between nests cared for by the mother and nests where the mother was excluded. Key-factor analysis showed that the absence of parental care affected offspring survival in the transition from the pupal to adult stage. Time budget studies indicated that, whether active or inactive, females were in direct association with the brood balls. Balls that received no care (in experimental exclusions or where the female abandoned the nest) were invaded by the fungi Metarrhizium anisoplae and Cephalosporium sp., which covered the surface and the inner part of the ball, considerably affecting pupal survivorship. Results show that sub-social care increases the probability of juveniles reaching adulthood. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Assessments during shell exchanges by the hermit crab Clibanarius
   vittatus: The complete negotiator
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behaviour of the hermit crab Clibanarius vittatus was studied as it investigated shells prior to and during shell exchange interactions. Crabs behaved in a manner predicted by the negotiations model of resource exchange, that is, shells were primarily exchanged between crabs when both crabs benefited in shell fit from the exchange. During initial investigation of shells, crabs in poorly fitting shells selected shells that (1) were similar to the preferred shell size of the investigating crab and (2) that did not fit their current occupant well. In addition, the greater the shell deficit (deviation from that crab's preferred shell size) of the other crab, the more likely it was investigated by a crab in a poorly fitting shell. Considering three factors (initiator's preferred shell size, current shell deficit of the non-initiator and magnitude of gain possible for the non-initiator) explained 86% (multiple r=0.93) of the variance in shells rapped by initiating crabs. In those interactions that proceeded to rapping behaviour, the magnitude of gain in shell fit that the non-initiating crab would experience if a shell exchange occurred helped explain which shells were selected for rapping. The relative size of the two crabs was only important in the assessment and decisions process once rapping began, and the number of raps was inversely proportional to the relative size difference of the crabs.

AB Alpine accentors and dunnocks bred in polygynandrous groups in which two or more unrelated males shared two or more females. In both species, a female solicited actively to both alpha and subordinate males whereas an alpha male attempted to guard the female to monopolize paternity. Females combated the restrictions imposed by alpha mate guarding by increasing their solicitation rate to males who had gained less mating access. Males increased their copulation rate in response, but alpha males ignored more of the offers. In both species, even when a female mated with both alpha and beta males she often gained just one male's help with chick feeding. Under these conditions, alpha male alpine accentors reduced their amount of help with a decreased mating share, whereas beta males did not. In dunnocks, however, neither alpha nor beta males reduced their help provided a critical share of the matings was exceeded. As predicted if females attempted to maximize male help, female alpine accentors preferred to give more matings to the alpha male while female dunnocks preferred alpha and beta equally. There was no evidence for either species that alpha males sired fitter offspring; within broods of mixed paternity, there was no difference in the weights of chicks sired by alpha versus subordinate males. Female dunnocks competed with other females by territory defence whereas female alpine accentors had overlapping ranges and competed directly for male attention, increasing their solicitation rate to the alpha male if other females in the group were fertile. We suggest that the extraordinarily high rates of solicitation by females, refusal by males and copulation rates (up to a thousand per clutch) in the two species are the outcome of sexual conflict over the control of mating.

AB In the lekking cichlid fish, Oreochromis mossambicus, males dig and defend spawning pits where courtship and mating occur. Under natural conditions, females may encounter solitary or aggregated males and experience varying degrees of male interference during courtship and spawning. Female mating preferences are difficult to tease apart from the effects of male-male competition in these circumstances. Mate choice by females was studied in the laboratory under conditions that prevented male-male competition and courtship interference. Female O. mossambicus received choices between (1) a large and a small male or (2) a large and a small spawning pit. Females showed no preference based on male size, but 17 of 19 females chose the larger spawning pit. To determine the relationship between male size and spawning pit size, the volumes of spawning pits dug by small and large males in wading pools were measured. Spawning pit sizes of small and large males were similar regardless of whether small and large males were segregated or inter-mixed. Therefore, male size was not a good predictor of spawning pit size. To determine whether interactions between males influence female mate choice, females were presented with an interacting pair of males. Seventeen of 19 females mated with the larger of the two males. Videotape analysis revealed that large and small males were similar in behaviour during two of the three time blocks analysed. Although male behaviour may have influenced female decisions, male size was the most salient feature. The results confirm that females assess both site and male characteristics, and suggest that female choice and male-male competition together are important components of sexual selection in this lekking animal.

TI HONEY-BEES ARE PREDISPOSED TO WIN-SHIFT BUT CAN LEARN TO WIN-STAY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID LANDMARK
AB The ability of honey bees, Apis mellifera, to avoid returns to locations recently depleted of sugar solution (win-shift) or to return to locations recently depleted of sugar solution (win-stay) was tested. Bees collected sugar solution from a small matrix of six cells. During each of a series of trials, they first visited a randomly determined set of three cells. They were then allowed to freely choose between the six cells, with the contingencies encouraging either win-shift or win-stay behaviour. Previous research indicates that honey bees use spatial working memory to discriminate previously visited cells from unvisited cells in this experimental preparation (Brown & Demas 1994, J. comp. Psychol., 108, 344-352). In the present experiment, bees in the win-shift condition tended to choose previously unvisited cells throughout the experiment. Bees in the win-stay condition learned to choose previously visited cells over the course of the experiment. These results indicate that bees choose locations based on previous visits, either being attracted to, or repelled from, locations recently depleted of forage.

AB The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, adjusts its exploratory behaviour according to group size. Colonies of three different sizes were allowed to explore novel, empty arenas of three different sizes. Ants were tracked on videotape using a computerized image analysis system. At high densities, the shape of searchers' paths becomes more convoluted; at low densities, paths are more linear. Previous theoretical work shows that this relation between individual path shape and group size maximizes the discovery rate of the group as a whole. Temporal patterns were examined in density of ants in the novel arena, path shape, and the rate at which area covered by the group expanded. The density of ants in the novel arena increased over the course of 40 min of exploration, but there were no significant temporal patterns of path shape. The area covered by exploring ants increased more rapidly early in the exploration (after 5 min in the novel arena) than later on (after 20 min). The results show that individual ants adjust the shape of their paths in a way that maximizes the discovery rate of the group as a whole. This provides an intriguing new example of how individuals, each acting independently, can generate group-level behaviour. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The gargle vocalization of the black-capped chickadee, Parus atricapillus, was recorded at the same site over a 19-year period. This vocalization consists of an array of different note types that are combined to generate various call types. Each male has a large repertoire used in agonistic encounters, and many variants are shared with other members of the population. The vocalization was analysed at several different levels: note types and various lengths of note-type sequences including the whole call. Remarkable stability was shown for all levels, and the main changes observed were minor ones of relative frequency of occurrence. Reasons for stability may include persistence of note types in linkage groups that could be transmitted as units (memes) and other rules governing ordering of note types in the can (syntax). Also, natural selection may impose some constraints on the process of cultural transmission. We compare our findings with those of the few available long-term studies of bird song. Chickadee gargles are transmitted very precisely compared to other vocalizations that have been previously studied. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Laboratory paradigms currently available for study of behavioural traditions in animal populations do not provide sufficient information to permit extrapolation from laboratory findings to more natural situations. By focusing solely on the transmission process, such paradigms fail to provide an opportunity to explore fully the complex determinants of the longevity of behavioural traditions and the probability of diffusion of socially transmitted behaviour patterns through populations. The reliability of a new model system is established that will permit exploration of the effects of (1) individual learning about the environment and (2) social relationships between bearers of tradition and recruits to a population, on maintenance and propagation of traditions of food preference in colonies of Norway rats. 'Founder' colonies of four rats were taught an arbitrary food preference. Individual members of the founder colonies were then slowly replaced with naive subjects. Three generations of replacements after the last founder had been removed from a colony, the arbitrary food preference taught to a colony's founders was still evident. The behavioural mechanism supporting the observed traditional behaviour in rats was identified, as was a possibly important, previously unidentified parameter (the duration of opportunities to learn by sampling alternatives) influencing the stability of behavioural traditions in animals.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB The well-known attraction of corvid birds to bright, shiny, inanimate objects appears to be without direct or immediate utility. Whether this attraction is an exploratory behaviour related to food finding was tested. All objects that four ravens contacted in a semi-controlled but relatively natural forest environment during 38 (usually daily) 30-min sessions were recorded, starting when they left the nest. During the first 10 sessions (up to 15 days post-fledging), the young birds contacted 980 natural objects of 95 kinds or categories that were not added into their environment. In the 28 subsequent sessions, 44 novel item categories were introduced sequentially into their environment and the birds' attraction to these items was compared to previously seen (background) items and to several criteria (edible/inedible, conspicuous/cryptic). The juvenile birds always preferentially chose items that they had never seen before, from 42 to 24 000 times above previously contacted items. Attraction depended on the novelty of the item, without relevance to either its palatability or its shininess or conspicuousness. Novel inedible items, however, were soon treated as background items regardless of their conspicuousness or previous attractiveness. Edible items, in contrast, became preferred items. The birds' behaviour should result in their assessing the background milieu of any environment and then potentially finding all edible objects in it. This prediction was tested by subjecting the forest birds to a range of items from a seashore. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

   CONSEQUENCES FOR PREDATOR HUNTING SUCCESS AND PREY PREDATION RISK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SHOAL SIZE; POECILIA-RETICULATA; BEHAVIOR; FISH; MINNOWS; GUPPY
AB Models of group living assume that the hunting success of predators and per capita predation risk of prey decrease with increasing prey group size. In contrast to numerous studies documenting anti-predator advantages of group living, little is known about the choice of predators for particular prey groups. Two shoals of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, which differed in size (2 versus 5 fish, 5 versus 10, 2 versus 10, 10 versus 16), were simultaneously presented to individual blue acara cichlid fish, Aequidens pulcher, and the shoal that was attacked first, the number of subsequent attacks and the total time cichlids spent near each shoal during a 3-min period were recorded. For all three criteria, the cichlids showed a significant preference for the larger of the two shoals, resulting in a higher per capita risk in terms of first attack and attack duration for individuals in larger shoals. Further trials, in which guppy activity was manipulated by using different water temperatures, showed that the cichlids preferred a smaller over a larger shoal if the larger shoal was kept in cold water (i.e. exhibited less movement). This result demonstrated that the visual conspicuousness of the shoal, and not its size per se, was the key factor for the cichlids' choice of a prey shoal. In a final experiment, wherein cichlids were given an opportunity to attack free-swimming shoals (comprised 1-8 individuals), predator hunting success decreased with increasing shoal size. We conclude that, despite the over-proportionately high attack risk for individuals in large shoals, per capita predation risk is lower than in small shoals, and joining larger shoals should be advantageous for individual guppies. Cichlids, however, would do better in terms of hunting success by attacking small rather than large shoals. Potential implications of such predator preference for larger shoals are discussed.

TI FACTORS AFFECTING THE RATES OF FOOD CALLS GIVEN BY RED-BELLIED TAMARINS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID COTTON-TOP TAMARINS; VOCAL COMMUNICATION; SAGUINUS-OEDIPUS; DOMESTIC
   CHICKEN; CHIMPANZEES; RECEIVER
AB Food calls have been identified in a number of avian and mammalian species. Most investigations of the proximate elicitors of food calls have focused on palatability, quantity or divisibility of the food. Proposed, but mostly untested, functions of food calling have typically centred around the benefits associated with sharing food or attracting conspecifics to the food site. In two experiments involving five groups of captive red-bellied tamarins, Saguinus labiatus, rates of food calling were quantified in conjunction with four variables: quantity of food, food preference, food exchange, and visual contact with groupmates upon discovery of the food source. In agreement with other studies of food calling, calling rates increased when the food was particularly palatable, and when it was presented in large quantities. Food exchanges were not associated with food calling. There was also a social-location effect: when the food was discovered while the finder was temporarily out of visual contact with its groupmates, rates were higher than when groupmates were visible, even when the quantity of food was very small, and hence not 'sharable'. These results suggest that red-bellied tamarin food calls are not entirely governed by opportunities or inclinations to share food, nor are they solely a function of arousal in the presence of large amounts of preferred food. Red-bellied tamarin food calls may be functionally analogous to those of house sparrows, Passer domesticus, which recruit flockmates to the vicinity of the caller. To the extent that a species is dependent on intra-group cohesion for critical daily activities and protection, food calls may benefit the caller by drawing its allies near, even if calling increases feeding competition.

AB Unlike most passerines, female superb fairy-wrens are prolific solo singers. Four hypotheses for the function of female song were evaluated: (1) to defend territories; (2) to maintain contact with mates; (3) to assess the amount of time mates are spending on the territory; and (4) to solicit displays from extra-group males. Female song rates increased as fairy-wrens reasserted territorial boundaries after a period of communal winter flocking. Song rates were not affected by the age of the female, the time she had been paired to her current mate, the time her mate had been the dominant male on the territory, or the composition of her group. However, females that had recently established territories, or had undergone significant changes in territorial borders, sang at higher rates than females that had been established in their territories for many years. Playback experiments revealed that: (1) females were more likely to sing in response to songs of male or female neighbours than to songs of their mates or their own song; (2) females responded more intensely to songs of female strangers than to songs of female neighbours; (3) extra-group males did not respond with extra-group courtship displays when a female's song was played back from her territory, although some territorial responses were elicited. The stronger response to neighbours indicates that mate location and mate assessment are not major functions of female song. The display solicitation hypothesis can be rejected because extra-group males did not respond to playbacks of females, and there was no correlation between female song rate and the incidence of male display. In contrast, the results suggest that the major function of female song is territorial defence, and that receivers use variation in the song to discriminate between different classes of individuals (self, mate, neighbour, stranger).

ID COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY
AB One way in which new ideas spread is through travel of individuals to and away from centres of innovation. Here, a process is described wherein at least 84 North Americans travelled to work in European ethological laboratories prior to 1975 and at least 15 European ethologists relocated in North America. The North Americans typically learned of ethology from courses, readings, advisors and personal meetings. They were attracted to the kind of science promulgated by ethologists and generally reported positive experiences in Europe. These interactions were one factor as Europeans were successful in spreading their discipline and North Americans found an approach that was congenial and allowed them to build successful academic and scientific careers.

AB Our understanding of communication by female mammals about reproductive state is currently limited by a paucity of information about signalling during pregnancy and lactation. To address this situation, odour communication was examined in meadow voles by means of preference tests. In experiment 1, males showed no preference for odours of a reference female versus a pregnant female or odours of a reference female versus a lactating female throughout most of pregnancy and lactation. However, preferential attraction to one of these scents occurred around parturition. Just before parturition (day 19-20 of gestation) males showed a preference for the odour of a reference female over that of a pregnant female. Immediately after parturition, during postpartum oestrus (day 1-2 of lactation), however, male preferences reversed so that males preferred scent of a postpartum oestrous female over that of a reference female. In experiment 2, the odour preferences of females were examined across pregnancy and lactation. Females maintained a preference for odours of a male over a reference female during pregnancy, postpartum oestrus and lactation. These results differ from those reported for other species in which females show a repeated oestrous cycle. These results also suggest the existence of some complexities of odour communication during the transition from pregnancy, postpartum oestrus and lactation in a species in which females show an induced oestrus.

AB To elucidate the role of female choice in the evolutionary maintenance of some morphological features of male ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, a series of experiments were performed with captive animals. Mate-choice trials were made with both live males and stuffed models. Stimuli males were manipulated in the length of the tail, the size, colour and presence of black points in the wattle, the length of the ear tufts, and the general brightness of the plumage. Tail length, length of the ear tufts and the presence of black points in the wattle positively influenced the females' choice but neither wattle size or colour nor the brightness of the plumage did.

AB The effect of developmental temperature (18 degrees C versus 25 degrees C) on the body size and territorial success of male fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, in paired contests was examined. When tested at ambient temperatures of either 18 degrees C or at 27 degrees C, adult males raised at 25 degrees C were relatively small in size but nevertheless had greater territorial success (control of a food/oviposition resource) than males raised at 18 degrees C. This result negates a 'size-advantage hypothesis', which predicts that males raised at 18 degrees C should be more successful at either contest temperature by virtue of their larger size. It also negates an 'acclimation-advantage hypothesis', which predicts that males raised at 18 degrees C should be more successful than males raised at 25 degrees C in contests at 18 degrees C, but less successful at 27 degrees C. The data are consistent, however, with an 'optimal developmental temperature hypothesis', which suggests that flies raised at 25 degrees C, even though phenotypically small, are physiologically vigorous and will perform relatively well under diverse environmental circumstances. Thus, bigger isn't always better. In a small-scale experiment (territoriality scored only at 27 degrees C) in which all males had the same developmental temperature (25 degrees C) males whose parents developed at 25 degrees C were more successful than were males whose parents developed at 18 degrees C. These experiments demonstrate that developmental temperatures, both within and between generations, influence territorial success in male flies.

ID MATE CHOICE; TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA; PAIR FORMATION; STICKLEBACKS; BEHAVIOR
AB In zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, females prefer males that display at a high rate. In these experiments the effect of a female's experience on this preference was tested. Females were presented with a pair of males before and after being exposed to one of three treatments: (1) males with a low display rate, (2) males with a high display rate, or (3) no new males. Female preference for the male of the initial pair that displayed more was affected by the above treatments. Females increased their relative preference for this male if they had been exposed to males with a low display rate, decreased their preference if exposed to males with a high display rate, and did not change their preference if exposed to no new males. To test whether the changes in preference were sexual, the experiment was repeated with female pairs before and after the intervening treatments. There was no effect of the treatments on female preference for female pairs. The implications of these results for models of sexual selection and mate-choice strategies are discussed.

AB DNA fingerprinting showed that 15% of 62 house martin nestlings at study colonies in central Scotland were not related to their putative fathers, and 32% of 19 broods contained at least one extra-pair chick. There was no evidence of intraspecific brood parasitism. Birds were never seen to mate outside nests in the vicinity of nesting colonies, and the single copulation that was observed during this study was a pair mating that took place inside a nestbox. Extra-pair birds were often seen to enter nests, with seven of eight identified intruders being males from other nests where laying had already taken place. Pair males mate guarded by ensuring that females spent very little time alone at the nest from about 7 days before the first egg of the clutch was laid, and by accompanying females on up to 70% of flights away from the nest during the 4-5 days before laying commenced. Mate guarding seemed to slacken after egg laying began, with a gradual transition to incubation behaviour taking place. Associated with this was a higher likelihood that the youngest nestling would be fathered by an extra-pair male. Male removal experiments indicated that extra-pair birds were more likely to enter the nest of a fertile female when the pair male was absent, but in three cases where DNA fingerprints were obtained male removal during the fertile period of the pair female had no apparent influence on paternity.

AB Although many sources of sexually specific chemical signals have been identified, few attempts have been made to identify all the sources of sex-specific information in any species or to determine whether the various cues that provide this information have the same communicative functions. Sources of sex-specific odour information were identified using a preference task in meadow voles. An examination was made of the amount of time that long-photoperiod male and female voles investigated different scents from opposite- and same-sex conspecifics. The data indicate that there was a highly localized pattern of sexual information on the bodies of meadow voles. Three scents were preferentially investigated by opposite-sex subjects: both male and female voles investigated scents from urine, faeces and the anogenital area of the opposite sex more than those of the same sex. Two additional scents resulted in sexual preferences, but not in a symmetrical fashion. Males investigated scents from the mouth of females over the mouth scent of males, but females showed no preference. Both males and females investigated scent from the posterolateral region of males more than those of females. Mouth and posterolateral area may provide different information and/or have different functions compared to the sex-specific scents from urine, faeces and the anogenital area.

AB The response of captive willow tits to a life-like, stuffed sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, was studied during four consecutive winters in Central Norway. Birds from 31 flocks, usually consisting of one adult mated pair, with two first-year males and two first-year females (non-kin), were studied in an outdoor aviary. When the sparrowhawk, kept 4 m away out of sight of the tits, was suddenly presented to individual birds, all the tits froze and some gave alarm calls. Adult birds gave alarm calls more frequently than juveniles, adult males more than juvenile males, and adult females more than juvenile females. Adult males gave an alarm call more frequently when they could see their mates than when they could not and alarm calling may therefore be a form of investment in the mate.

AB Although mixed paternity in broods of young is now known to occur in many species of birds, the question remains, does mixed paternity reflect only a male strategy, or might it not also be a reproductive strategy of females? To address this question female red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, in egg-laying condition were given the opportunity to mate repeatedly with either or both of two males, in the absence of male-male competition. Over the course of five mating trials nearly all females chose to mate with both available males, regardless of the appearance of the males' plumage. Similarly, although females are known to prefer males with larger combs, when the two males possessed combs of strikingly different sizes, most females mated with both individuals. These results suggest that in this species a female reproductive strategy is to obtain sperm from more than one male during production of a clutch of eggs.

AB In resource-limited systems where territories are defended year-round or during the breeding season, individuals sometimes shift to new territories. Here, data on territory establishment and site fidelity in a population of Eurasian red squirrels, in a coniferous woodland, are used to test three hypotheses explaining territory shifts: (1) a female actively bequeaths her territory to some of her offspring; (2) an old female leaves her territory to her offspring when her future reproductive potential is lower than that of her offspring; (3) a female that initially settled on a poor quality territory shifts to a vacant, higher quality territory. Of 44 adult females, only seven moved from the territories on which they first settled to adjacent, vacant territories. Females that shifted did not actively bequeath their territories to their offspring. However, females on territories with poor food resources were most likely to shift and they shifted only when the new territories contained more food than the old ones. After shifting, females improved their reproductive rate. These results suggest that territory shifts are adaptive and occur as a response to poor breeding conditions.

ID LATERALIZATION; ASYMMETRIES; RECOGNITION; PREFERENCES; RETINA; BRAIN
AB Domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, are known to show bias to left hemisphere control on day 8 and to right on days 10 and 11. These shifts were here shown to affect viewing, so that the eye feeding the controlling hemisphere was used to view either a simple object to which the chick was socially attached or a hen seen for the first time (i.e. right eye, day 8; left, day 11). Right hemisphere bias was maximal on day 11. Timing of shifts did not differ between the sexes, and so cannot explain sex differences in tests of lateralization. In females, different stimuli tended to evoke different patterns of eye use, which were superimposed on the age-dependent shifts: the hen tended to be viewed with the right eye, and a small simple novel stimulus (a small light) with the left. Both of these patterns are consistent with other evidence for the specializations of left and right hemisphere. Other viewing patterns involved both hemispheres: the most unexpected was the use, by the hemisphere that because of age was the controlling one, of the subordinate hemisphere to monitor the stimulus.

AB The behaviour of wild-caught Mus spretus towards tunnels previously occupied by conspecifics, and to the conspecifics themselves, was examined to test whether (1) willingness to investigate and enter tunnels corresponded to the predictions of territorial avoidance, and (2) exposure to substrate odours primed a defensive response to the odour's donor. Adult males and females were provided with a choice of a clean tunnel versus one that had been occupied by themselves, by a conspecific from the same, a neighbouring or a distant area, or by a woodmouse, Apodemus sylvaticus. Mesh caps initially prevented tunnel entry while investigation was measured, then they were removed to record choice of entry. Subsequently, mice met the odour's donor in a neutral arena. Almost all aggression was between mice from different capture areas and affiliative behaviour was between those from the same area. Conspecific odours attracted more investigation than clean tunnels, although odour investigation varied according to the subject and donor's sex and their relative capture areas. Mice investigated then avoided entering a neighbour's tunnels, consistent with predictions of territorial avoidance. Provided with conspecific odours from the same or a distant area versus a clean tunnel, mice generally entered whichever tunnel they had preferred investigating before the tunnels were opened. Regardless of capture area, mice that entered a scented tunnel were significantly more defensive on encountering the donor than those that entered clean tunnels, especially towards female donors. This suggests that mice entering an apparently occupied (scented) area were primed to display submissive behaviour towards a potentially dangerous resident.

AB Individual differences in early exploratory behaviour were investigated in hand-reared juvenile male great tits, Parus major, during the first 18 weeks of their life. The juveniles differed consistently in their reaction to a novel object in a familiar environment, either when tested with different objects or when tested again after 9 weeks. Birds that approached a novel object more quickly were also quicker to visit all artificial trees present in a novel environment than birds that approached a novel object more slowly. These behavioural differences extended to the strength of foraging habits, built up during a training period in which food was always offered at the same place. After a change in the location of food, the quicker birds would keep going to the place where the food used to be. The slower birds tended tb change their behaviour and stop going to the former place. The results show that juvenile male great tits differ consistently in various aspects of their exploratory behaviour at least during the first 18 weeks of life. The variation in behaviour was not likely to arise from differences in general activity or physical condition, but seems to refer to differences in the way in which information concerning the environment is collected and dealt with.

AB The response of a bird predator (Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonicus) to the potential cues present in the multiple-component defence of an aposematic insect (seven-spot ladybird, Coccinella septempunctata) was investigated. Ladybirds were presented to captive quail either whole, or in treatments in which the ladybird's colour pattern, smell or taste were added to a palatable beetle, either singly or in paired combinations. Colour pattern was the most effective single deterrent, but the interaction between colour and taste was also important. The birds could detect the insect's smell, but rarely used it as a cue to toxicity. No element, either alone or in paired combination, was sufficient to maintain avoidance at a level comparable to the whole insect. The results are discussed with respect to aposematic function and avian foraging behaviour.

AB Factors associated with the evolution of sexual dimorphism in sockeye salmon were examined by relating individual behavioural correlates of reproductive success with morphological measurements in both sexes. Adult salmon were captured, measured and tagged, then released and observed in Iliamna Lake, Alaska. Males were generally larger than females (447 versus 428 mm) and had larger dorsal humps and more elongated jaws for their length. Indices of male reproductive success varied considerably among individuals (e.g. 0-12 observations in dominant status). Male social status was positively associated with both length and dorsal hump size, independent of length. Ah resident females completed spawning and only nine of 82 had their nests dug up by other females. However, size-related variation in spawning-site location was observed; larger females tended to spawn in shallower water than did smaller females. Thus reproductive success apparently varied much more in males than in females. Consistent with the theory regarding the evolution of sexual dimorphism, the greater variability in male reproduction was directly associated with the greater average size and exaggerated shape of males.

AB Considerable evidence across many taxa demonstrates that prior social experience affects the outcome of subsequent aggressive interactions. Although the 'loser effect', in which an individual losing one encounter is likely to lose the next, is relatively well understood, studies of the 'winner effect', in which winning one (sic) increases the probability of winning the next, have produced mixed results. Earlier studies (sic) concerning whether a winner effect exists, and if it does, how long it lasts. The variation in results, however, may arise from different inter-contest intervals and procedures for selecting contestants employed across previous studies. These methodological differences are addressed through a series of experiments using randomly selected winners and three different inter-contest intervals in the pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus. The results indicate that a winner effect does in fact exist in pumpkinseed sunfish, but that it only lasts between 15 and 60 min. Based on these results, predictions about the behavioural dynamics of hierarchy formation are discussed, and it is suggested that it may be impossible, in principle, to predict the outcome of dominance interactions between some individuals before they are actually assembled to form a group. Finally, the possible mechanisms underlying the winner effect are explored.

TI SCATTER-HOARDING BY A LARDER-HOARDING RODENT - INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION
   IN THE HOARDING BEHAVIOR OF THE EASTERN CHIPMUNK, TAMIAS-STRIATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID FOOD; SQUIRRELS; SYSTEM
AB The adaptive significance of alternative patterns of dispersing hoarded food was examined by determining which factors influence the occurrence of scatter-hoarding in the eastern chipmunk a species that typically larder-hoards food to its burrow. A standardized food-provisioning test was used to determine the incidence of scatter-hoarding in relation to age, sex, reproductive condition, time of year, patch position and social context. Juveniles and females with young scatter-hoarded significantly more often than did other classes. Newly emerged juveniles scatter-hoarded both before and after they acquired a permanent burrow of their own, but decreased their frequency of scatter-hoarding as they grew older and more capable of defending their burrow. Females with young in the burrow did not appear to use scatter-hoarding to avoid revealing the location of the burrow, but may have been avoiding the risk that their young would consume all their hoarded food. The incidence of scatter-hoarding was not affected by the distance of the patch from the burrow nor by the number of competing sciurids at the patch. However, scatter-hoarding was more often performed by individuals that were harassed at the patch. This may have been a response to leaving the patch with an incomplete load; experimental exclusion of animals before they had completed loading demonstrated that possessing a small load increased the tendency to scatter-hoard. For juveniles and non-breeding adults, scatter-hoarding permitted more rapid removal of food from a patch than did larder-hoarding, but for females with young, scatter-hoarding trips took longer than larder-hoarding would have, largely because such females often made more than one hoard per trip. These results do not support the hypotheses that scatter-hoarding is a vestigial behaviour pattern of no adaptive significance or that is is simply a response to lack of larder space. They do, however, support the hypotheses that scatter-hoarding reduces pilferage of hoarded food by individuals unable to defend a larder and that it increases the rate at which subordinate individuals can sequester food from ephemeral patches.

AB Young Drosophila larvae (24-28 and 48-52 h old) show a preference for feeding in dark environments, while older larvae (72-76h post-hatching) prefer more illuminated environments. Changes in the photoresponse during larval development are characteristic of D. melanogaster, D. immigrans, D. hydei and D. virilis. In contrast, larvae of D. simulans, D. gaucha, D. pavani and D. funebris show no change in their response to light during larval development, both dispersing and feeding in dark environments. A biometrical analysis of the development of larval photoresponse of D. melanogaster shows that the genetic structure involved in the expression of this behaviour depends on larval age. At 24-28 h of age, additive, dominant and epistatic components were found. At 48-52 h, dominant and epistatic interactions were significant. At 72-76 and 96-100 h of age only non-allelic interactions were important. Thus, epistasis tends to increase as larval development progresses. The concepts of genetic co-adaptation, developmental homeostasis and heritability are discussed in relation to the development of larval photoresponse in D. melanogaster.

AB Long-term effects of the pre-weaning environment on prairie vole pups were investigated. Two hypotheses were proposed to explain potential consequences to individuals reared with or without older siblings: (1) siblings affect an individual's subsequent reproduction by affecting size at independence or (2) older siblings increase the tendency of younger siblings to engage in affiliative behaviour with their own offspring. Experiment 1 tested whether size at separation from parents affects reproduction. All voles were reared only with parents to eliminate effects of differential pre-separation social experience. Weight at separation from parents was highly correlated with peripubertal weight, suggesting compensatory growth is not complete. Larger females produced pups that grew faster than pups from smaller females. Experiment 2 examined size at separation and pre-weaning social experience. No effect of male weight at separation from parents was found. On average, females that were large at separation from parents produced litters at shorter intervals and had pups that gained more weight prior to day 20 than did pups reared by small females. Contrary to the expectations, males reared with older siblings brooded pups less frequently than did males reared without older siblings. Maternal behaviour was not affected by pre-separation social experience. The presence of older siblings resulted in increased separation weight of prairie vole pups. In the present study, the direct benefit to pups from large size at separation suggests an important mechanism promoting indirect fitness benefits to philopatric prairie voles.

TI NONRANDOM MATING IN A PARASITIC WORM - MATE CHOICE BY MALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rats, Rattus norvegicus, were each infected with 30 female and either one or two male larvae of the parasite Moniliformis moniliformis (Acanthocephala). After an experimental period of 5 weeks, some of the female worms has been inseminated. Inseminated females were on average longer than uninseminated ones and occupied more anterior locations in the host''s small intestine. As both of these features are associated with high fecundity, the pattern of mating adopted by male worms is consistent with the maximization of reproductive success. Insemination was non-random with respect to female size only in those populations where the male and female worms were relatively similar in length. In populations in which the female worms were all much longer than the males, no significant differences in the size of inseminated and uninseminated females were found. Although several mechanisms could account for the patterns observed in the experiments, the evidence presented is most consistent with the hypothesis of active mate choice by males.

TI SONG AND CALL LEARNING IN WILD ZEBRA FINCHES IN SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sons of wild zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were studied for three breeding seasons at a colony in south-east Australia to determine if they learnt their father''s songs and distance calls. Sons, but not fathers, were captured and placed temporarily in an aviary located within the nest bushes of the colony during or after the sensitive phase for song learning (35-65 days); songs and calls were recorded at or after day 100 and the birds released. Distance Calls and the elements that  constituted the song phrases of 40 sons and their 20 fathers were recorded and compared in matching tests; sons were also matched with controls whom they encountered during the sensitive phase. Some songs elements could match by chance alone so it was necessary to distinguish those matching scores due to chance from those higher scores that indicated a possible tutor-pupil relationship. Likely tutors for 24 sons were identified: 17 were the sons'' own fathers, four were controls and two may have  learnt from either. Aviary confinement isolated sons from their fathers'' tuition so that the younger the sons that were confined, the lower their matching scores with the father. In the only family that spanned three generations, song phrases were transmitted with good accuracy. The Distance Call, which also formed an element in the song phrase, was learnt from the father by 72% of sons. Songs and Distance Calls were individually stereotyped over intervals of many months. Opportunities in  nature for song learning from the father are discussed.

TI SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS OF FLEDGLING BUDGERIGARS, MELOPSITTICUS-UNDULATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The social relationships of newly independent domesticated budgerigars were studied from 1 day to 3 weeks after fledging. Birds were kept in large, outdoor flight cages, so that juveniles fledged into flocks containing many unfamiliar juveniles and adults. When measured on a per available bird basis, fledglings initiated more social interactions than expected with their siblings and their fathers, and many fledglings formed a mutual affiliative relationship with one of their siblings (a  partner). Rates at which juveniles initiated social interactions with various categories of flock-mates were studed using principal components analyses; social initiations to fathers and unfamiliar adults and juveniles loaded on one factor, while social initiations to mothers and siblings loaded with opposite signs on a second factor. Conversely, fledglings attracted more social initiations from their siblings, fathers and other fledglings than expected on a per available bird basis. Principal components analyses of social initiations directed by other birds to new fledglings gave no indication that some individuals were generally more attractive to flock-mates than were other individuals. Patterns of social activity for the first 3 weeks were comparable for male and female fledglings, and were unrelated to fledging order. However, family size did affect early social behaviour. Fledglings from broods of one (singletons) tended to initiate and receive more social interactions from  parents and strangers than did fledglings with siblings, and individuals from larger families interacted more per unit time with siblings than did birds from smaller families. These results suggest that early social relationships in some birds may be at least as complex as those previously described for mammalian species.

TI MATE-CHOICE CRITERIA OF IPSWICH SPARROWS - THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIABILITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mate choice of female Ipswich sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis princeps, was investigated with respect to a measure of territory quality (size) and a measure of male quality (singing vigour). These two measures were not correlated. Females used both territory size and male song rate to choose mates, but the importance of each trait differed between the 2 study years. In each year, the trait that varied more among males was more important in mate choice. Thus, it appears that mate choice criteria must not only be reliable but also sufficiently variable, although it is not known whether variability is important because it contributes to reliability or because more variable traits are more easily assessed.

TI MODELS FOR SONG LEARNING IN THE ZEBRA FINCH - FATHERS OR OTHERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous research with individually caged breeding pairs of zebra finches, Taenopygia guttata, led to the conclusion that young males imprint upon their fathers at an early age, and model their songs upon their fathers'' songs. In this study, an aviary containing 10 breeding pairs of zebra finches and two non-breeding males was observed while the offspring were raised to independence. The young remained in the colony until sexual maturity (90 days), when song learning is complete. The songs of  young males and their putative fathers were then analysed and compared. The mean number of syllables in the sons'' songs was greater than the number in the fathers'' songs. Portions of each adult male''s song were copied by at least one young male, but sons did not preferentially copy their putative father''s songs. The majority of the sons copied syllables from at least two of the adult males in the parental population. Two adult males were chosen as song models by a disproportionate number of young males; these two adult males had a greater number of interactions with fledglings and gave a greater amount of parental care to fledgings (including those that were not their own) than did the other adult males in the colony. Young male zebra finches reared in a colonial environment are not restricted to one song model, but may instead make choices about which adult males to copy and, hence, how to represent themselves through their own songs. Likewise, adult males may be able to pass on their songs without successfully reproducing.

TI A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPOSITION AND SIZE OF GREAT TIT SONG
   REPERTOIRES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The size of the song repertoire of great tits, Parus major, was examined in relation to the variation within a repertoire of three song measures (proportion of sound in a phrase, frequency and phrase duration) and to the composition of a repertoire (the song types that constitute a repertoire). Larger song repertoires were more variable. Song types with either a high proportion of sound or a high frequency were more frequently used by males with large repertoires (five to seven song types)  than by males with small repertoires (two to four song types). Song types with either a low proportion of sound or a low frequency were used by all individuals in the study population. A comparison of field data and random simulations suggested that factors other than random learning of song types could affect the composition of a bird''s repertoire. It is proposed that, besides learning opportunities and learning ability, constraints in singing ability influence the composition and/or size of  great tit song repertoires.

TI THE REGULATION OF COMPLEX BUILDING BEHAVIOR IN THE PAPER WASP,
   POLISTES-FUSCATUS (INSECTA, HYMENOPTERA, VESPIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper wasp. Polistes fuscatus, builds its nest by both linear and non-linear construction. Linear construction follows a set sequence of building acts, while non-linear construction can be performed with any of several building acts at a given time. We report on the building programme regulating the non-linear phase of construction and discuss its relevance to the construction behaviour of othe species. New cell placement is influenced by distance to the substrate, the location of  nearest-neighbour cells (older cells on which the new cell is initiated), the groove between nearest-neighbour cells, orientation of comb and gravity. Gravity also influences many aspects of cell shape, and more cells tend to be added to the lower side of a tilted comb. Amputating one-half of one antenna from wasps demonstrated that the antennae are used for many of the measurements required during construction. Cell lengthening is initially done at a constant rate. Once the larvae become third  instars, however, cell lengthening is regulated by larval growth. Wasps use two methods to repair holes in a cell wall: (1) patching and (2) tearing down the wall and rebuilding it. The time to repair decreases with subsequent holes, and some wasps clearly show an improvement in repair technique with experience, suggesting that some learning is involved. The cues triggering the addition of pulp to the petiole, the substrate and the pupal caps and secondary petiole construction were also  investigated. These activities are infrequently performed and only specific cues could induce some of them. The decision process involved in non-linear construction can be represented by a non-overlapping branching hierarchy of choice levels. At each construction choice level, multiple cues are evaluated either simultaneously or in a hierarchical manner. Evidently, the more complex nest construction becomes (non-linear construction, multiple building materials, etc.), the more sophisticated the  building programme must be. Hierarchical levels of evaluation, sub-routines within the building programme, and learning capabilities appear to be ways of achieving this sophistication.

TI SHIFT IN RED FOX, VULPES-VULPES, MATING SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH EL-NINO
   IN THE BERING SEA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Fifteen reproductive groups of red foxes were observed on Round Island, Alaska during five field seasons. Polygyny occurred among these foxes, correlated with abundant food resources. The predictions of the polygyny threshold model were supported, i.e. polygynous females had equal or better reproductive success than monogamous females. However, beginning in 1982, widespread nesting failure of seabirds occurred (the primary prey item of the foxes), corresponding with the occurrence of El Nino in  the Bering Sea. This change in food resources apparently caused red foxes to switch their diet from the most abundant to rarer prey species, and caused a shift from facultative polygyny to monogamy within this population.

AB Total, shared parental investment, measured in terms of forsaking digging sites to soliciting offspring, did not increase with brood size in foraging greater snow geese, Chen caerulescens atlantica. Individual levels of solicitation by brood members decreased with an increase in brood size. This may result from the higher occurrence of attacks by parents on offspring that was observed in larger broods. This is interpreted as an indication of greater parent-offspring conflict over shared  parential investment in larger broods.

TI PREIMAGINAL EXPERIENCE AND NESTMATE BROOD RECOGNITION IN THE CARPENTER
   ANT, CAMPONOTUS-FLORIDANUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Worker larve of the carpenter ant were reared from the first instar to pupation in the presence of workers and pupae from a foreign colony. Following metamorphosis to adulthood, they were transferred to a group of workers and pupae from a different colony. When offered a pupa from each colony at 5-7 days post-emergence, the experimental workers preferentially licked paupae of the colony with which they were familiarized during larval experience. At later ages, they exhibited no significant preference. These results are consistent with the transient influence of pre-imaginal experience on nestmate brood recognition previously reported in the ant Cataglyphis cursor. However, control C. floridanus workers, familiarized with a single colony during both larval and adult experience, licked pupae from that colony and pupae from an unfamiliar colony without preference. In a second control experiment, older workers taken directly from their natal colony also failed to lick nestmate pupae preferentially, but did pick up and retrieve them significantly eariler than non-nestmates, suggesting that licking may not be an adequate measure of recognition. Colony recognition learned during larval life could be enhanced by a temporary estrangement, after which workers exhibited a preference for pre-imaginally familiar brood that might not otherwise be manifest.

TI THE FUNCTION OF THE MATING PLUG IN THE CHALCEDON CHECKERSPOT BUTTERFLY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB After mating, males of many species of butterflies seal the female''s copulatory opening with a ''mating plug''. We examined the proximate function of this mating plug in the chalcedon checkerspot butterfly, Euphydryas chalcedona (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Using interactions between free-flying males and six groups of treated females, we assessed the role of the mating plug in (1) physically preventing copulation, (2) signaling that the female has mated, and (3) inducing female mate-refusal behaviour. Males approached, landed and courted females in the manipulated and control groups with equal frequency in the field. Mating plugs did not reduce courtship persistence. When transplanted to virgin females, mating plugs usually prevented copulation, even though the females were still receptive. Mating plugs did not influence female behaviour. On the other hand, mated females became refractory immediately following mating and rarely copulated with males, even when their mating plugs  were removed. Refractory behaviours of females acted in concert with mating plugs within one day of mating. However, the fact that the mating plug impedes copulation when females are receptive suggests that conflict may arise between females and their prior mates. Some females that would otherwise remate after digesting the first male''s spermatophore may still be prevented from doing from doing so because of the mating plug.

TI HIGH-FREQUENCY CLICKS OF HAWAIIAN PICTURE-WINGED DROSOPHILA SPECIES

AB In this study, it is shown that the males of several picture-winged Drosphila subgroup species produce high-frequency clicking sounds when courting females. At the beginning of the courtship, the males may semaphore or vibrate their wings with a large amplitude, producing no audible sounds. After these ''preliminary'' wing vibrations the males set their wings backwards in a normal resting position and vibrate them with a small amplitude, producing loud clicking sounds (up to 14000 cps), which  differ from all Drosphila sounds described so far in both their spectral and their temporal structure. When producing these sounds the males always touch the abdomen of the female with their front legs, which might help the females receive the sounds as vibrational signals.

Crabs appeared unable to distinguish between a previously rejected shell and a novel shell bysight or contact alone but they actively investigated a previously  rejected shell for less time than they did a novel shell. The data indicate that it is the shell itself that is recognized, not the location of the shell. The longer the interval between two investigations of the same shell the less was the reduction in the duration of active investigation. These data are discussed with reference to optimal mechanisms for shell acquisition.

TI TIME-AND-PLACE LEARNING BY GARDEN WARBLERS, SYLVIA-BORIN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The ability of birds to learn associations between temporal and spatial changes in the daily pattern of food availability was investigated. Five captive garden warblers were trained to go from a central living room to four different feeding places, each one offering food for 3 h at different times of day. The birds reached their asymptotic level of correct choices (choosing the place with food availability) of 70% within 11 days. On test-days with food accessible in all places and at all times of day, the daily spatial and temporal patterns of feeding still persisted, showing that some kind of timing mechanism is involved.

TI STRIKING PREY CREATES A SPECIFIC CHEMICAL SEARCH IMAGE IN RATTLESNAKES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rattlesnakes, Crotalus viridis, struck mouse carcasses misted with water or with diluted perfume. Envenomated carcasses were removed, and later the snakes were presented with a pair of non-envenomated carcasses, each misted with one of these liquids. Snakes preferred the carcass with the same odour as the prey that was struck, even when the test occurred 60 min after the predatory strike. Under natural circumstances, rodents may acquire distinct chemical identities through their diet. In further tests, snakes preferred carcasses of mice that had been eating the same diet as the mouse that had been struck. These results indicate that rattlesnakes rapidly acquire chemical information from rodent prey during predatory strikes and use this information in subsequent search for prey.

TI BEHAVIORAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FISH PREDATORS AND THEIR PREY - EFFECTS
   OF PLANT-DENSITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Prey-specific anti-predatory behaviour under different degrees of structural complexity determines forging success of predators. The behaviour of piscivorous fish (largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, and northern pike, Esox lucius) and their prey (bluegills, Lepomis macrochirus, and fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas) were quantified in 60-min experiments in laboratory pools (2.4 m in diameter, 0.5 m deep) with artificial vegetation at densities of 0, 50, 250 and 1000 stems/m2. Largemouth bass switched predatory tactics from searching to ambushing as plant density increased whereas northern pike always used ambushing. At high plant density, both predators captured minnows, but not bluegills. Bluegills modified their behaviour more than minnows in response to predators, thereby avoiding predation at high plant densities. Structural complexity alone did not always provide refuge for prey; prey must use the structure to avoid predators. Predators may seek vegetated areas if appropriate, vulnerable prey are present.

TI MATE CHOICE AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF PIKAS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Factors affecting mate choice and female reproductive success were studied in a population of pikas, Ochotona princeps, in northeastern Oregon [USA]. Features of the den habitat (number of entrances to the den, size of the surrounding talus, distance to vegetation, amount of grass and forb present) and the mate or potential mate (weight and age) were analysed with respect to their effects on offspring production and survival, maternal survival and female mate choice. Female pikas chose mates primarily on the basis of the type of den available and the distance from the den to vegetation. These features were the primary determinants of the number of young weaned, but had no significant effects on maternal survival. Paternal weight was an important influence on offspring production, but its effect on female fitness was tempered by a negative effect on female survival. Characteristics important to female choice had no significant influence on the survival of young between weaning and natal dispersal and so cannot be considered to be male ''handicaps''. Male pikas tended to be philopatric so that sons of males with territories that were attractive to females tended to inherit the attractive territories of their fathers. Female choice among pikas is thus best explained by Darwin''s and Fisher''s theories of intersexual selection.

TI ACOUSTICALLY INDUCED CALL MODIFICATION IN THE WHITE-LIPPED FROG,
   LEPTODACTYLUS-ALBILABRIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The vocalization behaviour of Leptodactylus albilabris was investigated using field playback experiments. To assess the response of males to pre-recorded natural ''chirp'' (advertisement call) and natural ''chuckle'' (aggressive call) stimuli of gradually increasing broadcast intensity, three parameters (intensity, dominant frequency and repetition rate) of the chirp call were analyzed. Of the males tested, 69% showed a significant increase in chirp intensity with increased levels of both stimulus types. In response to playback of the chirp stimulus, males actively modified the dominant frequency of their chirp calls over a mean range of 91-42 Hz, and in one case as much as 400 Hz. Moreover, 12 of 17 males shifted the frequency of their call towards the dominant frequency of the chirp stimulus (2175 Hz) by either increasing or decreasing the dominant frequency of their chirp calls. In response to the natural chuckle stimulus, 83% of the males showed either a decrease or no significant change in the dominant frequency of their chirps. All eight males for which both the chirp frequency and intensity were analysed and that showed an increase in chirp intensity also showed a concomitant increase in chirp dominant frequency. These results are the first to document quantitatively the plasticity of advertisement call intensity and dominant frequency in an anuran. The possible effects of advertisement call modification on male mating success in L. albilabris is discussed.

TI PARENTAL CARE IN A TROPICAL NYMPHALID BUTTERFLY HYPOLIMNAS-ANOMALA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A tropical butterfly Hypolimnas anomala (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) straddles its eggs and guards them. Over 50% of the butterflies remained with their eggs until the eggs hatched. When butterflies were removed from their eggs, there was a significant increase in the number of eggs killed by predators compared to the number of eggs lost when the butterflies were left guarding them. Guarding was effective in reducing egg predation by several species of ants which were too small to remove the eggs whole, but was not effective against the ant Soloneopsis geminata, which was large enough to carry off whole eggs. The smaller ants were the most common predators at the sites studied. Guarding also did not deter parasitoids from attacking the eggs. Some of the butterflies remained associated with the newly hatched larvae for 1 or more days, until the larvae left the leaf. When the butterfly remained with the larvae, survival of the larvae increased during the 1-day period following hatching. Thus, parental care improved the survival of the eggs and very young larvae from 36% to 61%.

TI INTRASEXUAL AND INTERSEXUAL INTERACTIONS AT BREEDING BURROWS IN THE
   HORNED BEETLE, COPROPHANAEUS-ENSIFER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Coprophanaeus ensifer is a large horned beetle in which, in contrast to many other horned beetles, both males and females possess a long head horn. The species is a carrion feeder and has a developed nesting behaviour including provisioning the nest with larval food. Interactions between individuals at breeding burrows were observed in terraria. Both intra- and intersexual fights were common. In males fighting time was correlated with horn size. Although the horn size distribution of males  was platykurtic there was no clear evidence of dimorphism in behaviour. Males tried to copulate with all females but only a few attempts with large females resulted in a copulation. All males actively tried to copulate but larger males were more successful. In each experiment individuals starting nesting behaviour were usually the largest ones. The significance of body and horn size is discussed with special emphasis on female horns and fighting behaviour.

TI CONFUSION OVER RESIDENCY AND THE ESCALATION OF DAMSELFLY TERRITORIAL
   DISPUTES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Territorial contests among male Calopteryx maculata (Odonata) damselflies normally involve one or a few short (4-10 s) pursuits of an intruder by the resident. However, in a 3-year sample of 2005 bouts, 18.5% involved escalated, spiralling aerial chases that were significantly longer, some lasting several hours. These escalations usually occurred when two males shared the same territory but were rare in contests with intruders or with neighbouring territorial males. Escalations were most probably due to situations in which two males accidentally became residents in the same territory. This removed the ''residency'' asymmetry that appears to settle most territorial disputes in these damselflies. Using moving territories (oviposition sites), the ''confusion over residency'' hypothesis for escalation was tested experimentally. Bouts between males on adjacent, equally sized sites were escalated significantly in duration and intensity when their territories were merged. These experiments also showed that two alternative hypotheses, the ''male aggressiveness'' and ''valuable resource'' hypothesis, were not important general explanations of the escalation of contests.

TI FLEXIBILITY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HERON SIBLING AGGRESSION - AN
   INTRASPECIFIC TEST OF THE PREY-SIZE HYPOTHESIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sibling aggregation in nestling Ardeidae has been associated with a diet of monopolizably small prey items: in a Texas [USA] colony two egret species that eat small prey are sublicidal, while adjacent broods of great blue herons, Ardea herodias, eat very large prey and seldon fight. In a previous experiment these herons showed considerable developmental plasticity, acquiring egret-like behavior (direct feeding and fatal sibling aggression) when forest-reared on a small-prey diet. The prey-size hypothesis was further tested by studying a Quebec [Canada] colony of great blue herons that take small prey as their natural diet. As predicted, these nestlings fought much more than their Texas conspecifics (an increase of 800-900%) and learned to catch the discrete food boluses directly from the parent''s bill. Thus, early-hatched/senior brood members maintained a competitive advantage over younger siblings, even after losing their initial handling speed advantage, and they consumed disproportionate shares of the food. It is proposed that sibling aggression in this species is adaptively facultative, developing only when food is sufficiently small to be economically defended via aggression.

TI BREEDING AND FEEDING STRATEGIES IN DEER MICE AND HOUSE MICE WHEN FEMALES
   ARE CHALLENGED TO WORK FOR THEIR FOOD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, and house mice, Mus domesticus=musculus were challenged to reproduce while working for their food. Animals were subjected to one of several increasingly greater work requirements by using a caging system in which a food-pellet dispenser was controlled by wheel-running activity. Locomotor behaviour, food consumption and body weights were assessed continuously during pre-reproduction, pregnancy and lactation. Peromyscus and Mus differed in the  magnitude and temporal dimensions of their locomotor effort; however, both species often ran for more wheel revolutions than necessary to generate the number of food pellets eaten, except during lactation when females invested all of their wheel-running into obtaining food. Peromyscus maintained greater body weights, supported greater litter masses, and produced more pups at weaning than their Mus counterparts, but Peromyscus also required less food per unit of mass than Mus. Most Peromyscus females maintained at the highest work levels did not attempt reproduction. Among Peromyscus that did become pregnant, litter size at birth and at weaning averaged five or six pups, regardless of feeding conditions. Peromyscus pups became increasingly stunted as females worked harder but obtained less food. Mus females allowed insemination and attempted lactation regardless of feeding conditions, but they routinely cannibalized offspring throughout the first 12 days of lactation. Thus, as litter size was reduced, most surviving Mus pups attained similar body weights at weaning. There was no evidence of sex-ratio adjustments in either species. In conclusion, Peromyscus females exhibited a rigid ''all-or-nothing'' reproductive response, typically increasing their feeding effort to support large litters, whereas Mus females eliminated pups to stabilize the energy burdens of lactation. The divergent energy-allocation strategies employed by female Peromyscus and Mus appear correlated with their respective tendencies for seasonally oriented versus opportunistic breeding in the wild.

TI TIMING OF REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR IN MALE MUSK TURTLES,
   STERNOTHERUS-ODORATUS - EFFECTS OF PHOTOPERIOD, TEMPERATURE AND
   TESTOSTERONE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Although male turtles are usually regarded as having a post-nuptial pattern of gonadogenesis (i.e. gonadal growth dissociated from time of mating), they do mate both in the spring (when testes are regressed, plasma testosterone levels are low, epididymides are enlarged, and temperature and daylength increasing) and the autumn (testes and epididymides are enlarged, plasma testosterone levels are elevated, and tempreature and daylength are decreasing). Therefore different proximate cues may operate in mediating male reproductive behaviour at different times of year. When temperature, photoperiod and testosterone levels were altered in male Sternotherus odoratus during the year in both laboratory and semi-field conditions, reproductive behaviour occurred more readily in autumn than in spring (the supposed major breeding period). Short daylength was the key environmental condition stimulating male sexual activity, while temperature changes ''fine-tuned'' this behaviour. Testosterone was  effective in stimulating male behaviour only under certain environmental conditions and males could become refractory to artificially elevated plasma testosterone levels.

TI CORRELATION OF FLEHMEN BY MALE SHEEP WITH FEMALE BEHAVIOR AND ESTRUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Flehmen by rams occurred after the ram sniffed urine voided by the female but each flehmen was very variable in both duration (range1-34 s) and intensity. The duration of each flehmen was not affected by the stage of the oestrous cycle of the female. Flehmen to urine occurred least often in the presence of the oestrous ewe due to the low occurrence of marking behaviour by the female at this time. Flehmen also occurred after the ram investigated the vulva of the ewe but such flehmens were always short (range 1-8 s). Again the duration of each flehmen was not greatly influenced by the reproductive state of the female. Flehmen following investigation of the vulva occurred most frequently on the day before oestrus. These observations support the hypothesis that flehmen by the ram is an olfactory mechanism for confirming the reproductive state of the ewe. The pheromone detected by flehmen appears to be produced in the vagina and carried in the urine.

There was also a positive correlation between post-fledging dispersal and status. In dividuals that had left their natal territory to join the flock had a lower status than those remaining at home. The effect of dispersal on status was also related to the time at which dispersing birds arrived in the flock. To distinguish between these two effects of dispersal, three groups of hand-reared birds were introduced into a flock during the winter. This experiment demonstrated that (1) dispersal was more important than other differences in determining the outcome of interactions, and (2) this effect of prior residence depended on the duration of an individual''s residence relative to that  of its competitors.

TI THE BEHAVIOR ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCCUPATION OF BREEDING SITE IN THE
   KITTIWAKE GULL RISSA-TRIDACYTLA - THE SOCIAL-STATUS OF LANDING BIRDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A study of the landings of individually colour-ringed kittiwakes at nest sites showed that two functionally distinct categories of pre- and post-landing behaviour were adopted according to the social status (owner versus non-owner) of the landing bird with regard to the site in question. Almost all the occurrences where the behaviour of the adult was inconsistent with its social status were either due to a progressive development (or challenging) of the bird''s status with respect to the landing site (56 cases), or the result of a conflicting situation (three cases). A diagram summarizing the behavioural stages in the ontogenetic process of acquiring site owner status (a fundamental stage in attaining breeding status) was established. It includes all the inconsistent situations observed. This shows that at every stage of the process the birds have different roles in the elaboration of the social environment of the colony.

TI ELEMENTS OF EUSOCIALITY IN COLONIES OF EUSTENOGASTER-CALYPTODOMA
   (SAKAGAMI AND YOSHIKAWA) (STENOGASTRINAE, VESPIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The wasp Eustenogaster calyptodoma is at the lower limit of social complexity with colonies predominantly of one or two females. Nevertheless, in this study there was a recognizable division of labour with the oldest female guarding the nest entrance while a younger female did most of the foraging for food. This division of labour was maintained in the absence of any obvious dominance relationship. There was a female-biased sex ratio which could enhance the advantage to a female of staying in  the maternal nest; however, colonies may be monogynous or polygynous and degrees of relatedness close or remote. Cooperation between females may therefore result from kinship effects or mutual interest in protection of nest and brood. Within a week of emergence, a young female generally left the nest to found a colony either by building her own nest or by usurping one plus its brood from another wasp. Usurping brood appears to be a method of acquiring assistance quickly in the running of the colony. The most advantageous action for a female therefore appears to be to found her own nest by usurping. Females failing to found probably return to the maternal nest. Factors promoting nest leaving probably include diluted degrees of relatedness between colony members due to polygyny and nest usurping as well as to unsatisfactory nest material.

TI AGE, REPRODUCTIVE VALUE, AND DOMINANCE-RELATED BEHAVIOR IN VERVET MONKEY
   FEMALES - CROSS-GENERATIONAL INFLUENCES ON SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND
   REPRODUCTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behavioural interactions among captive socially-living adult female vervet monkeys were analysed to determine whether (1) the motivation to maintain and increase dominance rank declines with age as individual reproductive value declines, or (2) the cross-generational inheritance of dominance rank causes adult females to continue to involve themselves in dominance-related behaviours for the benefit of their daughters, even though their own reproductive value is declining. The results indicate that adult females do ot reduce their involvement in aggressive and dominance-related behaviours as they age. There was strong support for the hypothesis that older adult females maintain affiliative and supportive ties with their adult daughters, and that the daughters benefit from this relationship both in terms of social relationships and reproductive success. Young adult females without mothers were the recipients of more aggression, were less likely to be defended when they were attacked and were less likely to challenge the rank of others compared to females with mothers living in the group. Young adult females with mothers produced significantly more surviving offspring and had a lower level of infant mortality than comparable adult females without mothers.

TI STEP-FATHERING IN THE ANEMONEFISH AMPHIPRION-CLARKII - A REMOVAL STUDY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males were removed artificially from 33 brooding pairs in a population of the anemonefish Amphiprion clarkii living in the warm temperate waters off Japan. Two-thirds of them were replaced by foreign males before the eggs disappeared or hatched. A total of 17 replacement males cared for the foster eggs with the remaining females, and in five pairs the males assumed nearly full responsibility for caring for the eggs, in the same way as males in natural pairs. The most characteristic interaction between the female and replacement male was butting by the former and substrate-biting by the latter in the close proximity of the nest. It appeared that, by butting, the females were persuading or compelling their new mates to undertake the egg-care duty. It was concluded that step-fathering by the replacement male is payment for pairing with the female.

   PYRRHOSOMA-NYMPHULA - OUTCOME OF ENCOUNTERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behaviour of final-instar larvae of the aquatic predator Pyrrhosoma nymphula (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) during laboratory-staged territorial interactions is described. Occupants, as distinct from intruders, won 72% of encounters. The behaviour of occupants during contests won by intruders was more like that of intruders during all contests than that of occupants during contests won by occupants. Contest outcome was little affected by either size differences between the contestants or the use of the Labial strike. Contest duration was noted correlated with outcome, with size differences between contestants or with the use of the Labial strike. Winners and losers differed significantly in the number of acts used during encounters won by occupants (losers using more acts), but not during encounters won by intruders. Winners and losers also differed in their use of the behavioral acts Slow wave, Lateral display and Lamellae swipe during contests won by occupants, but not during contests won by intruders. The results are discussed in terms of the asymmetric war of attrition.

TI DIURNAL AND CLIMATIC INFLUENCES ON ALLOGROOMING BEHAVIOR IN A CAPTIVE
   GROUP OF JAVA MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study was aimed at evaluating diurnal and climatic influences on allogrooming in a small captive group of Java monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Allogrooming showed a definite diurnal cycle similar to those previously reported for other Macaca species. The major amount of allogrooming was recorded between 1300 hours and 1500 hours with a second minor peak occurring between 1100 hours and 1200 hours. The lowest mean levels were recorded in the early morning and in the late afternoon.  Climatic factors were shown to influence allogrooming: more allogrooming was done under conditions of high temperature and low relative humidity. On the basis of the discrepancy between this latter finding and that previously reported for Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) living under similar conditions, it is suggested that the sensitivity of Java monkeys to climatic factors may be a species-specific trait.

TI MONOGAMY AND BROOD PARASITISM - AN UNLIKELY PAIR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Intensive observation of a population of brood parasitic brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), including 114 marked birds, demonstrated that monogamy is the prevalent mating system. Analysis of 1280 consort events and 73 copulations showed that nearly all copulations were between a female and the male most often seen with her, even though females had ample opportunities to mate with other males. Although monogamy prevails, some pair bonds do not endure throughout the breeding season. They  are more unstable during the early season when resident cowbirds are establishing their social interrelations. This study provides strong evidence that the cowbird''s mating system varies geographically, as the only previous study based on observed copulations demonstrated promiscuity. Current hypotheses for the evolution of avian mating systems, when considered in light of the field data presently available, do not fully explain the adaptive significance of monogamy in a parasitic bird.

AB Honey bees learn to recognize flowers on the basis of their odour, colour, and pattern. Previous work had suggested that a flower''s pattern is remembered by virtue of several abstract parameters such as spatial frequency, rather than as pictures, but the evidence was not conclusive. New experiments strongly suggest that bees can remember patterns as low-resolution pictures; the resolution is roughly 10.degree.. Control experiments further indicate that flower learning can also involve conditioned inhibition.

TI LOW-FREQUENCY SOUND COMMUNICATION BY MOUSE PUPS (MUS-MUSCULUS) -
   WRIGGLING CALLS RELEASE MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Low-frequency calls (wriggling calls), emitted mainly between days 2 and 15 after birth by mouse pups while pushing for the teats during suckling by the mother, are studied with regard to their significance in intraspecific communication. Wriggling calls release maternal behaviour and ''attention'' responses in the mother. Licking of the pups is the most prominent maternal response, followed by changes of suckling position and by nest building. One function of the wriggling calls is to keep those maternal behaviours at a high level: otherwise their spontaneous rates of occurrence would decrease rapidly after the birth of the pups. Maternal and attention responses can be released in females lying on paralysed pups by playbacks of wriggling calls. The behavioural contexts of the production of wriggling calls and pure ultrasounds are mutually exclusive and the perception and recognition of each type of pup call cannot be confused by the mother.

TI REPRODUCTIVE LIFE-HISTORY CORRELATES OF EARLY AND LATE SEXUAL-MATURATION
   IN FEMALE MONGOLIAN GERBILS (MERIONES-UNGUICULATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Age at vaginal introitus is bimodally distributed in female domesticated Mongolian gerbils; some exhibit vaginal perforation before eye-opening (day 16), others after weaning (day 25). We found early- and late-maturing female gerbils to differ significantly in reproductive life history. Early-maturing females first reproduced when younger, had more litter, with more young per litter, and consequently had more than twice as many offspring as late-maturing females. In comparison with  late-maturing females, early-maturing females gave birth to and weaned a greater proportion of females per litter and a higher proportion of early-maturing daughters per litter. Further, early-maturing females exhibited reduced maternal behaviour; they spent less time nursing their young and retrieved fewer offspring displaced from the nest than late-maturing females. Even under constant laboratory conditions, there were significant, correlated, circannual rhythms in female fecundity, the  proportion of males per litter and the proportion of early-maturing daughters per litter. Review of the field literature suggests that wild Mongolian gerbils may exhibit similar variability in reproductive pattern.

TI INTERSPECIFIC ODOR DISCRIMINATION BY A LIZARD (EUMECES-LATICEPS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When presented with odours on cotton swabs, adult broad-headed skinks (Eumeces laticep) of both sexes flicked their tongues at much higher rates to conspecific odour stimuli than to those of their most closely related congeners, E. fasciatus and E. inexpectatus, during 60-s exposures to cloacal odours from lizards of the opposite sex. A successive discrimination design was used in which each lizard responded to five different odour treatments in a random sequence. In addition to the three lizard odours, water was used as a measure of baseline tongue protrusion rates and a cologne was used as a pungency control. There were no significant differences among the four non-conspecific odour treatments in numbers of tongue flicks elicited, but the skinks emitted significantly greater numbers of tongue flicks to conspecific cloacal odours to any of the other stimuli. It is hypothesized that E. laticeps produces a pheromone which may function for species identification. Although it is  tempting to speculate that the pheromone may serve as a pre-mating mechanism for maintaining reproductive isolation from syntopic congeners, insufficient information is available to draw firm conclusions regarding such a function.

TI GROUP AND MATRILINE DIFFERENCES IN THE BEHAVIOR OF RHESUS-MONKEY INFANTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A ''Monte Carlo'' method was developed for characterizing matrilines of rhesus monkey infants (Macaca mulatta) born to their mothers within six similar captive social groups, according to behavioural measures, and for characterizing social groups according to their matrilines'' median scores. Eight- and 16-week-old infants differed according to their groups, but not according to their matrilines, in measures of their activity in the vicinity of their mothers, and the frequencies with which  social companions other than the mother initiated social contacts with them while they were out of contact with their mothers. Sixteen-week-olds differed according to their groups in the frequencies with which their mothers rejected them, and 8-week-old in the frequencies of the social contacts they initiated with companions other than mother while off their mothers. When tested with their mothers, in mildly disturbing situation away from other social companions, 52-week-olds differed according  to their group of origin in time spent out of contact with their mothers. Different groups were seen as producing infants differing in ''enterprise'' from their eighth week, in the sense of being ready to initiate social contacts with others while off their mothers, at 8 weeks, and of being off their mothers in the test at 52 weeks. Cases where the 8-week measures did not reflect infant enterprise could be explained in terms of other aspects of the relationships involving the infants and their mothers in the social group. In particular, matrilines differed consistently in dominance status, and some mothers also received high levels of aggression from other adults. Mothers receiving high levels of aggression were more responsible for maintaining proximity with their 8-week-old infants, and their 8-week-olds were less often involved in social contacts with others.

TI COMPETITIVE AND MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS AMONG FEMALES IN A NEOTROPICAL
   ORIOLE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female yellow-rumped caciques (Cacicus cela) compete for access to nest sites that are safe from predators. Weight is the major factor determining female fledging success since heavier females tend to win aggressive encounters and control the best nest sites. Long-term residents are less aggressive towards each other and nest close together in interwoven clusters from which they exclude most newcomers. Resident females achieve higher nesting success than newcomers because they can fit more  nests in the safest positions within colonies. However, the advantages of increasing residence with age are offset by a loss of weight as females grow older. Hence, there is no net effect of age on nesting success. These results emphasize the importance of both competitive and mutualistic interactions in determining the distribution of individuals within and between habitats. Competitive interactions may be widespread in species with limited nesting habitat, and mutualistic interactions might  be expected where there are advantages to clustering nests within the available habitat.

TI EXTRA-PAIR MATINGS AND MATE GUARDING IN THE COMMON MURRE URIA-AALGE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Forced extra-pair copulations (FEPC) are frequent and mate guarding well developed among common murres. Male murres were at the colony almost continuously through the pre-laying period, but females were present only infrequently, and the frequency of FEPCs was significantly correlated with the relative number of males present. Males vigorously defended their partners from other males and females attempted to resist-extra-pair matings. Females whose mates were absent were particularly vulnerable to FEPCs. The number of extra-pair copulations performed by males was estimated to vary between 0-32/season. The reproductive successes of males not performing FEPC, and those performing at the mean and maximum rate are estimated. Males most active in FEPC may substantially increase their reproductive success compared with males not performing FEPC. Ecological conditions in the common murre probably favor prolonged sperm storage, which in turn provides opportunities for sperm competition and favors both effective mate guarding and extra-pair copulations.

TI INCREASED QUEEN-LIKE BEHAVIOR OF WORKERS IN LARGE COLONIES OF THE SWEAT
   BEE LASIOGLOSSUM-ZEPHYRUM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations were made on Lasioglossum zephyrum colonies containing from one to 17 workers. In experiment I, the most dominant workers in larger colonies exhibited more queen-like characteristics in their interactions with nestmates than did those in smaller colonies. In experiment II, a higher proportion of workers in large than in small colonies were willing to mate with males. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the queen''s ability to suppress queen-like behavior in workers declines with increasing colony size.

TI INFANTICIDE AS AN EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE STRATEGY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) analysis of infanticide, expressed as 2 pure strategies, shows that the equilibrial frequency of infanticide depends on only 2 parameters: the relative advantage of infanticide when others are also infanticidal and the relative advantage of a non-infanticidal strategy if others are non-infanticidal. The possible equilibrial conditions of strictly infanticidal, strictly non-infanticidal, stably polymorphic or history-dependent populations correspond to various earlier models of infanticide. These earlier models may be subsumed as special cases of the ESS analysis. This permits the comparison of alternative theories of infanticide in specific cases of infanticide in natural populations. In particular, it is argued that if infanticide confers a relative advantage on the perpetrator when other population members are non-infanticidal, this is sufficient to reject a ''maladaptive'' explanation for infanticide. The potential existence of history-dependent equilibria suggests there will be extreme difficulty with non-experimental methods that attempt to test the adaptiveness of infanticidal behavior.

TI THE DETECTION OF CRYPTIC PREY BY BLUE JAYS (CYANOCITTA-CRISTATA) .1. THE
   EFFECTS OF TRAVEL TIME
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB THe behaviour of blue jays (Cyaonocitta cristata) hunting for dispersed, cryptic prey was investigated in an operant simulation in which jays were trained to search projected images for noctuid moths. Each image contained either a single moth or no moth. Each trial was structured so as to simulate travelling between patches, searching within patches, and attacking and handling each moth that was detected. In two experiments in which the travel time between patches was manipulated, increases in travel time produced increased persistence within patches. Although this qualitative effect was predicted by the marginal value theorem, quantitative analyses revealed that the blue jays were using a strategy that was more sophisticated and more efficient than the simple time-in-patch rule implied by the marginal value theorem.

TI SEXUAL SELECTION AND ADULT MALE ORANGUTAN LONG CALLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Long calls given by adult male orangutans (P. pygmaeus) are hypothesized to mediate interindividual spacing among male orangutans and to attract female orangutans to high-ranking mates over long distances. To test these hypothesies observations of calling behavior and a series of experimental playbacks of recorded long calls were conducted. The findings were consistent with the male-spacing hypothesis but did not support the mate-attraction hypothesis. Experimental playbacks demonstrate that  long calls regulate spacing between males through an approach-avoidance system based on dominance relationships: the highest-ranking adult male approaches calls, while lower-ranking males avoid calls. The results of playbacks also reveal that sexually active females do not move toward long calls, and therefore do not indicate that long calls function in attracting mates. Female mate choice may not have been an important selective factor during the evolution of long calls.

TI FIELD PLAYBACK OF LOUD CALLS TO GIBBONS (HYLOBATES-LAR) - TERRITORIAL,
   SEX-SPECIFIC AND SPECIES-SPECIFIC RESPONSES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An experimental study of territoriality among monogamous lar gibbons (H. lar) was performed scoring vocal and movement responses to field playback of their loud calls. Playback of neighboring groups; male-female duets on territory borders, and of these duets and music controls in territory centers, indicated a general territorial response. Responses to playback of a strange males'' solo and of a strange female''s solo in territory centers indicated that resident males would evict deeply intruding males and pairs but not necessarily females, and that resident females would evict deeply intruding females but probably not males or pairs. Vocal responses also implied that, although males carry the burden of routine territory defense in border disputes involving chases and special calls, the female part of the daily duet also contributes to routine exclusion of outside females. Responses of lar females to playback of the solo of a female capped gibbon (H. pileatus) suggested that the females of one species cannot sex the calls of females of the other species. This could partly account for the existence of bigamous mixed-species groups at the interface between the 2 species. This result also implies that female calls contribute to routine exclusion of conspecific females, and thus to the maintenance of monogamy.

TI RELEASE OF MALE COURTSHIP DISPLAY IN PERIPLANETA-AMERICANA - EVIDENCE
   FOR FEMALE CONTACT SEX-PHEROMONE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male American cockroaches (P. americana) are attracted to virgin females by volatile sex pheromones. After antennal contact with the female they turn through 180.degree. and spread their wings in courtship display. A chemical contact stimulus releasing male courtship is demonstrated in the female cuticle. Experiments with standardized olfactory stimulation by volatile sex pheromones revealed that the contact stimulus is sex-specific and species-specific. It can be washed off the cuticle with non-polar solvents and was successfully treansferred to glass dummies. It is not effective in the absence of volatile sex pheromones. Volatile sex pheromones are responsible for male attraction and sexual motivation, while mate recognition is accomplished through the contact pheromone.

TI HUNTING BEHAVIOR OF THE PERLID STONEFLY NYMPH DINOCRAS-CEPHALOTES
   (PLECOPTERA) UNDER DIFFERENT LIGHT CONDITIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The hunting behavior of D. cephalotes nymphs was studied during 2 different light intensities, darkness and twilight (0.1 cd m-2). Nymphs of the mayfly Baetis rhodani were provided as food. In darkness the predator moved slowly without stopping, encountering the prey with the antennae and the hair fringes on the tibiae. Little time was spent in a shelter. There was little tendency to pursue the prey after a missed first attack and the pursuing distance was short. In twilight the speed of the predator was higher and the movement was interrupted by long periods of rest. The number of successful attacks was higher and more attacks were initiated when the predator was immobile. Time of activity outside the shelter was short. There was a greater tendency to pursue the prey after a missed first attack and the pursuing distance was longer compared with that in darkness. There are 2 main advantages of changing strategy from ''searcher'' in darkness to ''ambusher'' in the light: to avoid  being detected by predators hunting by vision and to avoid being detectedby potential prey species relying on visual cues for the detection of predators. The optical design of the eye revealed that only those parts of the eye directed upwards and backwards were optimized to the light conditions at which the predator preferred to be active, suggesting that the main function of these areas is to detect predators, though an additional gain in detecting prey could also be seen.

TI POPULATION RECOGNITION OF INFANT ISOLATION PEEPS IN THE SQUIRREL-MONKEY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Infants from the three populations of squirrel monkeys with different pelage, behavior patterns and physiological patterns emitted two forms of isolation peeps. Offspring from Peruvian and Bolivian stock produced isolation peeps previously described as belonging to ''Roman Arch'' monkeys whereas the Guyanese population produced isolation peeps previously described as belonging to ''Gothic Arch'' monkeys. Playbacks of isolation peeps from infants of each population to groups of adult monkeys  revealed a population specificity in the response to infant call.s Peruvian and Bolivian adults responded with increased activity, decreased huddling and increased approach to the speaker only when isolation peeps of Peruvian and Bolivian infants were broadcast. Guyanese adult monkeys showed similar responses to the isolation peeps of Guyanese infants. These are the first reported data indicating that the long-recognized vocal differences in squirrel monkey populations are responded to differentially. The results also support a major taxonomic division between the Gothic Arch and Roman Arch populations with the other morphological and physiological differences within these populations reflecting secondary divisions.

AB In many species the sexes may differ in their contribution to the production and care of offspring. Previous theory and observations have shown that the sex which contributes least will also be the sex with the highest variance in mating success. I show that this phenomenon can result from random mating. Bateman''s (1948) experiment showed that male Drosophila melanogaster were more variable in their mating success than were females. This additional variability is usually attributed to intra-male competition and female choice but I show that this phenomenon can result from random mating.

TI FACTORS LIMITING POLYGYNY IN THE WILLOW PTARMIGAN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Willow ptarmigan (L. lagopus) usually pair monogamously and males invest more in vigilance and parental care than do males of other grouse species. To test whether polygyny is rare because male parental care is necessary for successful reproduction, males were removed continually to skew the operational sex ratio, inducing polygyny, and then the breeding success and survival were compared among females that shared a mate and those that did not. Both groups had similar clutch sizes, laid eggs at the same time, produced young of the same weight, and fledged similar numbers of juveniles. Hens that shared a mate suffered higher losses of nests during incubation, and fewer returned to the breeding range in subsequent years. Thus, although male parental care was not essential, it did improve female reproductive success and survival. Willow ptarmigan are not polygynous probably because territorial females are able to prevent potential secondary hens from settling, thus securing unshared access to male investment and territorial resources.

TI SONG LEARNING AND DECEPTIVE MIMICRY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Payne (1978, 1981a, 1982) suggested that young males of some bird species copy the songs of the previous occupant or the songs of local established males when setting up a territory and thereby increase their likelihood of success. According to this view, song copying is a form of deceptive mimicry. First-year great tits do not share more songs than expected with the previous occupants of their territories, nor are shared songs used more often than other songs in their repertoires. Songs are shared with neighbors but not selectively with established neighbors and those sharing with 1st-yr neighbors. The general applicability of the deceptive mimicry hypothesis is discussed. Song sharing between neighbors probably can be advantageous for reasons other than deceptive mimicry.

TI MALE CONTESTS FOR TERRITORIES AND FEMALES IN THE FLY DRYOMYZA-ANILIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB D. anilis males defend the small carcasses on which females oviposit as well as the females themselves during copulation and oviposition. Contests over territories and females were compared to assess the way different asymmetries affect the outcome of a struggle. In contests over females with a lot of eggs the rate of take-over was lower than in contests over immature females, but the size of the female or her size relative to the owner did not affect the outcome. In territorial disputes the initiation of an attack had no effect. The most important asymmetry in contest for both females and territories was the size difference between the opponents. A total of 53% of the contests over females and 39% of territorial struggles resulted in a take-over. In take-overs, owners were smaller than copulating males or territory owners on average. Take-overs are part of a process in which resource owners continue to change until one is strong enough to defend the resource successfully. Contests over females lasted significantly longer than those over territories, which suggests that for males females are more valuable than territories. This is to be expected as territories are of value because they ultimately increase the probability of obtaining females. A positional advantage or the higher payoff of the owner in disputes over females may be the reason for the lower rate of take-over in female defense than in territorial struggles between opponents of similar size.

TI A MOTIVATIONAL ANALYSIS OF OBJECT PLAY IN JUVENILE DWARF MONGOOSES
   (HELOGALE-UNDULATA-RUFULA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The dwarf mongoose (H. u. rufula) has a play vocalization, a short pulse at the 2-kHz level, which is repeated at a rate of 3-12 or more pulses/s during the entire play period. The repetition rate is indicative of motivation intensity. This motivational study on object play shows that: play becomes fragmented prior to termination; motivation changes during a session fall into 3 different patterns all terminating at a set point or sollwert; the behavior patterns performed during play show little sequencing related to original context, but are causally different from those of exploration and have optimum intensities; more limbs employed in object manipulation indicate higher intensity irrespective of the original non-play context of the behavior pattern concerned; and high intensity is coupled with more behavior patterns performed per time interval. Hand-reared isolates show a delay in the appearance of play in ontogeny in comparison with pair-raised animals and their play contains a higher frequency of patterns bringing the object into close bodily contact. Play is a behavior pattern complex with its own motivation which, through its performance, may compensate for motivational deficits or surpluses, a set point or sollwert replacing a consummatory act. Behavior patterns from other behavioral contexts are taken over and reordered with regard to different rules, hence the apparent lack of sequencing. A threshold of general excitation associated with stimulus input is  postulated as regulating the time of appearance of play in ontogeny, not maturational factors and it may be used to compensate for specific stimulatory deficits occurring during ontogeny.

TI VOCAL COMMUNICATION IN A NEOTROPICAL TREEFROG, HYLA-EBRACCATA -
   ADVERTISEMENT CALLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The vocal communication of H. ebraccata in central Panama was studied. The advertisement call of this species consists of a pulsed buzz-like primary note which may be given alone or followed by 1-4 secondary click notes. Primary notes highly stereotyped, showing little variation within or among individuals in dominant frequency, duration, pulse repetition rate or rise time. Males calling in isolation give mostly single-note calls. They respond to playbacks of conspecific calls by increasing  calling rates and the proportion of multi-note calls and by giving synchronized calls 140-200 ms after the stimulus begins. Responses to conspecific advertisement calls are usually given immediately after the primary note of the leading call, but the primary note of the response often overlaps with the click notes of the leading call. Experiments with synthetic signals showed that males synchronize to any type of sound of the appropriate frequency (3 kHz), regardless of the fine structure of the stimulus. Playbacks of synthetic calls of variable duration showed that males do not synchronize well to calls less than 150 ms long, but they do to longer calls (200-600 ms). The variance in response latency increased with increasing stimulus duration, but modal response times remained at around 140-200 ms. Similar results were obtained in experiments with synthetic calls having a variable number of click notes. Males showed no tendency to increase the number of click notes in their calls in response to increasing stimulus duration or increasing number of clicks in the stimulus. Females preferred 3-note to  1-note calls in 2-choice playback experiments, whether these were presented in alternation or with the 1-note call leading and the 3-note call following. Females showed no preference for leader or follower calls when both were 1-note. When 2-note calls were presented with the primary note of the follower overlapping the click note of the leader, females went to call in which click notes were not obscured. H. ebraccata respond to other males in a chorus in ways which enhance their ability to  attract mates.

TI EXTRA-PAIR COURTSHIP IN BLACK-BILLED MAGPIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male black-billed magpies (P. pica) in South Dakota [USA] were observed to repeatedly visit and court females other than their mates. In 57/92 cases observed, the intruding male was a paired bird from up to 2.5 km away, whose own female was usually already incubating her eggs. Females received higher rates of extra-pair visits during their fertile periods than either before or after; they typically responded by following and begging from the intruder. The timing of visits and the behavior of intruding males and visited females suggest that extra-pair copulations may have been the main objectives of both males and females, although no such copulations were seen. The limited evidence available suggests that the males which took part most often in extra-pair visits were older, more experienced males who had histories of fledging above average numbers of young. Guarding of fertile females by their mates suggests the evolution of strategies to counter extra-pair courtship and copulations.

TI THE ABILITY OF THE FROG-EATING BAT TO DISCRIMINATE AMONG NOVEL AND
   POTENTIALLY POISONOUS FROG SPECIES USING ACOUSTIC CUES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The bat Trachops cirrhosus eats frogs and uses the frogs'' vocalizations to locate them. It is able to discriminate between poisonous and palatable prey species on the basis of acoustic cues alone. Bats were presented with pairs of novel frog calls (i.e., calls with which the bats had no prior experience) which differed in the degree to which they were similar to the call of a local, poisonous species, Bufo typhonius. In all cases the bats were more often attracted to the call that was least similar to the call of B. typhonius. One call which was preferred when it was the member of 1 stimulus pair was avoided when it was the member of another pair. Bats seemed to classify the calls in a continuous fashion. This has interesting implications for the potential of frog vocal mimicry complexes to evolve under the influence of bat predation. Acoustic analysis of the calls suggests that discrimination was primarily based on temporal properties of the calls.

TI CENTRAL PLACE FORAGING BY SWALLOWS (HIRUNDINIDAE) - THE QUESTION OF LOAD
   SIZE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Some predictions of Orians et Pearson''s (1979) models for central place foragers (CPF) were tested with 3 spp. of swallows (Hirundinidae). House martins (Delichon urbica) and sand martins (Riparia riparia) brought larger food loads to the nest mainly when foraging distances were great; swallows (Hirundo rustica) gathered large loads when food was plentiful. For all 3 spp. the outcome conformed qualitatively with the predictions of the CPF models. Overall, house martins were the most sensitive to travel time effects, but in a quantitative test the predicted load size was 20-40% less than the observed size for a range of realistic travel times. Additional models are presented which emphasize the significance of foraging techniques and foraging costs for optimal load size in multiple prey loaders.

TI TOWARDS A THEORY OF THRESHOLDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Some authors studying feeding or drinking have assumed that the activity starts or stops when causal factors rise or fall to a given point. Apparently non-homeostatic behavior is then explained by adding more complex control mechanisms. Other authors, studying the interaction between activities, have assumed that activities compete so that 1 activity effectively sets the threshold for another. The latter view was embodied in a model animal described previously. Then model animal was used to simulate rat feeding and drinking behavior. Although its feedback loops are over-simple, the model exhibits some of the non-homeostatic behavior shown by rats. The complexities arising from competition between activities may need to be understood before further progress can be made in exploring homeostatic mechanisms.

TI FACTORS AFFECTING THE FORMATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PAIR BONDS IN THE
   ZEBRA FINCH, TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB There is evidence that the process of pair formation starts within minutes of the introduction of unfamiliar zebra finches. Males courted their eventual mates in preference to other females, and some females solicited their mates, during the 1st recording session of this study. The full establishment of the pair bond probably takes longer than this, because clumping and allopreening between mates were not usually recorded until the 2nd or 3rd day of introduction. Tactile contact between partners, or at least the opportunity for them to come close together, is important in bond formation, but established bonds can be maintained by auditory contact alone. Birds repair almost immediately in the total absence of the mate, but the formation of this new bond does not destroy the original one.

TI SOCIAL-RELATIONS BETWEEN FATHERS AND OFFSPRING IN A CAPTIVE GROUP OF
   RHESUS-MONKEYS (MACACA-MULATTA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Analysis of social relations between adult males and immatures of known paternity in a captive group of rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) revealed that fathers and offspring associated significatly more than other male-immature dyads. This association was highly variable, however, and there was no evidence of active preference for or investment in offspring by fathers. The tendency of offspring to approach fathers more often than other males appeared to account for the pattern of selective association. Preferential father-offspring association occurred whether or not mothers were in proximity to fathers, but mothers'' associations with males did predict their offspring''s, especially for the younger juveniles and the infants. It is possible that long-term social relationships between mothers and fathers lead to father-offspring association, but a yr-to-yr pattern of shifting mating preferences in the group weakens this hypothesis.

AB Shell fighting behavior of the hermit crab P. bernhardus was investigated. Analysis of fights between crabs in which there was little or no asymmetry in potential benefit for the 2 crabs from a shell exchange suggested that the duration of the fight increased as the potential benefit increased. Further experiments indicated that a naked crab was capable of evicting a housed crab by a process of direct aggression. Analysis of fights in which there was a slight asymmetry in potential gains from shell exchange indicated that the result of the fight was primarily determined by the larger of the 2 crabs. These results are contrary to the proposal of Hazlett (1978) that the interactions represent a process of negotiation rather than aggression.

TI THE ROLE OF ASYMMETRIES IN ANIMAL CONTESTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A game theoretical analysis is presented of animal contest situations which are asymmetric in more than 1 aspect: 2 opponents are imagined which differ in ownership status as well as in relative fighting ability. The following question is analyzed: which aspect may or must be used for conventional settlement in a population playing an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)? The contestants are fully informed about the asymmetric features. The assessment of relative fighting ability is unambiguous and without cost. This assumption of perfect information allows for a decomposition of the evolutionary game into subgames. An easy procedure for calculating the ESS is presented and simple models are analyzed. Payoff-irrelevant aspects are used for conventional settlement of a conflict even if payoff-relevant asymmetric aspects also exist. One of the aspects may be of such strong relevance that, no matter which ESS is played, animals must base their decisions on that dominant aspect. It may also occur that 2 different asymmetric features are each of strong payoff relevance for either of the opponents, such that they have no escalation-suppressing effect. The scenario of a conflict between an owner of a resource and an intruder is used to derive conclusions. [Examples are Agelenopsis aperta (spider), Papio hamadryas (baboon) and Uca pugilator (fiddler crab).].

   COOPERATIVE BREEDER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB During a 5 yr study of the cooperatively living acorn woodpecker M. formicivorus, 26 irruptions of agonistic behavior were observed involving large numbers of intruders invading a territory. These invasions are usually contests among potential immigrants for the opportunity to replace a missing group member (power struggles). Power struggles indicate intense competition among individuals to transfer out of their natal group. Such dispersal is not necessarily excluded by the hypothesis that individuals gain directly by living in cooperative groups through either increased foraging efficiency or better predator defense. Birds involved in power struggles expend energy and incur risks. These costs are an acceptable part of dispersal only if cooperative living is a result of birds being forced to remain in groups as a result of resource localization.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB The role of tongue extrusions was examined for the detection of chemicals in the iguanid lizard S. jarrovi, prior to the breeding season. Most extrusions resulted in the tongue touching the substrate and are referred to as tongue-touches. A total of 2819 tongue-touches were observed for 4 age/sex classes of lizards. The tongue was probably not involved in the detection of a natural predator, the Arizona kingsnake (Lampropeltis pyromelana), and it was not used to find food. It seemed to be involved in the exploration of temporally and spatially unfamiliar areas. The possibility that the tongue is involved in the detection of conspecifics is discussed. Possible marking attempts in the form of chin wipes, pelvic rubs and defecations were examined. The latter 2 possibilities were not important at this time of year. Chin wiping may result in the depositing of chemical markers, although no external chin glands were found and the possibility is still uncertain.

Infant stereotypies were elicited by a wide variety of contexts including non-alert states, interactions with the caregiver and other persons, feeding situations, object interest and kinesthetic changes. The frequency of stereotypy in all contexts was a function of age. Non-alert states and interactions with the caregiver were disproportionately associated with leg and torso stereotypies. The relationship between these human stereotypies and the function and control of stereotyped behavior in other species is discussed.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The amphipod crustacean M. gryllotalpa builds tubes on solid substrata. Mature animals usually reside in individual tubes. When more than 1 individual is present in a tube it is always a single heterogametic pair. Tube-sharing occurs with the greatest frequency 12 h before the female''s molt. Following the female''s molt, most males leave the tube. The pattern of tube-sharing is the behavioral analog of precopulation in epibenthic amphipods. No more than 2 individuals are found in a tube because one individual will probably not permit another individual of the same sex to cohabit the same tube, and the female determines the time of tube-sharing, for most females tube-share only shortly before they molt. After the male leaves the female''s tube he probably cruises from tube to tube until he gains entry into the tube of another receptive female.

AB Nulliparous RHA/Verh female rats (27) received a daily 6 min test in a familiar maze. The complex maze was of the Dashiell type and included a small illuminated central arena. These female rats patrolled the maze more rapidly at estrus than on either of the 2 days preceding or following estrus. General locomotor activity increased, body weight decreased and the frequency of entry into the illuminated maze center increased at estrus.

TI DISPLAY BEHAVIOR OF MALE ANOLIS-OPALINUS (SAURIA, IGUANIDAE) - CASE OF
   WEAK DISPLAY STEREOTYPY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A. opalinus lacks even one discrete display pattern. Syntopic with as many as 4 congeners, A. opalinus contradicts the hypothesis that increased stereotypy of species-recognition displays is favored among sympatric congeners. Head bobs (4-11) and dewlap pulses (0-8) varied per display. A re-occurring theme was isolated which explained the variable bob cadences of most displays (75%). This theme was an initial double head bob series, a middle bob series of successively quickening cadence, and a final bob series of successively slowing cadence. Sixteen display-related parameters were examined for intra-display correlations. All but a few correlations were non-significant. The unusual A. opalinus display behavior may have resulted from relaxed selection for stereotyped displays, with other features being used for mate selection and species recognition.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Cotton mice, P. gossypinus, display a copulatory pattern with no lock, no intravaginal thrusting, multiple ejaculations and ejaculations occasionally occurring without prior intromissions. There are relatively few ejaculations per satiety test. Mice from 2 distinct populations were very similar with respect to basic motor patterns, quantitative measures, and associated behavioral patterns, suggesting that these patterns may be truly species-typical. The behavior of the reciprocal hybrids between P. gossypinus and P. leucopus resembled that of the parental species.

TI SIMULTANEOUS COLOR DISCRIMINATION IN CHICKS IS IMPROVED BY BRIEF
   EXPOSURE TO LIGHT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Dark-reared chicks were exposed to white light for 1 h at age 24 h. At 48 h these chicks, and others kept in the dark throughout, were given the opportunity to obtain a heat reward by choosing the correct arm in a Y maze. The discriminanda were red and blue illuminated circles, each being the positive stimulus for half the chicks. Light-exposure resulted in faster learning, especially when the positive stimulus was blue. This is taken as further support for the view that brief exposure to light activates the visual system non-specifically, affecting many kinds of visually guided behavior.

TI ANTORBITAL AND FOREHEAD SECRETIONS OF BLACK-TAILED DEER
   (ODOCOILEUS-HEMIONUS-COLUMBIANUS) - THEIR ROLE IN AGE-CLASS RECOGNITION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male black-tailed deer (O. hemionus columbianus) scent mark with their forehead gland secretion and antorbital sac contents. When forehead and antorbital sections were presented on the same nylon rod on an artificial tree, male deer discriminated between male yearlings'' and fawns'' secretions. When the secretions were presented separately, male deer discriminated between yearlings forehead and antorbital secretions and blank controls. Discrimination was indicated by differential rates of sniffing and licking. The frequency of forehead rubbing of the scent marks appeared to be dependent on the dominance relationships of the male deer. Chemical evidence is presented which suggest that male yearlings'' and fawns'' antorbital secretions differ quantitatively. Females did not respond preferentially to these secretions and, with exception of sniffing, responded significantly less than males.

TI ATTACK AND DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR IN ALBINO-RAT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Attack of dominant colony males of an albino rat (Rattus norvegicus) strain, on introduced strangers, produced a non-random distribution of bites, with ventral trunk virtually never bitten. Vibrissae-contact of attacker and defender interfered with bites to the defender''s head and upper back. The specific agonistic reactions of attacking and defending rats appeared to involve strategies based on these limitations on attack: defenders utilized ''boxing'' and lying ''on-the-back'' behavior, which interposed ventral trunk and vibrissae between attacker and defender. The lateral display permitted attackers to circumvent the defender''s behavior. Limitations on attack therefore appeared to underlie the specific agonistic behavior of both attacking and defending rats.

TI CONTROL OF FOOD FLOW IN A SOCIETY OF ANT MYRMICA-RUBRA L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The control of prey, thin syrup and water flow, through a society of Myrmica was studied. Larval intake increased if they are deprived of prey, but not if they were deprived of water or sugar. Deprivation caused them to take prey juices from workers, they got more if the workers themselves have also been deprived. This is because such workers over-collect and readily pass on their surplus. Even well-fed larvae will take prey juices from these surfeited workers; they will also take sugary fluids but not water. The head of a larva elicited some food collection by workers even if it was immobile, but the real cause of food flow towards larvae was their ability to absorb and assimilate the prey juices which they obtained from workers. Starved nurse workers obtained prey and water from foragers but a reverse flow did not occur; only thin syrup was exchanged freely between workers.

The form of each display makes available information identifying its user. It addition, since each display correlates probabilistically with a consistent set of activities, it makes available information about the behavior in which the communicator is, or may become, engaged. At least 5 different kinds of behavior can be specified through the use of these displays.

TI SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR OF ANURAN AMPHIBIANS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Review
AB Temporal patterns of anuran reproduction fall into 2 broad categories: prolonged breeding and explosive breeding. The spatial and temporal distribution of females determines the form of male-male competition. Males of explosive breeders in dense aggregations engage in ''scramble competition'', attempting amplexus with every individual and struggling among themselves for possession of females. Males of prolonged breeders usually call from stationary positions to attract females and often maintain some sort of intermale spacing. Many aspects of vocal behavior and chorus organization can be viewed as consequences of intrasexual competition. Males of some prolonged breeders defend all-purpose territories, oviposition sites, or courtship areas against conspecific males. Males with high quality territories may enhance their attractiveness to females and obtain several mates in one season. The social organization of some species resembles the lek behavior of other vertebrates. Males or females of some tropical species care for eggs and tadpoles, but the evolution of parental care has not yet been studied in detail.

The 2 individuals'' were significantly discriminated in 8 of 11 different combinations of scent receiver and pair of scent donors. The 2 scent donors were always of the same sex and subspecies, and they could be discriminated by members of their own or of another sex or subspecies.

AB Observations on 3 naturally-occurring courtships of Hepialus [H. humili, H. hecta] show that sexual behavior in these moths is similar to that of butterflies, with the male pursuing the female in flight and mating with her after she alights. Although the female appears to solicit courtship by flying past a hovering male, and although the male becomes flaccid immediately after copulation, it is not true that the femal flies directly at the male and knocks him out of the air, as is widely held by moth-collectors.

TI PROBLEM DIVERSITY AND FAMILIARITY IN MULTIPLE DISCRIMINATION LEARNING BY
   MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rhesus monkeys given many discrimination problems daily form efficient learning sets. This experiment asks if diversity of problems is a necessity or even an aid in discrimination learning. It also investigates the importance of stimulus familiarity and, within familiar stimulus pairs, t he comparative efficiency of memory and learning in the formation of generalized learning sets. Three groups of 4 stumptailed macaques were trained in a learning set experiment. Two groups saw 7 familiar and 3 unfamiliar problems daily; the 3rd group saw 10 problems, all new. Reward was always under certain familiar stimuli for the PR [predictable reward] group but unpredictably located for the UR [unpredictable reward] group. Control group performances surpassed that of the familiar problem groups on novel problems. Familiar problem performance equalled the novel problem performance in the UR group. Proficiency on novel problems was identical for the two familiar problem groups.

AB [long dasg]A factor, contributed to distilled water by developing stages of Culex tarsalis, has been found to act as an oviposition stimulant for females of this species. The stimulant remains in the water after larvae, papae and pupal exuviae have been removed by filtration. There are some indications that the factor may be species specific. C. tarsalis females show a greater response to water which has contained their own species than to water which has contained developing stages of Culiseta inornata (Williston), Aedes aegypti (L.) or Culex pipiens (L.).

TI MECHANISMS OF NEONATE SUCKING BEHAVIOUR IN KITTTEN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sucking on an artificial nipple was found present at birth, by the age of 20 days it is absent from the kitten''s initial response. Repeated forced feeding experience results in the development of sucking up to 40 days of age, beyond which the kitten learns to chew on the nipple instead of sucking. There are 2 steps in the maturational improvement of the kittens'' ability of learning to suck from the bottle, the 2nd around 30 days of age, is parallel with the 1st emergence of mature EEG pattern and 1st response to solid food. Complete sucking deprivation and individual isolation render the kitten unable to initiate sucking on the mother if the deprivation lasts from birth to the 23rd day of age or more. Similar deprivation in group situation does not interfere with the kitten''s suckling on the mother. Surgical destruction of the olfactory bulbs renders the kitten unable to initiate sucking on the mother, but it does not interfere with the kittens'' ability of learningto suck from a bottle, nor does it interfere with the retention of such preoperative habit. The exercise of neonate reflex activities, mediated by subcortical mechanisms and olfaction, is essential for the development of persistent sucking on the mother.

TI ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION IN A LYCOSID SPIDER (LYCOSA RABIDA WALCKENAER)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The characteristics and significance of palpal drumming sounds produced by males during courtship and threat displays were studied in the wolf spider Lycosa rabida. During the intervals between courtship sounds, receptive females responded by performing a leg waving display. After such displays by the female, the interval between the male''s courtship sounds decreased. Responsiveness of females to palpless males indicated that the acoustic component of courtship display was not essential under daylight conditions. However, when visual stimulation was not possible, acoustic signals were sufficient to attract nearby females. In response to courtship or threat display sounds, males often performed threat displays. Playback experiments suggested that these spiders can hear air-borne sounds.

AB Intercorrelations of scores obtained during retrieving and nesting tests given to primiparous dams indicates that pup retrieving and care of retrieved pups in the nest site are relatively independent of one another and of nesting activities. These data suggest that the term maternal behavior does not represent a unitary behavioral process and that the use of 1 or 2 measures of maternal activity may be inadequate for assessing the effects of experimental manipulations on the maternal behavior of the rat.

TI EARLY EXPERIENCE AND SEXUAL OBJECT-CHOICE IN BROWN LEGHORN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To study the effect of early experience on the sexual behavior of domestic cocks, male chicks were reared in isolation from one another from the day of hatching, and their behavior compared with that of chicks reared communally for the first 20 days of life. Their sexual responses having been precociously induced by androgen injections, the 7-wk.-old cockerels were given each a simultaneous choice test, using a homospecific stimulus object and a human ons. After a further 3 days during which all birds lived communally, this test was repeated. Thereafter, all lived communally until they were 6 months old, when further observations were made on their sexual choice. In contrast to the socially experienced birds, naive ones showed little tendency to react to the homospecific stimulus, though the tendency increased markedly after only 3 days of communal living. Only birds reared in early isolation reacted sexually to the human stimulus, at 7 weeks, some showing a very marked bias for it. At 6 mo. none reacted sexually to a human stimulus object, but all reacted normally to hens, the birds in the 2 rearing groups being indistinguishable in this respect. The results suggest that early experience facilitates the later orientation of sexual behavior to the appropriate object. The significance of the relative impermanence of some of these effects is discussed.

TI MATING BEHAVIOUR OF 2 INBRED STRAINS OF MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations were made of the mating patterns of males from 2 inbred strains, ST/J and CBA/J, with females from both of these strains. Experiment I involved 10 single males, housed separately, while Experiment II involved 10 inter-strain pairs of males, housed together. Under most conditions, the ST males had a significantly greater rate of mating success than the CBA males. Under all conditions, the mating pattern of the ST male was significantly different from that of the CBA male in at least 2 respects (thrusts per mount and genital lickings per mating). It is not possible, at this time, to attribute the greater mating success of the ST male to any specific aspects of his mating pattern. The mating success of each of the 2 types of males, under paired conditions with ST females, in this experiment corresponds closely to the reproductive success of these males in a previous experiment.

TI AGGRESSIVE MOTIVATION IN RAT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A group of rats that consistently killed mice but did not kill rat pups and a control group of rats that killed neither mice nor rat pups were trained in a T-maze where one goal box contained a mouse and the other a rat pup. The rats that killed mice learned to enter the arm of the maze that led to a mouse, whereas the rats that did not kill mice displayed a preference for the rat pup. Thus it was shown that the opportunity to kill is a sufficient incentive to support and maintain discrimination learning by rats that kill mice, whereas for rats that do not kill mice contact with a mouse is less rewarding than is contact with a rat pup.

AB Locusta was able to detect the presence of inorganic salts, hydrochloric acid and quinine hydrochloride in the medium provided for oviposition, and if the concentration was high enough would reject it for oviposition. In choice experiments between NaCl and distilled water, increase in the concentration of NaCl above 0.05[image] resulted in an increase in the number of unsuccessful diggings and a decrease in the number of eggs deposited in the NaCl. Both of these parameters were logarithmically related to increase in the molar concentration of the NaCl. The females had 2 thresholds of response towards the molar concentration of NaCl. There was an initial threshold, which was the concentration at which the salt was 1st detected, but at which laying still occurred, and a rejection threshold in which oviposition never occurred. Sucrose elicited an acceptance response, and females laid in NaCl solutions which they would otherwise have rejected if a high enough concentration of sucrose was added to the NaCl. 1st. The stimulating efficiency of cations was found to be Na+ =R+ < m++ <Mg++ and this corresponds to the lyotropic series for cations. The stimulating efficiency of anions was found to be: Ac-<Cl-=NOo<1SO"4 6 2 which corresponds to their ionic mobilities. Local stimulation experiments, cautery and electrophysiological studies all gave negative results in a search for possible chemoreceptor sites in the ovipositor region.

AB Rats were either handled or not disturbed in infancy. When weaned at 25 days, they were placed into laboratory cages with same-sexed litter-mates, free-environment boxes with other litter-mates of the same sex or free-environment boxes with litter-mates of both sexes. At 50 days all Ss were placed into laboratory cages with others of the same sex and litter. Open-field activity and defecation scores were obtained between 70 and 73 days of age. The activity measure revealed that handling in infancy and free-environment experience after weaning both resulted in significantly heightened activity scores. In addition, females were significantly more active than males and defecated significantly less. There was no evidence that the pressence or absence of social interaction between the sexes affected emotionality.

LA English
DT Article
AB The behavioural response of the feral pigeon to acid solutions was studied by preference tests. In contrast with the bitter and sweet modalities, the results suggest that the physiological receptor mechanism in birds for sour stimuli is similar to that of mammals. Inorganic acids and bases produce a similar pattern of rejection whereas, at equal pH, the stimulative efficiency of organic acids parallels their lipoid solubility and surface activity. Saliva is probably of little importance as a buffering agent. Addition of sweetening agents to the acid solutions did not increase their acceptability. It is suggested that many birds which appear to be "tasteblind" are probably normal in their chemosensory mechanisms.

AB Widespread existence of consistent differences in behaviour among individuals even within species and populations (i.e. animal personality) has been established over recent decades in a wide array of taxa. However, little is known about personality traits' ontogeny and evolution. In this study we aimed to explore ecoevolutionary mechanisms driving the emergence and development of animal personality. Focusing on boldness as a personality trait, we assessed how personality components (mean, among- and within-individual variabilities, repeatability and plasticity in response to environmental complexity) develop at early age. Investigating development of all personality components, rather than averages only, offers a more exhaustive and comprehensive picture of how personality emerges, develops and evolves. We compared personality components between juveniles of five morphs of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, ranging along gradients of ecological and genetic divergence from a common ancestor, raised from hatching in plain versus structurally complex treatments. On the one hand, our results showed that some of these personality components evolve and develop independently from the others: mean boldness, which increases with divergence from the ancestor, was predominantly genotype dependent and suspectedly a highly heritable trait with strong and stable selective pressures acting on it in the wild, while boldness repeatability might rather depend on the ecology of each morph. These two components were not affected by environmental complexity. On the other hand, variability-related components of personality, including their plasticity in response to environmental complexity, were rather dependent on genotype-by-environment effects and seemingly evolve and develop jointly. Boldness tended to be more consistent within the treatment mimicking the structural complexity of a given morph's natural habitat, hinting that personality emergence might be favoured for individuals experiencing conditions to which they have been adapted. These findings suggest mechanisms by which personality components could be implicated in adaptability to environmental changes or even sympatric diversification and biodiversity.<br /> (c) 2025 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Ectoparasites are known to induce behavioural changes in their hosts, yet their downstream effects on other ecological interactions are less well understood. We examined the influence of ectoparasites on a key process in forest ecosystems: seed dispersal by their granivorous hosts. In a controlled field experiment, we manipulated ectoparasite loads on wild yellow-necked mice, Apodemus flavicollis, and monitored changes in various aspects of acorn, Quercus robur, dispersal: removal, recovery, consumption, caching and dispersal distance. Contrary to the hypothesis that ectoparasite-infested mice would change seed-handling behaviours due to increased foraging costs, our results demonstrated minimal impacts of ectoparasites on these behaviours. Initially, we observed marginally lower removal rates of acorns and shorter dispersal distances in the ectoparasite-reduced populations, which later aligned with the control groups. No significant differences were found in the probability of acorn recovery, modes of consumption or caching behaviours between the control and treated groups. Thus, the anticipated parasite-induced trophic cascade did not occur. These patterns suggest that yellow-necked mice exhibit behavioural tolerance of infestation, and their ecological role as seed dispersers remains unchanged despite ectoparasite infestation. Our findings challenge the assumptions regarding the severity of ectoparasitic impacts on host foraging behaviour.<br /> (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Every year in Newfoundland, young Atlantic puffins, Fratercula arctica, departing their nests at night for the first time become stranded in towns near their breeding colonies, a phenomenon thought to be caused by attraction towards artificial light. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among high-pressure sodium (HPS), Warm white light-emitting diode (LED), Cool white LED, Blue LED and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation and husbandry programmes. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic puffin strandings is the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine whether aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.

AB Space use is widely assumed to be an important predictor of social behaviour given that animals are most likely to interact with nearby conspecifics. In the age of remote-sensing technology, spatial proximity is often used as a proxy for social interaction, although this simplifying assumption has rarely been tested under field conditions. Using 5 years of spatial and social data from direct observations of nearly 200 individually marked free-living California ground squirrels, Otospermophilus beecheyi, we employed social network statistics to evaluate the role of spatial relationships in generating individual differences in sociality. As predicted, range size was positively associated with each of the four social network metrics examined, confirming that more social squirrels generally had larger ranges. The proportion of range overlap between individuals was positively correlated with the strength of their social interactions, with the strongest ties occurring within age and sex classes and with juveniles generally being more social than adults. To determine whether these outcomes varied with interaction type, we examined the effects of spatial relationships on affiliative interactions, agonistic interactions and all interactions combined. We found that spatial relationships better predicted affiliative encounters compared to agonistic encounters. Despite revealing significant links between spatial and social relationships, our models explained only a small proportion of the variation in each social network metric examined. Thus, factors other than space use must contribute to social interactions, suggesting that general assumptions regarding the effects of space use on social interactions need to be evaluated on a species-by-species basis. More generally, these findings highlight the need for explicit consideration of the spatiosocial interface and its implications for multiple aspects of animal behaviour.

However, it can be challenging to understand the specific role of certain signals and how they might have evolved into complex communication systems. To investigate what effect a lack of acoustic communication can have on brood care and offspring performance, we silenced parents of biparentally caring burying beetles with a noninvasive method and studied the effect on clutch and offspring performance. Moreover, by analysing three species with varying degrees of offspring dependency on parental care, we aimed to investigate how differing acoustic communication is related to the level of their dependency and if those two align in some way. We used Nicrophorus pustulatus, a nondependent species, Nicrophorus orbicollis, a highly dependent species and Nicrophorus vespilloides, an intermediately dependent species. We found strong effects of silencing parents on offspring performance in all three species. The lack of stridulations impacted offspring weight across all three species. However, our results point towards a difference between species in which development stage communication had the most substantial impact. Looking at larval weight at dispersal, the effects seem to be in line with the larval dependency in the way we would have expected, with N. orbicollis being the most strongly affected, N. vespilloides being also affected and N. pustulatus not being affected. However, looking more closely, we found various differences at other time points and also that larval survival was strongly affected in N. pustulatus. Few studies have looked at the exact function of acoustic signals during brood care with most of them focusing on what type of different signals are emitted rather than what effect they have. Our study is one of the first to start disentangling the interplay of communication and offspring performance.

AB Recent research on bird calls has unearthed a striking result: birds sometimes react to the calls of other species that are neither geographically nor phylogenetically close. One mechanism explaining this response may be the recognition of specific acoustic features, also present in their own vocalizations, rather than the recognition of complete notes, with the result that unfamiliar calls may be understood if they contain the critical feature. Parids and other passerines produce mobbing calls with similar properties that are responded to across species (i.e. noisy, large frequency range notes reaching low frequencies and with numerous harmonics) that are therefore good candidates for recognition based on features. In a playback experiment, we explored the featural interpretation hypothesis by testing the response of free-ranging great tits, Parus major, to artificial mobbing calls with varying acoustic properties. We first confirmed that they respond to artificial calls sharing all the targeted spectral properties (large frequency range, low frequency, noise and harmonics). In contrast, great tits did not respond to calls with the same rhythmicity but without the targeted features. We then tested whether great tits respond to calls that possess only one of the four above-mentioned properties. We show that great tits did not respond to any of the four treatments, and therefore no single specific spectral feature seems likely to explain great tits' response to unknown calls. We discuss alternative mechanisms for decoding novel calls, notably through a similarity threshold. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Behavioural lateralization is widespread across animal taxa. Consistent with the idea that lateralization indicates advantageous specialization of the brain hemispheres, individuals with more lateralized behaviour are often found to have better cognition. Among-individual differences in behavioural lateralization nevertheless exist, sometimes associated with differences in other phenotypic traits. Knowing which phenotypes are associated with behavioural lateralization gives cues as to why differences in lateralization exist within populations, but past research has often focused on one or a few phenotypes, and found different, sometimes opposed, correlations with lateralization. Here, we assayed behavioural lateralization of common waxbills, Estrilda astrild, in a feeding task, to test for associations with phenotypic differences, using a broad set of traits that might influence or be influenced by lateralization: a cognitive trait (inhibitory control), size, personality, social dominance, cues of stress and sex. Most individuals consistently fed with the right side towards the food, resulting in a population level right- side lateralization. However, evaluating photographs from waxbills feeding in the wild worldwide, we found no evidence of a preferred feeding side, contrasting with results in our population. There were also differences between individuals in our population in the direction and strength of lateralization. Females were, on average, more right-side lateralized than males, and there were larger among-individual differences in lateralization among males. None of the phenotypes studied predicted differences in the strength of lateralization. However, individual differences in the direction of lateralization were related to inhibitory control, an aspect of cognition, more strongly so in males than in females. These are among the few results indicating that the direction of behavioural lateralization, rather than its strength, is associated with cognitive differences among individuals. It is also the first time that a sex-dependent association between behavioural lateralization and cognitive performance has been found, suggesting that sex-specific functions are implicated in maintaining differences in behavioural lateralization.

AB Affiliative relationships are well documented in a wide range of wild animals. However, there is limited evidence of their existence in social farm animals, despite potential significant animal welfare implications. We aimed to determine whether pigs have preferential partners for affiliative interactions and associations and whether these preferences remain stable over time or are influenced by sex, dominance rank or litter of origin (i.e. kinship or familiarity). Two pens of 12 domestic pigs, Sus scrofa, two males and two females from three litters, were weaned at 28 days of age and observed from 42 to 57 days (postweaning phase) and from 70 to 85 days (finishing phase) following a change of housing at 62 days. Sociopositive behaviours, including nose-to-nose and nose-to-body contacts, allogrooming and associations while lying were scored on video observations over 6 days per phase. Using social network analysis methods, we found nonrandom social preferences for allogrooming in both pens of pigs, which remained stable between the postweaning and finishing phases. We also observed nonrandom associations for proximities while lying, although these patterns were not found in both pens of pigs and did not systematically persist between phases. In contrast, nose-to-nose interactions were expressed randomly in both pens and phases. Depending on the housing conditions, social preferences for grooming interactions or proximity while lying were only weakly influenced by sex, dominance rank or litter of origin. We did not find any correlation between social networks for grooming interactions and associations while lying. In summary, our study highlights the existence of durable affiliative relationships based on grooming interactions and proximity while lying within stable pig groups. These relationships appear to be minimally affected by sex, dominance, kinship or familiarity. Taking these relationships into account, particularly from a young age, could be pivotal in improving the welfare of pigs on farms. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Noise from oil and gas development is pervasive across many landscapes and creates a novel soundscape that wildlife must adapt to or avoid. In response to anthropogenic noise, many wildlife species alter their vocalizations. Some adjusted vocalizations may promote effective communication in the presence of noise by improving detection and preserving information about the sender's status. However, if adjusted vocalizations fail to improve communication in noise, both missed detections and misinterpretations of vocalizations could impact the fitness of individuals and ultimately contribute to population declines. Baird's sparrow is a species at risk in Canada that adjusts its songs in response to oil well drilling noise by altering whole-song elements such as decreasing the peak frequency of songs (Curry et al., 2017, Bioacoustics, 27(2), 105-130). We examined the efficacy of these adjusted songs in the mixed-grass prairies of southern Alberta, Canada during the Baird's sparrow breeding season (May-July 2018 and 2019) using a repeated measures study design (N = 69 dyads) in which we simulated territorial intrusions by broadcasting adjusted songs and unadjusted songs in the presence and absence of oil well drilling noise recordings. We found that focal male behaviour was mainly mediated by noise treatment when compared to song treatment. In noisy trials, males sang less, called more and performed more flybys, regardless of song treatment type. However, in noisy trials, males displayed longer song latency in response to unadjusted songs compared to adjusted songs. The results of our novel study suggest that the presence of oil well drilling noise elicits more aggressive territorial defence behaviour in Baird's sparrows or hinders the ability of individuals to locate or assess rivals. Additionally, our results suggest that adjusted songs only partially restore effective communication in noise.

AB Predator-prey interactions are influenced by the ability of the parties to visually perceive each other. Changes in moonlight across the lunar cycle may influence visibility of predator and prey and how they interact with each other and access shared resources (e.g. water sources in the desert). We tested three competing hypotheses explaining the nocturnal activity of mammalian predator and prey at desert water sources (i.e. predation risk allocation hypothesis, visual acuity hypothesis, physiological need for water hypothesis). We used camera traps at water sources in the Great Basin Desert to monitor mammalian predators (bobcat, Lynx rufus; coyote, Canis latrans) and their shared prey (black-tailed jackrabbit, Lepus californicus; mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus; pronghorn, Antilocapra americana). We used generalized linear mixed-effects models and model selection to evaluate the influence of moonlight on the nocturnal activity of predator and prey after accounting for other influential abiotic and biotic factors. Responses to moonlight varied across species, with the activity of black-tailed jackrabbits and pronghorn being lunarphilic, the activity of coyotes being lunarphobic and the activity of bobcats and mule deer not associated with changes in moonlight. Our findings provide partial support for the visual acuity hypothesis and the physiological need for water hypothesis but do not support the predation risk allocation hypothesis in a desert predator-prey community.

AB Infanticide is a significant evolutionary force influencing carnivore behaviours, as it is one of the primary contributors to offspring mortality. Female multimale mating, which creates paternal uncertainty, is known to reduce infanticide. We propose that two crucial steps are needed for this strategy to work in solitary species like brown bears, Ursus arctos. First, after mating, females should choose dens within their mating area (step 1), boosting the chances of encountering potential fathers of cub(s) after den emergence in spring. However, the efficacy of this strategy hinges on males' fidelity to the same mating areas from one year to the next (step 2). Our study confirmed that pregnant females consistently selected dens within their mating areas, with significant overlap (around 90%) between areas used by females with cubs and their mating zones. Males also demonstrated fidelity (over 65%) to mating areas over 2 consecutive years. Infanticide significantly shapes the sociospatial ecology of female brown bears, a phenomenon that can carry nutritional costs for females with cubs, and influence settlement patterns near human shields to increase reproductive success. Additionally, in hunted populations, removing resident males can trigger an influx of potentially infanticidal bears from elsewhere. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation can negatively affect habitat quality within remnant habitat fragments, in terms of resource quality, abundance and spatiotemporal distribution. Variation in habitat quality across fragments may have subsequent differential effects on the behavioural ecology of animals in different locations in the landscape. However, the collection of long-term behavioural data across multiple locations is challenging. Here, I applied a broad, novel approach, using redundancy analyses to capture populationwide variation in behavioural responses to varying fragment habitat quality in the endangered black howler monkey, Alouatta pigra. I examined time budgets and group movements of 55 groups occupying 28 forest fragments around Palenque National Park, Mexico, in response to variation in fragment size, forest composition and isolation, and tested the alternative hypotheses that, in lowerquality habitats, black howlers adopt either (1) an energy-minimizing strategy, whereby they spend less time feeding and/or travelling and more time resting, or (2) an energy-maximizing strategy, whereby they spend more time feeding and/or travelling and less time resting. My results show that fragment habitat variables explained at least a third of the variation in time budgets and group movements and supported both alternative hypotheses: in lower-quality habitat in terms of fragment shape, tree size and forest composition, they rested more and fed less; in fragments with a lower Simpson's evenness index and less forest cover around the fragment, they moved more. As time budgets and group movements affect individual fitness by shaping energy intake and nutrition, my results are informative regarding potentially variable black howler population persistence in fragments of differing quality, which can be useful for conservation planning. Redundancy analyses may be useful in additional contexts where responses to habitat alteration across fragmented populations and landscapes are of interest, but long-term data collection presents logistical and scientific challenges.

AB The combinations of trait values that occur within individual animals are often constrained, forming syndromes. The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) theory proposes that physiological, behavioural and life history traits covary in a predictable way, with metabolic rate acting as the underlying driver of phenotypic variation along a 'slow-fast' axis. However, in many taxa, support for the association among traits predicted by POLS is either weak or absent. Interindividual variation in thermal sensitivities across traits might explain the lack of support for POLS. Indeed, several studies have found that populations contain 'thermal types', with traits falling along a cold-hot continuum, a pattern termed the thermal -behavioural syndrome. Here, we examine the role of temperature in mediating the covariation between physiology, locomotor performance and behaviour in an African lizard, the southern rock agama, Agama atra. First, we tested whether individuals vary in suites of behavioural traits (i.e. have behavioural types) and whether these differences persist across temperature. We then explored the relationship between behavioural type and thermal physiology. Lastly, we tested the fundamental prediction of POLS, whether resting metabolic rate underlies variation in behavioural types and thermal performance. We uncovered the presence of behavioural types in rock agamas, and behaviour was predicted by lizard thermal type. However, the direction of the association between these traits was mediated by body size. In large individuals, 'hot' and fast lizards were bold, whereas in smaller individuals, hot and fast lizards were shy. Despite theoretical predictions, resting metabolic rate did not drive variation in behavioural type in these lizards but did predict thermal type (i.e. thermal optimum). A general theory of pace of life will likely have to consider relationships between thermal physiology, body size and behaviour independently of the role of resting metabolism.

AB Individual patterns of scent marking can aid our understanding of the function of animal latrines. African wild dogs are pack-living social carnivores that regularly visit latrines, called shared marking sites, used by multiple neighbouring packs. Here we analysed scent marking by individual African wild dogs video captured at continuously monitored marking sites. Scent marking differed by sex and dominance status depending on social context (interpack versus intrapack exchanges). Dominants marked more frequently than subdominants, and patterns, particularly the order of overmarking, differed between the sexes. Dominant females were more likely than dominant males to overmark when the previous scent mark had been left by an individual from a different pack. Dominant males were more likely to leave the final, or top mark, regardless of social context or origin. Results are consistent with a resource defence advertisement function for wild dog latrines. However, sex-specific scent marking suggests the resource defended may differ between dominant females, which are more attentive to interpack scent marks, and dominant males, which are focused on overmarking a mate. The pattern of dominant male scent marking indicates that unambiguous advertisement of a bonded reproductive pair may be a critical component of communicating with neighbours about pack residence and territoriality.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Little is understood about how social cetaceans make collective decisions. Consensus processes are often beneficial for fitness at both a group and individual level, but most previous studies of decision making in whales and dolphins show evidence of a leader, frequently an individual with greater ecological knowledge or social connectedness. We used drone footage of long-finned pilot whales, Globicephala melas, off Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, to examine the characteristics of initial divers (age class/sex, relative position, accompanying calf) and the timing of when individuals dive (i.e. dive lag) within collective group dives (N 1/4 73). Resting groups of pilot whales had three-fold higher mean dive lag and interindividual dive intervals than groups in other behavioural states. Females initiated dives more often than expected by chance and initial divers were most frequently located peripherally on the left or right flank of the group. Dive lags following the initial diver had a heavily right-skewed distribution, suggesting that long-finned pilot whales within groups are often responding to a stimulus (e.g. physical leadership, a vocal signal, an approaching vessel). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that unequally distributed leadership guides the temporal patterning of the collective deep dives of pilot whales.

AB Most studies of vertebrate breeding success have been unable to pinpoint the cause for a simple and almost universal pattern: its steady increase during an animal's lifetime. Yet potential causes of increased breeding success have profound implications for the evolution of reproductive behaviour. An age-related increase might come about through (1) higher breeding investment by older animals, (2) breeding improvement through learning, (3) better reproductive coordination between familiar mates or (4) accumulated benefits of site familiarity. We used mixed models to investigate age-related predictors of hatching and fledging success in a population of common loons, Gavia immer, that contained many known-age breeders and has been under continuous study for 30 years. Hatching success of breeding pairs increased between the female's first and second years on territory but did not increase with further female experience. In contrast, pair hatching success increased in proportion to the cube root of the males' residency on a territory, a pattern that persisted beyond 15 years. Hatching date was earlier for pairs that had spent at least 1 year together and in which the female was young but had spent at least one prior year on the territory. Fledging rate of hatched young was greater among pairs that nested early but decreased with female age, an apparent indication of female reproductive senescence. Overall, breeding pairs fledged more young when the breeding male had many years of experience on the territory and the breeding female had been on territory for at least 1 year and was of moderate age. Our findings highlight the persistent influence of both site familiarity and chronological age on reproductive fitness. (c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Temperature and relative humidity are important environmental factors that greatly affect sound-mediated activities in animals. However, little is known about how changes in temperature and hu-midity affect animal vocal systems. Echolocating bats perceive their surroundings through acoustic signals. In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature and humidity changes on the audiovocal control system, Doppler shift compensation (DSC), in echolocating bats, Hipposideros armiger. Results revealed that the DSC system was more precise under higher temperature and humidity conditions, while the frequency of calls and echoes decreased under higher temperatures. Atmospheric attenuation and body temperature increased with increasing experimental temperature and humidity conditions. Our results suggest that atmospheric attenuation and body temperature significantly affect DSC precision (DSCP) and the specialized narrow-frequency band of the auditory system (reference frequency). Owing to the small differences in sound attenuation between experimental groups, we speculate that the changes in attenuation were not sufficient to induce changes in DSCP. We propose that DSC performance may change concomitantly with frequency adjustment and may be passively affected by body temper -ature regulation. Our study shows how changes in the weather can affect animal vocal control systems and fitness.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Temperature is a major driver of species interactions as it determines many physiological and behavioural parameters of ectothermic organisms such as insects. Examining the effects of elevated temperature and extreme temperature events within and between different trophic levels is crucial for understanding their broader implications for community and ecosystem level processes. We compared parasitism success of two hymenopteran parasitoid species, Diadegma semiclausum and Cotesia vestalis, under different temperature regimes when foraging intra- and interspecifically. Both parasitoid species can be found in the same habitat and are important biological control agents of the cosmopolitan lepidopteran pest Plutella xylostella, the host species in this study. Because parasitoid density may influence parasitism success through interference competition, we first investigated the effect of parasitoid density (one to four females of the same species) on parasitism success at 22 & DEG;C. In all assays, parasitoid females were released in cages with a single plant infested with 30 hosts placed in a greenhouse or climate cabinets set at 22, 27 or 33 & DEG;C and removed after 3 h. All cages were returned to 22 & DEG;C until pupation of the parasitoids or hosts, which were then counted. When females of the same species foraged together, parasitism success increased with parasitoid density. However, when both species were foraging together, parasitism success of D. semiclausum decreased with increasing temperature at both tested densities, whereas the opposite was found for C. vestalis. Nevertheless, parasitism success of D. semiclausum was always higher than that of C. vestalis, irrespective of parasitoid density or temperature, but competitive superiority of D. semiclausum decreased with increasing temperature. Increases in the magnitude and frequency of extreme temperature events under climate change are likely to have differential effects on species involved in intimate interactions, depending on community species composition, as species may differ in thermal resilience. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB I examined sex allocation of offspring in northern flickers, Colaptes auratus, a woodpecker with bipa-rental care and sexual size dimorphism. The analysis of data involving 8321 nestlings that were sexed over a span of 16 years revealed no significant bias towards the smaller sex (females) at the population level (all fledglings pooled), counter to the Fisherian hypothesis of equal investment at the end of parental care. At the level of the brood, high-quality parents (older and in better body condition) did not produce more of the expensive sex (males) counter to the Trivers-Willard hypothesis. Brood sex ratios were somewhat repeatable among females but did not vary significantly with year, clutch size or hatching date probably because the main food of flickers, ground-dwelling ants, is relatively invariable. Mother flickers allocated more of the cheaper sex to last-hatched offspring in asynchronous broods, consistent with the 'intrabrood sharing-out hypothesis' but not the 'competitive advantage hypothesis'. The female-bias in last-laid eggs was present in complete broods, which had no nestling mortality, suggesting that primary sex ratio manipulation was involved. However, a small shift in the direction of female-bias occurred as a result of a greater mortality of the more costly (male) nestlings. Female flickers may therefore attempt to minimize maladaptive brood reduction by allocating more of the cheaper sex to positions later in the laying sequence.Crown Copyright (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Females are predicted to adjust their reproductive investment to optimize the trade-off between current and future reproduction. In many cooperatively breeding birds, females have been shown to reduce their investment both pre- and posthatching in response to the presence of food-provisioning helpers. However, in species where not all group members help during the posthatching stage, it is currently unclear to which social cues (i.e. group size versus number of helpers) females should tune their investment. Here, we used the cooperatively breeding placid greenbul, Phyllastrephus placidus, as a model species to examine whether and how group size and number of helpers affect female investment in eggs and food provisioning. We found that females used a contrasting strategy pre- and posthatching in response to different social cues: they laid larger eggs in larger groups while reducing their feeding rate when assisted by more helpers. We also found that fledging success increased with group size and that nestlings raised in groups with helpers fledged with longer wings but found no relation between condition of the young and number of helpers. Since the perceived contrasting investment strategies may have several underlying causes, we conclude that predicting the influence of social conditions on maternal investment may be more challenging than previously believed.

AB The patterning of interactions between individuals over time form the foundation for relationships, which are the basis for social group structure. The emergent social structure scaling from interactions might, therefore, be influenced by individual differences in how individuals respond to stressors and uncertainty, which are often intrinsic aspects of social dynamics. During a 17-month study of wild olive baboons, Papio anubis, in Laikipia, Kenya, we measured individual differences in coping style and stress reactivity by experimentally presenting a stressor with multiple solutions. We measured individual differences in sociality through focal animal and ad libitum sampling that recorded grooming, aggres-sion, proximity, and social displacements. We examined whether experimental measures of coping style and stress reactivity (1) are linked to social network assortativity, (2) predict network position and (3) covary with social dominance rank. Homophily was observed for coping styles in a strong proximity network but not when weak associations were included in the analysis. Coping style scores did not predict social network strength or degree. Partner stability indices of proximity associations and social dominance rank did not covary with coping style measures. Static summative network structures may obfuscate investigative inquiries into the role of individual differences and, also, social structure may constrain or facilitate the behavioural expression of such differences. Thus, we should prioritize more fine-grain investigative approaches inclusive of variation in situation, context and consistency of group structure.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although not without controversy, the cognitive map in mammals and birds (avian reptiles) is generally accepted as plausible. The evidence for similar cognitive abilities is not generally accepted in other vertebrates and invertebrates. A plethora of recent work in nonavian reptiles, however, suggests that these taxa may indeed possess advanced cognitive processing and so may, in principle, be capable of using a cognitive map. To consider the possibility that a nonavian reptile might use a cognitive map, we reexamined the movement of the semiaquatic turtle (Chrysemys picta) in our highly accessible system where turtles follow highly conserved, precise and predictable migratory routes. We determined the movement rate and tortuosity of freely migrating turtles before, during and after a pharmacological manipulation that disrupted their ability to retrieve and create spatial memories. We found that turtles moved linearly on traditional routes prior to treatment. After pharmacological treatment, turtle move-ments became highly tortuous as they moved in some cases hundreds of metres away from their migratory routes. Once turtles recovered their spatial cognitive abilities, they returned directly to their migratory paths using linear movements suggestive of deliberate and purposeful navigation. Although other processes could potentially explain observed turtle movement patterns, we were able to exclude them by new or previous data, or strong inference. What remains is a robust behavioural observation that is consistent with the use of a cognitive map by turtles in our system. As such, we urge researchers to continue to be open to the possibility of cognitive maps in nonmodel taxa, such as nonavian reptiles, to continue to expand our understanding of the evolution of cognition.

AB Individuals respond adaptively to their environment. Yet, they may differ in their responses even when confronted with the same environmental challenge. Several complementary conceptual frameworks suggest that within populations among-individual variation in life history strategies aligns not only with individuals' propensities to take risks across different situations but also with their sensitivity to variation in environmental cues. Risk-prone individuals, suggested to invest more in current reproduction at the cost of their future reproductive prospects, are predicted to be less sensitive to environmental variation than risk-averse individuals. We tested this prediction in a population of breeding blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, by confronting them with different levels of predation threat at their nests and recording their latency to resume brood provisioning after the removal of the predator stimulus. We presented taxidermic woodpecker, Dendrocopos major (a common brood predator) and sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus (a common adult predator) mounts at each nest, respectively representing low and high levels of threat to adult blue tits. As a nonpredator control stimulus, we presented a blackbird, Turdus merula, mount. We found that on average parents took longer to resume provisioning after presentation of a sparrowhawk than a woodpecker or blackbird. Furthermore, individual latency responses across all threat levels taken together were repeatable. However, despite the population level plastic adjustment to the level of predation threat, we found no evidence for among-individual variation in plasticity. Instead, individual differences in responses were roughly maintained across all levels of threat. While our findings show that individuals differ in their level of risk taking, in the high-stakes and ecologically relevant context of predation risk during parental care, commonly held expectations about amongindividual variation in behavioural plasticity were not met.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Within populations, individuals exhibit repeatable differences in behaviour, known as animal personality. These among-individual differences in behaviour can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. One potential consequence of animal personality is (re-)capture bias, where individuals with certain behavioural types have a greater probability of being captured and/or recaptured for study. Assessing potential personality-related (re-)capture bias is important, as it can lead to biased population level inferences. Using a sample of previously captured black-capped chickadees, we explored whether individual recapture probability is affected by sex and five behavioural traits that show repeatable among-individual variation (i.e. animal personality). We found no evidence that recapture probability varied as a function of exploration, handling aggression or sampling behaviour. However, we found some support for an effect of sex, with males being less likely to be recaptured compared to females. Furthermore, there was moderate support for an effect of both feeding rate and latency to resume feeding after manipulation of perceived predation risk. Consistent with findings from a range of taxa, we found that individuals with higher baseline feeding rates and individuals with shorter latencies to resume feeding had a greater tendency to be recaptured. This may indicate that individuals with higher energetic needs, demonstrated by greater foraging activity in both benign and high perceived predation risk contexts, have a greater likelihood of being recaptured in the vicinity of feeders. However, given the breadth of the confidence intervals around estimated effect sizes, this result should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, given that among-individual differences in energy requirements are ubiquitous and have been shown to covary with a range of traits, we suggest that recapture biases may be the norm rather than the exception and propose solutions to mitigate the extent of foraging-related recapture bias.

AB Comparative studies of acoustic communication in clades with diverse signal features provide a powerful framework for testing relationships between perception and behaviour. We measured auditory sensitivity in five species of estrildid songbirds with acoustically distinct songs and tested whether differences aligned with species differences in song frequency content. Species were chosen based on phylogeny and differences in song acoustics. Behavioural audiograms were obtained using operant training and testing. Adult audiograms were compared across species and between sexes within a species. Juvenile and adult audiograms were compared in one species. The audiograms of adults reared by their own species and those reared and tutored by another species were compared in one species. Results showed that audiograms were similar across species and similar to previous reports of songbird auditory sensitivity. Species differed in the highest frequency detected and the frequency of peak sensitivity. While hearing frequency range was not correlated with song frequency bandwidth, the frequency of peak sensitivity was highly corelated with the frequency of peak energy in song. Sensitivity did not differ based on sex, age or tutoring experience. Our findings suggest that adaptations in songbird auditory sensitivity are largely constrained by shared peripheral and central encoding mechanisms, with species-specific perception appearing only at peak sensitivity.

AB Collective learning, the improvement of behaviours through experience of collective actions, is an area of animal learning that has received little attention. We investigated how individual learning during col-lective actions could produce improvements in collective performance, and how collective decision-making processes, including leadership dynamics, could impact upon learning. We trained artificial neural networks, either solo or paired, at an orientation task, based upon collective navigation in ani -mals. In pairs, we implemented two rules of collective decision making: 'democratic' (weighted average of individual propositions) or 'despotic' (one individual's proposition, determined randomly with weighted probabilities in each trial). Decision-making weightings were varied between pairs, but fixed for a given pair, with asymmetric weightings generating 'leaders' and 'followers'. We found nearly all pairs improved their orientation, but more slowly than solo learners. Within pairs, leaders learnt more quickly than followers ('the passenger-driver effect'). In democratic pairs, collective performance improved through individuals learning to compensate for partner error. This emergent process was not observed in pairs with despotic decision making, in which individuals learnt similarly to solo learners. Our model helps to clarify the links between individual learning, collective decision making and col-lective performance, in the context of collective navigation, and collective behaviour, more generally.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Nest predation is a primary cause of reproductive failure in birds; thus, predators apply strong selective pressure on nesting behaviour, especially risk assessment behaviours during predator encounters at nests. Prey's risk assessments are not static; rather, dynamic risk assessment theory predicts that prey assess risk in real-time and update it according to changes in cues posed by the predator(s). We used drone videography to film nest-flushing behaviours of common eiders, Somateria mollissima, in response to foraging polar bears, Ursus maritimus, on East Bay Island (Nunavut, Canada). We assessed how cue use influenced flushing behaviour and nest fate in a path analysis using 200 observations of 193 eiders in 2017. Our most supported model found that more direct angles of visual gaze and travel angle by polar bears resulted in conspicuous nest flushes by eiders (0 =-0.236 +/- 0.059), whereas the presence of herring gulls, Larus argentatus, resulted in more discrete flushes of hens walking from their nests (0 =-0.181 +/- 0.059). Shorter flush initiation distances between eiders and approaching bears resulted in greater nest predation by polar bears (0 =-0.203 +/- 0.076). We found no support that an eider's visibility from the nest influenced any component of flushing behaviour. We suggest that during encounters with bears, eiders are capable of assessing risk and making appropriate behavioural decisions to reduce the chances of nest loss. However, as the colony experienced heavy predation by bears in 2017, behavioural responses alone appear to be insufficient to mitigate polar bear predation at the population level.

AB Animal communication, including the transmission of risk-related information, has long been recognized as occurring in a network, rather than being limited to signaller-receiver dyadic interactions. However, it is rare for studies on communication to explicitly incorporate a network approach and for network studies to focus on communication interactions and information transmission in nongrouping species. Consequently, the properties of communication networks and the extent to which risk-related infor-mation can spread through populations of territorial animals remain largely unexplored. Here, I exam-ined the structure and spatial extent of eavesdropping networks by studying alarm calls in wood warblers, Phylloscopus sibilatrix, small, territorial songbirds inhabiting temperate European forests. Using a playback experiment, I first established the active space of wood warblers' alarm signals, that is, how the strength of antipredator responses to conspecific alarm calls varies as a function of distance between signallers and receivers. Next, I combined social network analysis and fine-scale, long-term data on wood warblers' territory distribution to delineate spatially explicit alarm call eavesdropping networks and to explore the potential for risk-related information transmission at the population level. Response strength of wood warblers to conspecific calls decreased with increasing distance to callers, suggesting distance -dependent eavesdropping. However, each year the majority of individuals occupied territories within the active space of alarm signals of multiple neighbours and could reach information from even more of them via indirect links. Moreover, the patterns of connections between individuals were generally similar across years, suggesting that basic network properties remain stable over time. This study shows that during the spring breeding season, individual birds are interlinked with conspecifics across territory borders into population-wide information webs, in which risk-related information can readily spread across large spatial scales. In turn, this highlights the social environment as an important dimension of individuals' niches even in otherwise territorial animals.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Knowledge of the drivers of fine-scale spatial ecology in wide-ranging marine species is vital to un-derstand population structuring and conserve threatened species. Movements and habitat use are likely to be strongly influenced by social relationships between individuals, and social units within animal populations may be subject to distinct selective pressures. Here we used passive acoustic telemetry and network-based analyses to investigate the site visit patterns and social affiliations of reef manta rays, Mobula alfredi, in Raja Ampat, West Papua. Acoustic transmitters were externally deployed on 27 rays that were tracked for up to 110 days. Visit profiles were retrieved from nine acoustic receivers positioned in clusters at known aggregation sites, enabling analysis of movement behaviour and social processes at various spatial scales. We utilized Bayesian inference and a double permutation method to address issues in sampling and hypothesis testing on social networks constructed from automated telemetry data. We found that social affiliations were assorted into spatially defined communities which remained stable over several weeks to months, although many affiliations were short lived. Interindividual variability in detection profiles was correlated with social network metrics. Individuals with high levels of site attachment had stronger social affiliations, while individuals that regularly attended different receiver clusters were more central to the overall social network. These results suggest that reef manta ray movements, habitat preferences and social relationships should be understood as linked behavioural processes for which variability between individuals and groups may drive emergent population struc-ture. Future research and local management of manta rays will likely benefit from identifying how, where and why social gatherings occur.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Vocal recognition in social contexts is phylogenetically widespread and can be explained by kin and mate recognition or group coordination. It remains unclear why some species evolved alarm calls that also provide cues to signaller identity as the function of these calls is thought to predominantly serve predation avoidance. One hypothesis is that individually distinct alarms facilitate the detection of unreliable callers, which is in line with the idea of reputation-based mate choice. However, it remains unknown whether receivers use provided cues to identify the signaller and, if yes, how vocal signaller recognition impacts on their own behaviour during predation events. In many nonhuman primates, males provide risky antipredator services to the rest of the group while uttering conspicuous alarm calls. In putty-nosed monkeys, some male alarm types have been shown to be individually distinct and females have been shown to vocally recruit males for predation defence. Whether females are sensitive to the identity of the male supporting them in predation defence is unknown. We tested 16 groups of putty-nosed monkeys in the Nouabale Ndoki National Park (Republic of Congo) with different alarm types from different males. Specifically, we broadcast pyow, hack and kek calls from the group's own male, a neighbouring male and an unknown male, respectively, to each group. Female receivers were sensitive to signaller identity and consistently varied their own antipredator behaviour between different males for two call types but not for eagle-related hacks. We explored different possible explanations for male recognition based on risky male antipredator services and conclude that our results are strongly in line with the reputation-based mate choice hypothesis.

AB The presence of repeatable behaviours that vary between individuals (animal personality) and the mechanisms that underpin these behaviours are of significant ecological and evolutionary importance. With current climatic trends predicted to facilitate biological invasions, we sought to examine how personality and behavioural syndromes may influence invasion potential in the face of a changing climate. We assessed a population of an invasive crayfish, Cherax destructor, in a laboratory setting for (1) the presence of temporally and contextually repeatable behavioural differences between individuals along three axes: (i) activity, (ii) boldness/shyness and (iii) exploration/avoidance, (2) correlations between body size, sex and behavioural traits at the between-individual level, (3) the influence of predicted near-future increases in temperature on personality and (4) the presence of behavioural syndromes (between-individual correlations among behaviours). Individuals exhibited repeatable variation along the three behavioural axes, providing support for the presence of animal personality. Body size was negatively correlated with exploration and activity, but sex was unrelated to personality across the three axes. Exploration increased with temperature, whereas the effect of temperature on activity was dependent on the treatment order. Finally, activity and exploration were positively correlated, indicative of a behavioural syndrome. This study provides evidence of state-dependent personality and support for the existence of behavioural syndromes which may facilitate biological invasions. Our work also provides evidence to suggest that predicted future increases in temperature will promote exploratory behaviour in invasive populations of C. destructor.

AB Anthropogenic noise is increasing at an alarming rate in urban as well as rural ecosystems and detrimental effects have been reported on many animals relying on acoustic communication. Little is known regarding the impact of different types of noise on community level predator perception and breeding behaviour. Here, we presented a predator model alone or a predator combined with a specific noise type, such as traffic, a lawnmower or a chainsaw, to breeding pairs of great tits, Parus major, giving them the opportunity to perform mobbing behaviour that could provide public information to their neighbours. We then measured the provisioning behaviour of adjacent tit pairs, which were 50-150 m away from the focal pairs' nests. The adjacent breeding pairs decreased nest visits when focal birds were exposed to the sparrowhawk model or to the sparrowhawk model combined with the lawnmower noise. Neighbouring pairs did not reduce the rate of nest visits when focal birds were exposed to the hawk model combined with the traffic or the chainsaw noise. The distance from focal nests did not alter the noise effect on neighbouring pairs. We suggest that auditory masking is the most likely mechanism to explain why noise compromises public information. The chainsaw and traffic noise overlap with the frequency of mobbing calls and disrupt the transmission of auditory signals in the community. Further, when the hawk presentation was combined with the chainsaw noise, which was the type of noise that had the highest frequencies, the latency of mobbing by the focal birds was strongly increased, and the number of species involved in mobbing was reduced. This study demonstrates that the signalling function of mobbing is ineffective in noisy environments which ultimately impacts fitness via increased predation to adults or their offspring.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social relationships are critical components of health and fitness for humans and other animals. For female-philopatric species, affiliative relationships among females (kin and nonkin alike) can influence components of fitness that include individual survival, interbirth interval and offspring survival. Affiliative relationships with males have attracted somewhat less attention, with most studies focusing on femaleemale relationships as adaptations for infanticide avoidance. Here, we use 8 years of behavioural data on Kinda baboons, Papio kindae, to assess whether maternal social relationshipsdboth among females and between females and malesdaffect infant survival, interbirth interval and the pace of infant development. Kinda baboons are an ideal system for these analyses because males and females form strong relationships outside of the periovulatory period and in the absence of obvious infanticide threat. We calculated social metrics that reflected dominance status, total social integration and social bond strength and paired these metrics with data on offspring survival, interbirth interval (IBI) duration and infant behavioural maturation. Neither dominance rank nor sociality had a significant effect on interbirth interval or survival, but higher rank and the stronger affiliative relationships between a female and her top female and top male social partners predicted more rapid infant behavioural maturation. These results suggest that maternal dominance and sociality may confer advantages related to infant development and independence that ultimately may permit females to more quickly invest in subsequent offspring and point to advantages of relationships with males outside of lowering infanticide threat.

AB Recent research has established the importance of animal personality traits in behavioural ecology, encompassing domains such as mate choice, cognition and social interactions. However, less is known about how personality traits predict parental behaviour. In the current study, we investigate these relationships in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia gutatta, a species that provides biparental care and in which social feedback from parents shapes juvenile song learning. Adults were first assessed on exploratory tendency in a novel environment, then allowed to pair and rear cross-fostered young. Birds were housed in single-family cages within the colony, allowing for visual and auditory interaction between families. We examined foster parent-juvenile interactions over the course of song learning (35-65 days posthatch), recording parental responsiveness (responses contingent on juvenile songs) as these responses are known to influence song learning outcomes. Exploration scores predicted parental responsiveness in contrasting ways: low-exploring males provided more contingent responses to the immature song of juveniles, while high-exploring females increased their responsiveness to a greater degree over the course of juvenile song development. Over the period of offspring song development, females were more responsive to changes in juvenile vocal production, increasing the number of responses provided as juveniles increased their rate of singing. In contrast, males were less variable in their response rate across development; their contingent singing was not sensitive to changes in the rate of juvenile singing. The importance of exploration as a predictor of parental responsiveness to offspring behaviour demonstrates the possible significance of previous findings that adults pair based on the trait of exploration.

AB Ticks vector a greater variety of pathogens than any other arthropod group, making them a significant threat to the public, companion animals and wildlife. Surveying wildlife habitats and areas commonly used for recreation for the presence of ticks and the pathogens that they carry is essential to the prevention of tick-borne diseases. Tick behaviour also plays an active role in transmission dynamics. We set out to study the host-seeking behaviour of Amblyomma americanum, the lone star tick, at the population level and at the individual level by collecting ticks in public parks in Gainesville, Florida, U.S.A., and by conducting behavioural assays on host-seeking behaviour (questing). We assayed a subset of the collected ticks for 3 consecutive days to determine whether ticks displayed repeatable, individual level differences in questing behaviour. Afterward, we screened ticks for two human pathogens, Rickettsia spp. and Ehrlichia spp. While we did not find differences in pathogen prevalence among the populations, we found that nymphal ticks infected with Rickettsia amblyommatis spent less time questing than uninfected nymphs. However, across all populations, we found a greater prevalence of R. amblyommatis in adult ticks. Additionally, nymphs were more likely to engage in questing behaviours than adults. Lastly, we found significant repeatability in the average height that a tick quests and the questing likelihood of a tick. These findings could fill a gap in the knowledge about trends in disease dynamics.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For birds with altricial nestlings, behavioural flexibility in provisioning may be essential to success, as it enables parents to respond to changes in offspring demand. While parents often increase the quantity of food they provide as nestlings grow, they may also adjust different aspects of this suite of behaviours (i.e. feeding rate, prey type and size and distribution within broods) flexibly in response to nestling age. We tested whether generalist insectivores, mountain bluebirds, Sialia currucoides, respond to abrupt shifts in the body size of nestlings the same way they do when nestlings age normally. During a short-term (within-day) manipulation of nestling age, we recorded provisioning behaviour of parents feeding their own ('natal') and an age-manipulated (increased or decreased by 4 days) brood on the same day, in addition to recording provisioning ~4 days before or after, when natal broods were the same age as manipulated broods. Parents responded to the age manipulation by altering feeding rates, but when broods aged naturally, parents altered the types and sizes of prey they delivered. Parents fed less often and provided larger prey when feeding younger-than-expected broods than when feeding young natal broods. Parents given older-than-expected broods fed more larvae, and fed more often, but provided smaller prey than supplied to older natal broods. Parents feeding older natal broods distributed prey more equitably among nestlings than those feeding either experimental older broods or younger broods (both natural and experimental broods), but this was not due to biased feeding of nestlings according to their body weight. Females fed more often than males and increased the quantity of larvae they provided to younger-than-expected broods. We suggest that parent mountain bluebirds can perceive and respond to both rapid and gradual changes in offspring size, but they may use different cues to adjust feeding rate and prey use.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals that forage in groups may either search actively for food sources (producers, P) or monitor other members of the group in an attempt to consume resources that producers have encountered (scroungers, S). One factor that may influence the choice of foraging strategy is the finder's share, defined as the proportion of the resource consumed by the producer before the arrival of scroungers. Several models predict that when the finder's share is relatively small, the frequency of scrounging will be high because producing gives only a small benefit compared to playing scrounger. A model based on a linear operator learning rule confirmed this prediction and further predicted that individuals would change their foraging strategy gradually in response to environmental changes. We tested these predictions in an experiment involving three groups (N 1/4 18 individuals) of free-ranging black-tufted marmosets, Callithrix penicillata. We manipulated the finder's share at artificial feeding stations by controlling the distribution of food rewards (slices of banana) among baited platforms. We divided our field experiments into two conditions low finder's share (few food-rich patches) and high finder's share (many food-poor patches). Most (15/18) marmosets consumed more banana slices as scroungers in the low finder's share condition than in the high finder's share condition, as expected by the theory. However, individuals did not modify their frequency of use of the strategies in both conditions and did not show gradual learning as expected by the linear operator learning rule. We suggest that in social groups with high levels of tolerance and cooperation, such as those of marmosets, scrounging individuals can have higher foraging success without increasing their searching effort by sharing productive food patches with producers and other scroungers.

AB Familiarity between members of the same group is predicted to play a role in many biological processes. Familiarity can facilitate recognition, aggregation, communication, coordination and cooperation between group members. We tested a path of interrelated hypotheses on the effect of familiarity on survival, resource acquisition, predator avoidance and cooperation. We predicted that individuals with familiar members in their group would have a higher survival, acquire resources faster, avoid predators more easily and perform more cooperative actions. We used data from an online video game (Dead by Daylight) where small groups of four players (i.e. prey) must exploit resource patches while avoiding a predator. Prey can help fellow prey when the predator catches them (cooperation). Using a video game as a study system provided access to a large behavioural data set that would otherwise be difficult to obtain in nature. Using path analysis, we found evidence that coordinated resource acquisition and helping behaviours increased with the number of familiar individuals in the group. However, more cooperative actions increased their encounters with the predator and thus reduced their survival. When accounting for all indirect effects of familiarity on survival (through resource acquisition, cooperation and predator -prey encounters), familiarity had a small indirect net positive effect on survival.

AB Opposite-sex social relationships are important predictors of fitness in many animals, including several group-living mammals. Consequently, understanding sources of variance in the tendency to form opposite-sex relationships is important for understanding social evolution. Genetic contributions are of particular interest due to their importance in long-term evolutionary change, but little is known about genetic effects on male-female relationships in social mammals, especially outside of the mating context. Here, we investigate the effects of genetic ancestry on male-female affiliative behaviour in a hybrid zone between the yellow baboon, Papio cynocephalus, and the anubis baboon, Papio anubis, in a population in which male-female social bonds are known predictors of life span. We place our analysis within the context of other social and demographic predictors of affiliative behaviour in baboons. Genetic ancestry was the most consistent predictor of opposite-sex affiliative behaviour we observed, with the exception of strong effects of dominance rank. Our results show that increased anubis genetic ancestry is associated with a subtle, but significantly higher, probability of opposite-sex affiliative behaviour, in both males and females. Additionally, pairs of anubis-like males and anubis-like females were the most likely to socially affiliate, resulting in moderate assortativity in grooming and proximity behaviour as a function of genetic ancestry. Our findings indicate that opposite-sex affiliative behaviour partially diverged during baboon evolution to differentiate yellow and anubis baboons, despite overall similarities in their social structures and mating systems. Furthermore, they suggest that affiliative behaviour may simultaneously promote and constrain baboon admixture, through additive and assortative effects of ancestry, respectively.

AB Many animals communicate using complex signals composed of multiple components. In some, multiple distinct signal components are organized into stereotyped sequences. Few studies, however, have examined how such temporal structure might arise, or how this structural complexity relates to signal function. Male black widow spiders (Latrodectus hesperus) intermittently transition from a 'haphazard' production of three distinct vibratory signal components to a temporally structured multicomponent display during courtship. In this study, we examined the function of structured signalling during courtship in L. hesperus. More specifically, we examined whether structured signalling rates is predicted by male mass and whether structured signalling rates predict male mating success. Then, we experimentally tested the consequences of removing one of the signal components (abdominal tremulation) for male mating success. Larger males had lower signalling rates, suggesting a trade-off between structured signalling and mass. Males that produced structured signals more frequently mated sooner. Impairment of abdominal tremulation did not affect copulation success, but these 'muted' males took significantly longer to mate. Our study demonstrates that the temporal arrangement of signal components is important for male mating success in L. hesperus. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sexual conflict over parental investment is widespread among species with biparental care. Studies have indicated that a high degree of behavioural similarity between the two parents can increase offspring survival; however, it remains unclear how sexual conflict over parental care is resolved. In this study, we examined whether similarity of personality traits between the two parents plays an important role in affecting the provisioning behaviour of each sex in a wild population of the chestnut thrush, Turdus rubrocanus. First, as expected, the mating pairs with more similar personality traits had higher provisioning rates than those pairs with dissimilar traits. Moreover, we found that the similarity of personality traits can modulate the sexual conflict over provisioning in this species, as both parents with more similar partners had relatively higher and less divergent provisioning rates. A partner removal experiment revealed how the sole female or male parent responded when the level of conflict over care increased (the removed partner does not provide any care). The majority of males always reduced their provisioning investment, while females' decisions depended on the degree of similarity with their partners. Females compensated by provisioning more frequently in pairs of similar personality traits (i.e. accepting a high level of conflict), but reduced their provisioning investment in extremely dissimilar pairs. Our results promote a better understanding of the resolution of sexual conflict over provisioning and highlight the evolutionary significance of mating with similar partners based on certain personality traits.

ID BEHAVIOR; DOMINANCE
AB When social animals forage together, they may engage in frequency-dependent strategies either as producers, those who acquire food with their own energy, or as scroungers, those who feed on what the producers discover. An individual's choice of strategy may depend on the frequency of strategies within the group, or it may depend on the individual's own traits. Most of our understanding of producer-scrounger relationships comes from highly social species, but we may gain different insights by studying less social species. We used novel puzzle box experiments to study social foraging relationships and identify the traits associated with strategy choice in facultatively social yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. We found that marmots had consistent strategies as either producers or scroungers. Furthermore, several individuals specialized as scroungers, following the producers to the puzzle box before other scroungers. However, their roles were only associated with sex (males were more likely to produce), and not with age, boldness or dominance rank. Marmots' lack of trait-regulated foraging roles may be associated with their relatively abundant and not-entirely defensible food, or may emerge from their lack of obligate social structure. We discuss how multiple factors may explain variation in social foraging behaviour. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Varying forms of polygyny are observed across many animal groups. In some species, a male defends a group of females from other males, and successful defence leads to greater reproductive success. This is often referred to as harem polygyny and is most observed in mammals. A female-biased sex ratio has been associated with harem polygynous species. In such populations, formation of 'harems' may be an inevitable consequence of the relative lack of available males, rather than multiple females actively choosing to mate with a subset of specific males. Although a rare mating system for insects, harem polygyny has been described in several orders, including tree weta (Orthoptera: Anostostomatidae: Hemideina) in New Zealand. Aggregations of multiple females have been found with a single male in their diurnal roosts. We aimed to determine how the sex ratio and local density of Hemideina thoracica affected the formation of harems in laboratory conditions. 'Harems' were observed when the sex ratio was female biased, but no more than would be expected by chance arrangement of individuals, although females preferred to associate with males rather than be alone. Conversely, when the sex ratio was male biased, females preferred to be alone. The number of females associated with each male was lowest when the sex ratio was even and local density was low. However, males and females did not associate randomly: when local density was high aggregations of multiple males with multiple females were observed more often than expected by chance, suggesting that, in contrast to classic 'harem' behaviour, males accepted other males being present as long as females were also found in the roost. Additionally, females were more likely to be associated with males than in low-density conditions. Individuals in this study showed much more flexibility in their mating behaviour than what would be expected in a harem polygynous species. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Acoustic communication mediates many types of social interactions; however, few studies have investigated whether courtship vocalizations contain distinctive individual signatures necessary for individual recognition. Male house mice, Mus musculus, produce spectrally complex ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during courtship and mating, which appear to attract females and increase male reproductive success. Our goals were to (1) describe quantitative and qualitative changes in the vocalizations of wild-derived male house mice, M. m. musculus, induced by a female odour stimulus; (2) measure individual variation and consistency in male USV emission over time; (3) test whether the variation in USVs is greater between than within individuals; and (4) identify individual signatures in spectrotemporal features using univariate statistics, multivariate models and machine learning methods. We recorded males once per week for 3 weeks, used an automated method (A-MUD) to detect USVs, and manually classified them into distinct syllables. We found that most males did not vocalize until they encountered female scent, and then most males dramatically increased the number and the types of different vocalizations (repertoire size and composition). Male USVs showed high interindividual variation and most showed intraindividual consistency, and we found greater inter- than intraindividual variation for both USV count and repertoire size. Male USVs contained individual signatures in most spectrotemporal features, regardless of the method of analysis. Males sometimes produced few, if any, vocalizations when presented with female scent, but consistent nonvocalizers were rare. Our study provides the first evidence that individual signatures in USVs of male house mice are stable over time and across recording trials, although studies are still needed to investigate repeatability across social contexts and to test whether USVs mediate individual recognition.

AB Courtship can have multiple, nonexclusive, functions, and it often plays a central role in mate choice. In the polyandrous, cannibalistic spider Argiope keyserlingi, males perform vibratory courtship that sup-presses female aggression. Although females appear to have a preference (i.e. they shorten their latency to mate) for males performing courtship displays with specific characteristics (i.e. many shudders with consistent shudder duration), they are not more likely to mate with them. Here, we asked whether in this species courtship quality plays a role in postcopulatory sexual selection, by affecting male fertilization success via cryptic female choice. We quantified male courtship performance in a standardized thread assay with no male-female interactions, which simulates male approach to the female on the web. We allowed each unmated adult female to mate with two males. Prior to mating, one male from each pair was sterilized using an irradiation treatment and offspring paternity was assigned using the sterile male technique. Unexpectedly, we found that irradiated males had a fertilization advantage over nonirradiated males. When we controlled for that bias, males performing courtship with a large number of shudders and long copula durations gained the largest paternity shares. Together with evidence from previous studies, our results suggest that courtship quality mediates cryptic female choice, but further in-vestigations are needed to parse out the influence of female control and sperm competition on paternity.

AB Behavioural polymorphisms associated with morphs with a known genetic basis are interesting to study since they provide a model system to investigate the molecular basis of complex behaviours. White-throated sparrows are one of such rare models, presenting two morphologies and behavioural types, tan and white, caused by a chromosomal rearrangement. The behavioural differences have been mainly studied during reproduction, defining two morph-specific breeding strategies and different levels of aggression between morphs. Outside of the breeding season, the morphological differences are less apparent, morphs are more difficult to distinguish and the behavioural polymorphism is poorly understood. In this study, we caught wild individuals during the winter, determined their morph by genetic analysis, and analysed the differences in behaviour between morphs when encountering a novel object under standardized conditions in captivity. White morphs are more aggressive during reproduction; therefore, we expected them to be less affected by the presence of the novel object than tan morphs; animal personality research shows that more aggressive individuals are less affected by the presence of novel objects (i.e. neophilic). Contrary to our expectations, white morphs were more neophobic than tan morphs, and within morphs, males were more neophobic than females. Furthermore, white morph individuals and males of both morphs suffered greater weight loss during captivity compared to tan morphs and females, respectively, suggesting that the response to captivity-induced stress differs between morphs and between sexes. Finding behavioural differences between morphs not related to reproduction implies a broader impact of the effects of the chromosomal rearrangement on the behavioural polymorphism in this species.

AB Behavioural plasticity can be costly, but is advantageous when it allows animals to adjust their behaviour to current conditions. Since individual differences in learning ability could be a source of differences in behavioural plasticity, the frequency dependence of payoffs within a foraging group may permit the coexistence of both plastic, fast-learning individuals and nonplastic, slow-learning individuals; in a frequency-dependent context the adjustments of a few benefit all. In this study, we investigated whether individuals that learned faster in a simple associative learning task were also more likely to adjust their behaviour in a social foraging game context than their slower-learning groupmates. We measured the associative learning ability of female Bengalese finches, Lonchura striata domestica, in a colour discrimination task and their degree of behavioural plasticity in tactic use when foraging conditions called for changes in the flock's producer-scrounger equilibrium. We found that behavioural plasticity was affected by learning speed. However, in contrast to our expectation, the slower learners were most plastic. We argue that behavioural plasticity in the producer-scrounger game context may require learning that is different from colour matching. We also propose that our results may be related to the fast-slow continuum; being proactive or fast and inaccurate could favour being responsive in simple asocial contexts while being reactive or slow and accurate could favour being plastic in more complex social contexts. Future empirical studies need to compare differences in behavioural plasticity in tactic use with learning speed measured in other types of learning tasks and with personality traits relevant to the fast-slow continuum.

AB In some species, cognition can change flexibly in response to environmental changes. These changes can be adaptive or can result from physiological constraints, such as when energy availability decreases seasonally. Here, we investigated: (1) how cognitive performance changes between seasons that differ significantly in food availability; (2) how these changes are related to environmentally induced physiological changes (blood glucose); and (3) whether experimental increase in blood glucose levels during the dry season impacts cognitive performance. We studied 93 free-ranging African striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in the Succulent Karoo, South Africa during the hot summer dry season with low food availability, and the cold wet winter with high food availability. Striped mice had reduced blood glucose levels during the food-restricted dry season. We measured their attention using the standardized orientation response test and their spatial memory using the Barnes maze test. Neither attention nor spatial memory changed seasonally. However, high basal and experimentally increased blood glucose levels impaired cognition in most cases. We also found sex differences in cognitive performance. Even though food was restricted in the dry season and blood glucose levels were reduced, cognition was not affected by these changes, indicating cognitive resilience, which represents an evolved adaptation to cope with seasonally changing energy supply in striped mice.

AB In group-living animals, behavioural interactions with conspecifics strongly modulate an individual's physiological stress response. Stable social relationships may reduce an individual's stress response, which in turn can affect the immune system and health. Ultimately, positive health effects of stable social bonds may contribute to maintaining group living. We investigated whether, in cooperatively breeding carrion crows, Corvus corone, the quality of social relationships correlates with the excretion of coccidian oocysts and nematode eggs. We repeatably collected behavioural data on dyadic social interactions and individual droppings to quantify parasite eggs and oocysts from 36 individuals in a captive population of carrion crows in northern Spain. Individuals with strong social bonds, living with more relatives and in larger groups, excreted a significantly smaller proportion of droppings containing coccidian oocysts. The probability of excreting droppings containing nematode eggs was not affected by social factors. The relationship between social interactions and coccidian oocyst excretion is consistent with the idea that high-quality social relationships can positively affect an individual's health, setting the stage for the evolution of stable social living.

AB Understanding patterns of diversity in sexual signals can give insight into processes initiating, mediating or following from species diversification. Here we focus on female sex pheromones, which are widespread among animals, where some taxa show phylogenetic patterns of variation, but for others, ecological factors better explain pheromone diversity. Causes of differences in these patterns are unclear, and general insights require studying a broader range of taxa. Here we examined variation in the responses of male redback spiders, Latrodectus hasselti, to sex pheromones produced by three allopatric female congeners with different degrees of phylogenetic relatedness (from the same Glade: Latrodectus mirabilis, Latrodectus hesperus; and from a different Glade: Latrodectus geometricus) to infer pheromone divergence. We examined variation in male responses to conspecific and heterospecific females' airborne and contact pheromones, which attract males and elicit courtship behaviour, respectively. We measured male courtship responses to extracted contact pheromones in isolation and male preferences in response to airborne pheromones and combined cues (pheromones, silk) in a two-choice maze. Male responses to airborne chemicals, contact chemicals and combined cues suggested variation in species specificity, with L. hasselti males showing strong discrimination against airborne pheromones of L. hesperus females (same Glade), moderate evidence for discrimination based on contact cues of L. geometricus, but only when multiple sources of information were available (different Glade), and no discrimination of L. mirabilis females (same Glade) relative to conspecifics, regardless of the types of information available. Thus, male responses were not consistent with a phylogenetic pattern. Moreover, airborne pheromones can apparently diverge relatively rapidly, but airborne and contact pheromones may remain similar across long evolutionary timescales. We propose that differential responses to L. hesperus may arise from selection for population-level pheromone divergence within that species and that, in general, pheromones and male responses may be evolutionarily conserved across Latrodectus.

AB In species with pronounced male armaments, body and weapon size often determine success in agonistic interactions. However, the behavioural components of interactions also play a significant role in determining outcomes and individuals that win agonistic interactions may not be the ones that start contests. In this study, we used dyadic, intrasexual assays to characterize agonistic behaviours and determine whether body size and/or the propensity to start interactions influences contest outcome. We characterized agonistic interactions from start to end in the sexually dimorphic forked fungus beetle, Bolitotherus cornutus. Males of the species are known to use their thoracic horns in intrasexual combat, but other aspects of male-male behaviour are undescribed. We created an ethogram that described transitions between behaviours and categorized actions as aggressive, nonaggressive and mounting. Individual aggressive and nonaggressive behaviours were highly repeatable between trials while mounting behaviours were not repeatable. The initiation of nonaggressive and mounting behaviours was not predictive of contest outcome. Relative body size and absolute aggression independently predicted contest outcome. Our results indicate that traits important for establishing contest outcome are not always correlated. Considering either aggression or body size alone may be misleading when determining competitor abilities. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal social networks have been studied intensively in the last decade, but there are relatively few studies of their temporal stability and variation, including the influence of season. We quantified the social network structure across time of a population of wild giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis, in South Africa. Our aim was to investigate differences between dry and wet seasons and stability across years of giraffe social structure. We found temporal stability in terms of association patterns across years, including between seasons, for the population as a whole and for each sex separately. A comparison of the mean social connectedness of individuals between the wet and dry seasons revealed significant differences, with individuals having more social ties and being stronger socially connected in the wet season. Further analyses revealed that this result stemmed from differences in female-female and intersexual associations, whereas there was no evidence for social connectedness among males being affected by season. In summary, while the extent of social connectedness differed between seasons, the overall social connection pattern of the population was stable over time. This study underlines the importance of long-term surveys of wild animals and their social networks and demonstrates that animals can adapt their social behaviour to ecological changes while simultaneously maintaining a stable social structure.

AB Animal social bonds are defined as stable, equitable and strong affiliative and cooperative relationships similar to human friendships. Just as with human friendships, social bonds are thought to function as alliances that generate adaptive benefits via support in critical situations. In humans, similarity in many sociodemographic, behavioural and intrapersonal characteristics leads to trust and is predictive of friendships. Specifically, personality homophily (that is, the tendency of individuals to form social bonds with others who have a similar personality) may increase predictability and facilitate trust and reciprocity between partners with compatible behavioural tendencies. While evidence for social bonding in animals is accumulating, far less is known about its predictors. Here, personality homophily effects on the formation and maintenance of social bonds are shown in 24 wild male Assamese macaques at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand. Dyadic bond strength increased with increased similarity in the trait Gregariousness (i.e. frequent and diverse neighbours within 5 m and pronounced social tolerance, as shown by high rates of friendly approaches to and by others). To differentiate whether homophily indeed predicted bond formation or whether bonded males' personalities became more similar over time, we tested the stability of the Gregariousness traits in a subset of immigrating males that had to form new bonds. Gregariousness in these males remained stable, suggesting that males do not adapt their personality to their partner. Our results support the idea of a shared evolutionary origin of homophily as a partner choice strategy in human and nonhuman animals. The main selective advantage of personality similarity in animal social bonds may result from a more reliable cooperation between individuals with similar cooperative behavioural tendencies.

AB Interspecific competition can strongly influence patterns of space use in animal communities, particularly between closely related species, and may be exacerbated in marginal habitat. This may be important in Madagascar, as lemurs face diminishing resources due to deforestation. We examined the range overlap and spatiotemporal relationships of three species of frugivorous lemur in the fragmented forests of Kianjavato, Madagascar. We conducted simultaneous location and behaviour sampling of black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata, red-fronted lemurs, Eulemur rufifrons, and red-bellied lemurs, Eulemur rubriventer, at two sites over a period of 11 months. We used Doncaster's index of dynamic interaction to investigate the relative amount of time species spent within 30 m and 100 m of each other, compared to the time expected based on random use of location points. All three species showed low core range overlap compared to home range overlap, and while core overlap was higher between interspecific groups than intraspecific groups, the difference was not substantial. Conversely, no spatiotemporal avoidance was observed, and red-fronted lemurs showed positive association (indicating possible attraction) with both red-bellied and ruffed lemurs. These positive spatiotemporal associations may be related to shared resource use in small forests, or predation avoidance strategies. At present, these species may rely more on spatial segregation and niche separation than spatiotemporal avoidance to minimize interspecific competition.

AB Animals have evolved a wide range of behaviours that act as barriers to decrease the risk of parasite infection. Faecal avoidance may, for example, limit contact with orofaecally transmitted parasites, such as gastrointestinal nematodes. When present in faeces, however, nematode eggs need to mature before reaching their infective stage. If strategies have evolved in hosts to specifically avoid nematodes, old faeces with infective larvae should elicit stronger avoidance behaviour than fresh faeces that contain noninfective stages. Here, we carried out two experiments to test the hypothesis that mandrills, Mandrillus sphinx, an Old-World primate, exhibit specific behavioural strategies to avoid nematode infection. Our results show that individuals did not avoid faeces in a nonfeeding context but did avoid eating food items contaminated with faecal material, females more so than males. However, neither the presence of nematodes nor the age of faeces influenced the level of avoidance observed, suggesting that mandrills avoid faecal material in general rather than nematodes specifically when foraging. 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   TEMPORAL VARIATION; DYNAMIC LANDSCAPE; DIETARY CUES; RESPONSES
AB Predator avoidance behaviour has been observed in many species and can strongly affect trophic interactions. Animals frequently adjust their response to predators in proportion to risk; however, when they are exposed to chronic predation risk, some animals reduce their antipredator responses in favour of resource acquisition. Animals that are subjected to predation pressure from multiple predator species may have to respond to different spatial and temporal distributions of risk; how they balance these risks will affect their choice of habitat or microhabitat patches. One species that is exposed to a wide range of predators is the pygmy salamander, Desmognathus wrighti. These miniaturized terrestrial plethodontids spend their entire life on the forest floor where they are exposed to a diversity of predators. We examined pygmy salamanders' ability to avoid potential predators based on the presence of substrateborne chemical cues. The predator species included ground beetles (Carabidae: Pterostichus), Jordan's salamanders, Plethodon jordani, and ring-necked snakes, Diadophis punctatus. The ring-necked snake is a trophic specialist feeding on salamanders while the beetles and Jordan's salamanders are generalist predators. The pygmy salamanders were also exposed to chemical alarm cues from a congeneric salamander (Desmognathus fuscus) and odours from two unfamiliar species: corn snakes (Pantherophis gutattus) and herbivorous desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii). We used a hierarchical Bayesian beta regression with a repeated measures design to model proportion of time spent in each treatment. Compared to controls, pygmy salamanders exhibited strong aversion to fed ring-necked snakes, a moderate avoidance of unfamiliar odours and a slight attraction to scents from the two common generalist predators. Our results suggest that pygmy salamanders accept modest risk from common generalist predators but avoid less common, specialist predators and unfamiliar species.

AB Choosing a mate is one of the most important decisions an animal can make. The fitness consequences of mate choice have been analysed extensively, and its mechanistic bases have provided insights into how animals make such decisions. Less attention has been given to higher-level cognitive processes. The assumption that animals choose mates predictably and rationally is an important assumption in both ultimate and proximate analyses of mate choice. It is becoming clear, however, that irrational decisions and unpredictable nonlinearities often characterize mate choice. Here we review studies in which cognitive analyses seem to play an important role in the following contexts: auditory grouping; Weber's law; competitive decoys; multimodal communication; and, perceptual rescue. The sum of these studies suggest that mate choice decisions are more complex than they might seem and suggest some caution in making assumptions about evolutionary processes and simplistic mechanisms of mate choice.

AB Vocal learning often results in distinct dialects among individuals or groups, but the forces selecting for these phenomena remain unclear. Female sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, and their dependent offspring live in matrilineally based social units, and the units associate within sympatric clans. The clans have distinctive dialects of codas (patterns of clicks), as do, to a lesser extent, the units within clans. We examined the similarity of coda repertoires of individuals and units from the eastern Caribbean and related these to patterns of kinship and social association. Similarity in coda repertoires was not discernibly correlated with close kinship or association rates for either individuals or units (matrix correlation coefficients <0.12 for all tests using whole repertoires and data from all units). This supports the prevailing hypothesis that these vocalizations are culturally transmitted. The lack of correlation also indicates that vocal learning may occur broadly within clans, rather than preferentially from close kin or close social associates within social units, or that biases in vocal learning at lower levels of social structure are diffused by clan-level processes, such as conformity. Finally, an absence of signals of kinship in vocalization patterns suggests that a different mechanism, perhaps familiarity through repeated association, mediates kin selection among sperm whales.

AB Camouflage can be achieved by both morphological (e.g. colour, brightness and pattern change) and behavioural (e.g. substrate preference) means. Much of the research on behavioural background matching has been conducted on species with fixed coloration and body patterns, while less is known about the role background choice plays in species capable of rapid (within minutes or seconds) colour change. One candidate species is the rock goby, Gobius paganellus, a common rock pool fish capable of rapid changes in colour and brightness when placed on different backgrounds. However, their ability to match different backgrounds is not unbounded, with some colours and brightness being easier to match than others, thus raising the possibility that gobies may use behavioural background matching to make up for their limited ability to match certain backgrounds. We used digital image analysis and a model of predator vision to investigate the ability of rock gobies to match chromatic (beige and greenish-grey) and achromatic (varying brightness) backgrounds. We then conducted choice experiments to determine whether gobies exhibited a behavioural preference for the backgrounds they were best at matching. Gobies rapidly changed their colour and brightness when placed on the different backgrounds. However, the level of camouflage differed between backgrounds: fish were better at matching beige than greenish-grey, and darker than lighter backgrounds. When given the choice, gobies displayed a behavioural preference for the backgrounds they were best at matching. Our findings therefore show that rock gobies, and probably other animals, use a combination of morphological and behavioural means to achieve camouflage and in doing so mitigate limitations in either approach alone.

AB The specialization of individuals in specific behavioural tasks is often attributed either to irreversible differences in development, which generate functionally divergent cooperative phenotypes, or to agerelated changes in the relative frequency with which individuals perform different cooperative activities; both of which are common in many insect caste systems. However, contrasts in cooperative behaviour can take other forms and, to date, few studies of cooperative behaviour in vertebrates have explored the effects of age, adult phenotype and early development on individual differences in cooperative behaviour in sufficient detail to discriminate between these alternatives. Here, we used multinomial models to quantify the extent of behavioural specialization within nonreproductive Damaraland mole-rats, Fukomys damarensis, at different ages. We showed that, although there were large differences between individuals in their contribution to cooperative activities, there was no evidence of individual specialization in cooperative activities that resembled the differences found in insect societies with distinct castes where individual contributions to different activities are negatively related to each other. Instead, individual differences in helping behaviour appeared to be the result of age-related changes in the extent to which individuals committed to all forms of helping. A similar pattern is observed in cooperatively breeding meerkats, Suricata suricatta, and there is no unequivocal evidence of caste differentiation in any cooperative vertebrate. The multinomial models we employed offer a powerful heuristic tool to explore task specialization and developmental divergence across social taxa and provide an analytical approach that may be useful in exploring the distribution of different forms of helping behaviour in other cooperative species.

AB Response patterns and underlying neural mechanisms of adaptive behaviours may be similar in different taxa. Among closely related species, this similarity may depend on shared innate motor programs. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the responses of the two-spotted cricket Gryllus bimaculatus to mechanical stimulation of the terminal abdominal appendages (cerci). Final instar juveniles (the last stage of insect larvae) mainly showed escape-like 'dart' responses to stimulation, while a defensive response ('up', 'kick' and 'turn' responses) increased in adult crickets. In older adults, the 'turn' response, in which animals turned towards the stimulus source and jerked their upper body in a threatening raised posture, became more frequent. Thus, the response patterns of crickets to tactile stimulation of the cerci changed from an escape response to a defensive response depending on age and growth. This behavioural plasticity was also dependent on social status. Paired crickets began fighting within 30 s to establish dominance status. Winning juveniles were more likely to show defensive responses and losing adults changed their response from defence to escape. This age- and social status-dependent behavioural plasticity is also observed in crayfish, suggesting a preservation of instinctive behavioural strategies in some arthropods.

AB Puppy packs (consisting of only puppies) and mixed-age packs (composed of puppies and adults) were observed to test whether social play can be used for assessing and establishing social relations in wolves, Canis lupus. Differently from previous studies, we looked at play behaviours in detail, allowing us to categorize play interactions as either competitive or relaxed, and predicted that different types of play would be associated with different relationships between individuals. We found that the more time dyads spent in relaxed play, the more affiliative interactions they exchanged outside of play. In the mixed-age packs, dyads that spent more time in both relaxed and competitive play showed fewer exchanges of aggressive behaviours. Conversely, in puppy packs, the more time dyads spent in competitive play, the more aggressive interactions were exchanged outside of play. Since clear dominance relationships emerged in the mixed-age packs, but not in puppy packs, we suggest that play can help to reduce the frequency of aggressive interactions only when a clear hierarchy exists between pack members. Furthermore, we found that in both puppy and mixed-age packs, dominance relationships were reflected and rarely reversed during play. Finally, dyads with a less clear dominance relationship spent more time playing in a competitive way. Overall, our results support the social assessment hypothesis suggesting that social relationships outside of play are reflected during playful interactions. Moreover, we revealed how different types of play, that is, playing in a competitive or relaxed way, may be related to different social relationships. This distinction between play types has not been acknowledged before but could help researchers better understand the functions of play in different species. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB In humans and other vertebrates, sensory information is sometimes lateralized towards one brain hemisphere that dominates the control of a task. Although sensory lateralization may depend on the stimuli being processed, the degree or direction of lateralization can differ according to behavioural phenotype. Accordingly, personality may play an important role in lateralization, yet there is a lack of evidence regarding how lateralizations are utilized to process information and promote a personality-based response to a particular situation. Here we show that simultaneous stimulus processing and organization of personality-based responses can be accomplished via differences in laterality between senses. We demonstrate this by examining novel object inspection in the weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersn. We found that electrosensing is lateralized in this species, but differently between personality phenotypes: bold fish were lateralized towards the right hemisphere and timid fish the left. By contrast, visual laterality did not vary with personality; rather the left hemisphere was dominant across the population, as is common for fish when visually analysing unfamiliar objects. This evidence reveals differences in functional laterality between sensory systems and the role of personality in eliciting these differences. The species has a stronger input of electrical signals than visual signals in its brain; therefore, sensory representation in the brain might drive the laterality differences.

AB Female-limited dimorphism is commonly hypothesized to be an adaptation resulting from male harassment or sexual conflict over female mating rate. We examined whether males discriminate between female colour morphs of the beautiful Hawaiian damselfly, Megalagrion calliphya, in order to evaluate whether male harassment could explain the existence and/or maintenance of this dimorphism. Previous studies of this species suggest that spatially varying ecological selection maintains the dimorphism, but these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Here, we used a common method of measuring male behaviour towards secured females at mating sites under naturally occurring conditions, using five populations that range in male-like female morph frequency from 0 to 0.86. We found very low rates of interaction in a total of 64 one-hour trials, and male behaviour towards females did not differ significantly between colour morphs. By comparing the populations that vary in female morph frequency, we found no evidence of frequency-dependent sexual selection on colour, suggesting that this polymorphism is maintained by selective forces other than sexual conflict.

AB There is growing evidence that social bonds have adaptive consequences for individuals in many mammalian species, including savannah baboons. While the majority of studies have shown that the strength of social bonds and the extent of social integration enhance female fitness, several other investigations have suggested that the number of social bonds may sometimes may be more important than the strength or quality of females' social relationships. Here, we examine the impact of the number of strong and weak social bonds on female fertility and longevity in a population of chacma baboons,Papio ursinus. We find no evidence that the number of social bonds consistently affects fertility or infant survival to 1 year, but offspring of females with more weak social bonds lived longer than offspring of other females. After discussing several methodological issues that may influence the analyses of the effects of the number of social bonds, we re-examine the relationship between the number of weak and strong social bonds and reproductive performance using procedures that avoid these problems. Again, we find no evidence that the number of weak or strong social bonds affects females' fertility, survival to 1 year. The effects of the number of weak social bonds on infant longevity disappear, and appear to be an artefact of the relationship between the number of weak social bonds and the number of females in the group.

AB To make foraging, reproductive and antipredator decisions, animals often have to discriminate discrete and continuous quantities (numbers and sizes of objects, respectively). Few studies have investigated discrete quantity discrimination in amphibians, but this has been done only in the context of prey selection. Using a species with arboreal habits, the Italian treefrog, Hyla intermedia, we investigated whether amphibians discriminate both discrete and continuous quantities when choosing between microhabitats. In field experiments, we showed that newly metamorphosed treefrogs exhibit a preference for microhabitats with abundant and tall grass. In the laboratory, treefrogs presented with the dichotomous choice between two sets comprising different numbers of vertical green bars (simulating grass clumps) showed a preference for the larger set and discriminated between 1 and 2 bars and between 2 and 4 bars, but not between 2 and 3 bars and between 3 and 4 bars. When presented with two bars of different size (i.e. one bar was taller and wider), treefrogs preferred the larger bar up to a 0.25 surface area ratio. Control experiments suggested that treefrogs represent numbers rather than continuous variables to discriminate between sets of bars and that they use the height but not the width of the bars to discriminate sizes. We also found evidence of a possible trade-off between speed and accuracy: individuals that chose more quickly did not display a significant preference for the larger bar/set of bars. These findings suggest that for amphibians, as for other vertebrates, a variety of decision-making processes can rely on quantitative abilities.

AB Animals sometimes possess extraordinarily enlarged or specialized structures used as weaponry for intrasexual combat. The way in which an animal's mating system leads to the diversity of exaggerated armaments we see in nature is a matter of current and ongoing research. Central to this enquiry is the question of how animal weapons are involved in assessment: how, when and why is the decision made to retreat from a contest by combatants fighting over their future fertilization success? We investigated the agonistic role of highly elongated male hindlegs in an Orthopteran insect found in dense aggregations in New Zealand caves: the cave weta, Pachyrhamma waitomoensis (Rhaphidophoridae). We found a large degree of sexual dimorphism in the hindlegs. In contests among males in the field, males with longer hindlegs were more likely to win contests, while body size did not influence contest outcome. We also assessed the influence of winner, loser and relative hindleg length on contest escalation, finding that fights among males with greater differences in leg length were resolved by less-escalated contests. In addition, the level of contest escalation was positively correlated with the loser's, but not the winner's, leg length, matching the predictions of self-only models of animal assessment.

AB Habitat loss and fragmentation, which are mostly anthropogenically caused, can lead to decreasing population sizes for many species. Consequently, the risk of inbreeding increases and inbreeding depression can be induced, which is likely to lead to a decline in fitness in inbred individuals. We investigated effects of inbreeding on fitness-related traits during ontogeny of a wild leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae, population. We also examined whether the behavioural phenotype, that is, personality, of adult beetles is affected by inbreeding, sex and/or age. We found evidence for inbreeding depression both at the larval stage and in adulthood. We tested the behaviour twice during adulthood and found that beetles show personality, that is, activity, exploration and boldness traits were repeatable and consistent across contexts. Moreover, the personality of inbred and outbred beetles differed significantly. In detail, boldness and exploration traits were affected by inbreeding, partly interacting with the beetles' sex or age. Most notably, inbred beetles were bolder in an unprotected environment than outbred beetles. Inbred individuals may be more risk prone in specific situations, because they have less to lose, since they reproduce less. As well as inbreeding effects on fitness-related traits, the results also show that the personality of arthropods can be affected by inbreeding. This is potentially related to inbreeding depression and thus to fitness declines in inbred individuals. Overall, decreased fitness combined with personality alterations of inbred individuals might affect the further development and survival of populations and thus possibly also (interactions with) other trophic levels of the ecosystem.

AB Corpse removal is a hygienic behaviour involved in reducing the spread of parasites and disease. It is found in social insects such as honeybees, wasps, ants and termites, insect societies that experience high populations and dense living conditions that are ideal for the spread of contagion. Previous studies on corpse removal have focused on perennial species that produce thousands of workers, a life history that may incur a greater need for hygienic behaviours. However, whether and how corpse removal occurs in annual species of social insect, which may experience different selection pressures for this behaviour, remains largely unknown. Here the corpse removal behaviour of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris was investigated by artificially adding larval and adult corpses into colonies. Larvae were removed more rapidly than adults, with adult corpses eliciting significantly more antennating and biting behaviours. Workers that removed larval corpses were significantly more specialized than the worker population at large, but this was not the case for workers that removed adult corpses. Workers that were previously observed spending more time inactive were slightly, but significantly less likely to perform corpse removal. Size did not affect whether a worker removed corpses, but workers that removed larvae were significantly larger than those that removed adult corpses. Finally, infecting larvae with the virulent parasite Nosema bombi did not elicit prophylactic removal. Our results provide the first quantification of corpse removal in an annual social insect and set the scene for comparative analyses of this important behaviour across social insect life histories.

AB Human-produced noise, from transport, urbanization and industry, is widespread. Studies of noise pollution show a wide range of effects on birds, such as alterations in communication, parental behaviour, physiology and reproductive success. These human-induced changes are likely to have long-term impacts, such as altered nestling physiology and survival, as well as reduced local population size. Further experimental field studies that simultaneously investigate the effects of noise exposure on avian behaviour, physiology and reproductive success are needed. Here, we used an experimental field study to investigate impacts of short-term traffic noise exposure on parental behaviour (i.e. vigilance and feeding rate), nestling body size and oxidative stress (as measured by oxidative status) and nestling fledging success in tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor. Our results show negative consequences of traffic noise exposure, despite a relatively modest playback regime (6 h, every other day). Adults in noise-exposed territories were less vigilant earlier in the nestling period and fed at a higher rate later in the nestling period, compared to controls. However, increased feeding rate in noise-exposed nests did not compensate for noise impacts on nestlings: noise-exposed nestlings were smaller and had higher oxidative status, compared to control nestlings. Noise-exposed nestlings took longer to fledge, but we found no effect of noise on fledging success. These results highlight the potential long-term consequences of short-term noise exposure (decreased nestling size and increased oxidative status) and add to a growing body of literature, showing that noise pollution can negatively impact birds through both direct and indirect pathways.

AB Mate choice has the potential to act on the evolution of motor performance via its direct influence on motor sexual signals. However, studies demonstrating this are rare. Here, we performed an in-depth analysis of Drosophila pseudoobscura courtship song rate, a motor signal under mate choice in this species, and analysed the response of this signal to sexual selection manipulation using experimental evolution. We show that manipulating the opportunity for sexual selection led to changes in song production rate and singing endurance, with males from the polyandrous populations producing faster song rates over longer time periods than males from monogamous populations. We also show that song rate was correlated with estimates of overall courtship vigour. Our results suggest that the action of mate choice on a motor signal has affected male motor performance displayed during courtship. We consider potential selective benefits associated with changes in motor performance, including condition-dependent signalling, and discuss the implications of these results for the study of motor signals under sexual selection.

AB Phenotypic plasticity plays a central role in determining how organisms respond to environmental change over short timescales. Despite this, we know little about how phenotypic plasticity varies between populations or species. We tested the extent of plasticity in basking behaviour in low-and high-altitude populations of two widespread lowland and two highland species of a cool-climate lizard genus: Niveoscincus. We found evidence of divergence in basking behaviour between populations and species, with highland species and high-altitude populations of all species basking more than the widespread lowland species and low-altitude populations. Furthermore, we found differences in the extent of behavioural plasticity between species. Widespread lowland species altered their basking behaviour depending on basking opportunity whereas the highland species maintained high levels of basking independent of basking opportunity. These differences in basking behaviour were concordant with the differences in body temperature across all populations, species and treatments. Combined, this suggests that divergence in thermoregulatory behaviour and thermophysiology between populations and species may have been facilitated by adaptive behavioural plasticity within populations. We discuss this and the implications of our findings for the ability of these animals to cope with ongoing climate change.

AB Understanding how animals experience stress in a laboratory environment is crucial for improving their welfare. Increasing numbers of fish are being used in scientific studies and further research is required to ensure appropriate conditions are used to promote good conduct and correct housing as well as guaranteeing scientifically valid results. As zebrafish are a gregarious species, social enrichment is particularly important, with individuals separated from a group experiencing isolation stress. The present study aimed to determine the effects of social context on recovery from common laboratory procedures. Additionally, we investigated whether the noninvasive measure of water-borne cortisol can be utilized to gauge physiological stress by comparing it to an invasive measure, whole-body cortisol concentration. Zebrafish (AB strain, male) were housed in differing social contexts and were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: undisturbed, anaesthetized and handled, or anaesthetized and fin clipped. Behavioural and physiological stress indicators were recorded before and after treatment. The results indicated social context, in the form of group housing, was important in enhancing recovery from welfare challenges in zebrafish, since group-housed fish resumed normal behaviours more quickly than pairs or individuals. Moreover, the strong correlation between water-borne and whole-body cortisol suggests that the noninvasive measure is an appropriate ethical alternative as an indicator of physiological stress. These findings represent an important refinement in reducing the severity of stress through housing zebrafish in their original groups and by adopting a noninvasive measure of cortisol which will act to reduce the numbers of individuals required for time series studies on physiological stress.

AB Nuptial gifts are under strong selection in terms of female choice. It is hypothesized that nuptial gifts represent an honest signal resulting from the trade-off between self-maintenance and mating effort. Furthermore, nuptial gift size may correlate with certain personality traits, such as male fighting or hunting abilities. We investigated the nuptial gifts of a gift-giving spider, Pisaura mirabilis, consisting of both exogenous (prey) and endogenous (silk) components and their relationships to male biometry (the honest signalling hypothesis) and personality traits (the personality traits hypothesis). The gift's weight in the field was positively correlated with male size providing support for the honest signalling hypothesis. No differences in body condition and fluctuating asymmetry between males carrying and not carrying gifts in the field were found which does not support the honest signalling hypothesis. A substantial proportion of males offered worthless gifts that were smaller and lighter than genuine gifts. Reliable personality traits of males were not identified and no behavioural or survival differences between males carrying nuptial gifts, unwrapped prey and not carrying gifts in the field were observed. These results suggest that male size serves as an honest indicator of the exogenous component of the gift (i. e. the nuptial prey). (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Even though leks have been widely used by biologists as a model to study sexual selection, we still do not understand how lekking individuals use space, interact and socially progress over time. This study aimed to provide new insights into lekking breeding dynamics using a high temporal and spatial resolution data set derived from the GPS tracking of adult male little bustards, Tetrax tetrax, collected over a 4-year period. We found the lekking system was dynamic at both intra-and interseasonal scales. Smaller ranges were consistent with territorial behaviour. Using Bayesian latent cluster analysis, based on the movements of each individual, we were able to distinguish between breeding behavioural modes, territorial and floating, within the breeding season. Surprisingly, only 27% of the males were found to be constantly territorial within the same year. The remaining birds showed predominantly floating behaviour or shifted between the two behavioural modes, floating and territorial, possibly indicating male turnover. Birds that were tracked for more than 1 year tended to return to the same breeding range. Floating males between years reduced their ranges within the same area and became territorial, indicating a trend for rank progression with increasing adult age. The combination of territorial site fidelity and male rank ascent based on age can explain the temporal persistence of leks within stable habitats.

AB Several bird species display periodic nocturnal sleep-wake patterns, resembling the ultradian rhythms expressed by mammals. Although relatively little is known about the underlying molecular properties of ultradian biological clocks, field observations demonstrate that the frequency of nocturnal awakenings (which may relate to rhythmicity) increases with ambient environmental temperature. To understand how ambient environmental temperature conditions affect the nocturnal sleep-wake pattern of birds, we experimentally heated nestboxes during the night and monitored the frequency and rhythmicity of awakening behaviour of roosting great tits. More than 80% of great tits displayed ultradian rhythmicity in major nocturnal awakenings, with awakenings occurring every 50-170 min. Experimental increases in temperature, on average, 5 C-omicron, caused birds to wake up approximately 30% more frequently over the course of the night, with the strongest temperature effect occurring during the first part of the night. However, the period length of the predominant nocturnal awakening rhythm was unaffected by increased temperature, likely because most additional awakenings were arrhythmic and clustered during the beginning of the night. We suggest that short-duration awakenings elicited primarily during the first part of the night may not be regulated by an ultradian biological clock, and may respond directly to current environmental conditions, such as the risk environment. Longer-duration awakening bouts, which were not affected by experimental heating, may instead be endogenously regulated by an ultradian clock to optimize clock-controlled sleep patterns and sleep homeostasis.

AB Theory predicts that sperm competition will favour the production of larger ejaculates. However, because the benefits of greater reproductive investment are balanced by the costs of spermatogenesis, expenditure should depend on male physiology, mating rate and the relationship between additional investment and fertilization gains. In the yellow dung fly, Scathophaga stercoraria, males adopt size-dependent alternative mating tactics that are associated with discrete ecological resources (foraging and oviposition substrates), although males switch between these environments throughout their lives. By copulating on foraging substrate (fruit or flowers), males can bypass intense mate competition that occurs at oviposition sites (cow dung), but as a consequence, must occupy a disfavoured mating role (i.e. face a greater risk that their ejaculate will be displaced from storage prior to fertilization). Small males often mate on foraging substrate, whereas large males mate in this environment only during feeding bouts. Optimal ejaculate expenditure should therefore depend on male size and their current mating role. By measuring copula duration (i.e. ejaculate expenditure) of natural matings and assigning paternity to resulting offspring, we confirmed that copulations on dung sire approximately three times as many offspring as those on foraging substrate. Furthermore, large males reduced copula duration on fruit, as predicted, since this strategy enables greater investment into high-payoff matings on dung. Conversely, small males copulated for shorter durations on dung than on foraging substrate, perhaps to minimize the risk of being displaced from copula by a rival. These patterns of ejaculate expenditure translated into greater offspring production for large males on dung and for small males on fruit. We discuss the possible proximate factors driving these size-and context-dependent patterns of ejaculate allocation by yellow dung fly males. Together, our findings shed light on the allocation strategies and reproductive consequences of alternative mating tactics. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The information transmitted by acoustic signals has attracted much scientific interest in recent years. However, isolation calls, which are long-distance vocalizations used by lost group members to reunite with their social group, have been surprisingly neglected. These calls assist in maintaining group cohesion and are thus particularly important in species that depend on the group for survival or reproduction such as cooperative breeders. Our study therefore examined the information transmitted by the isolation vocalization in a wild cooperatively breeding carnivore: the dwarf mongoose, Helogale parvula. We ran an acoustic analysis for informative cues within isolation calls, and conducted a series of playback experiments to identify whether mongooses could discriminate between callers based on these cues. The acoustic structure of dwarf mongoose isolation vocalizations contained information concerning the caller's identity, sex and potentially also group membership. Target mongooses discriminated between callers of their own and other groups and biased their response based on the sex of the caller. They responded more quickly and for longer, and approached more closely, for calls of foreign females than calls of female group mates. This is the first time that sex specificity has been demonstrated in the vocalization of an herpestid, and we suggest that dwarf mongooses eavesdrop on the calls of isolated foreigners and may use isolation calls to attract and identify potential mates.

AB Studies across a range of species have shown that sociability has positive fitness consequences. Among baboons, both increased infant survival and adult longevity have been associated with the maintenance of strong, equitable and durable social bonds. However, not all baboon populations show these patterns of bonding. South African chacma baboons, Papio ursinus, in the Drakensberg Mountains and De Hoop Nature Reserve show cyclical variation in social relations across time, with strong bonds formed only during certain times of the year. Using long-term data from the De Hoop baboons, we tested whether social relations influence female reproductive success in our study group in a manner similar to other baboon populations. Our results show that the number of strong bonds a female maintained predicted birth rate, and that the number of weak bonds a female possessed predicted infant 12-month survival and infant longevity. Fitness-related benefits of sociability were, however, independent of female dominance rank, and there was no relationship between the number of weak and strong bonds a female maintained. One possible explanation for the influence of weak as well as strong bonds in our study group may be that variation in demographic and ecological conditions across populations may favour the use of different social strategies by females. In our sample, weak bonds as well as strong bonds appear to be instrumental to achieving fitness-related benefits. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although some signals seem adapted to maximize transmission of cues to intended receivers, others appear to have been selected to deny specific types of cues to unwanted receivers. We review three categories of avian vocal signals that have been suggested to show adaptation for cue denial: aerial predator alarm calls, begging calls, and soft songs and calls. Evidence supports the conclusion that aerial alarm calls are adapted to deny localization cues and that begging calls and soft songs are adapted to deny detection. Selection for denial of cues in acoustic signals has also been documented in a variety of other animals. In summary, eavesdropping by unwanted receivers is often as important in shaping the structure of acoustic signals as is selection for transmission to intended receivers.

AB The social context experienced during early ontogeny can have lifelong consequences on the expression of social skills, and social isolation during development frequently impairs social competence. In this study, we used spiders as a model to investigate whether early social experience shapes social performance later in life. In spiders, the juveniles of all species show a transient gregarious phase that extends after their emergence from the maternal cocoon and ends with the initiation of agonistic interactions and cannibalism. Most studies that investigated social interactions in spiderlings focused on kin recognition. However, the potential mechanisms shaping recognition and discrimination, and particularly the role of early social experience, received little attention. Therefore, we examined to what extent early social isolation can influence the expression of social behaviours. We also investigated the influence of familiarity and kinship, and of their interaction with social experience on the expression of cannibalism. Our results showed that social isolation of spiderlings of Agelena labyrinthica since the egg stage did not influence social performance after emergence. Our study advocates for the existence of a species-specific chemical signature inhibiting cannibalistic tendencies in spiderlings.

AB Sex allocation theory as applied to local resource competition (LRC) predicts that parents should skew investment towards philopatric offspring when local resources are abundant. Alternatively, parents should allocate resources to the dispersing sex when local resources are deficient in order to limit competition among relatives. Nest sites have been shown to be the primary factor limiting populations of secondary cavity-nesting birds. In this study, we manipulated nestbox density to test its effect on the sex allocation patterns of the great tit, Parus major, a species in which female offspring are more likely to disperse than male offspring. We also investigated the relationship between the brood sex ratio and the time of breeding, which has been shown in many studies to influence sex allocation. Consistent with the LRC prediction, parents invested more in male offspring and produced a male-biased sex ratio in the area where nestboxes were abundant. In our study, the reproductive success of great tits declined as the season progressed; however, the time of breeding had no effect on the sex ratio of the offspring. Overall, the results of our study suggest that nestbox availability can influence sex allocation in great tits, and may also represent a relatively common phenomenon in other secondary cavity-nesting birds.

AB The geomagnetic field (GMF) is not constant but changes over space and time. In addition to the current slow decay of GMF, sudden GMF anomalies, mainly characterized by reduced field intensity, and variation in GMF strength between the migration origin and destination areas of migratory animals have attracted growing attention from researchers. We investigated magnetic field effects (MFEs) triggered by the near-zero magnetic field (NZMF), to some extent a proxy for the reduced GMF, on the positive phototaxis and flight capacity of the adult migratory white-backed planthopper, Sogatella furcifera. For the first time, we report the significant enhancement of adult positive phototaxis by the NZMF compared with the GMF. Compared with the GMF, NZMF also affected the flight capacity of adults (with significantly lower body weights) in a sexually dimorphic way. We further found that expression patterns of the multifunctional cryptochromes (genes CRY1 and CRY2) as circadian photoreceptor and magnetoreceptor, along with the genes AKH and AKHR in the adipokinetic hormone (AKH)/AKH receptor (AKHR) signalling system which is related to energy metabolism and antioxidative stress reactions, correlated with phenotypic changes in positive phototaxis and flight endurance of adults. Therefore, potentially acting through an antioxidative stress-related CRYs-circadian clock-AKH/AKHR signalling pathway, we suggest that a reduced field intensity, and even just variation in GMF, may influence positive phototaxis and flight (migratory) behaviour of insects. Our study presents a feasible link between the probable mechanisms underlying MFEs, including cryptochrome-mediated light-dependent magnetosensitivity, cryptochrome-mediated light-dependent magnetosensitivity of the circadian clock and magnetic field-triggered oxidative stress, and provides new insights into the complexity of potential MFEs induced by variation in GMF.

AB Female polyandry and corresponding multiple paternity have been detected in many species. Several hypotheses, such as the fertility guarantee hypothesis, the good gene hypothesis, the genetic compatibility hypothesis and the genetic diversity hypothesis, have been proposed to explain the evolution of female polyandry. Anuran amphibians are widely observed to breed in polyandrous spawning groups; however, few studies have evaluated multiple paternity in these species or the evolutionary mechanisms underlying polyandry. In this study, we addressed these questions pertaining to polyandry in the Omei treefrog, Rhacophorus omeimontis. Eight microsatellite markers of R. omeimontis were used to determine the patterns of paternity. Paternity analyses revealed that offspring were multiply sired in a majority (79.07%) of the polyandrous spawning groups. A male's reproductive output during a breeding season was greatly affected by the mating rate, revealing that male fitness benefited from multiple copulations. By contrast, no evidence supported the fertility guarantee hypothesis that polyandry increases the fertility rate of females or the compatible/good gene hypotheses that polyandrous females produce more compatible or superior offspring. The increased allelic diversity observed in polyandrous clutches is probably a nonadaptive by-product of multiple mating. In conclusion, males join as many copulations as possible to increase their reproductive success, regardless of whether their mate has already been in amplexus with other males. Females may gain no benefits from polyandry but are incapable of preventing superfluous males from joining the mating group due to the physical characteristics and breeding behaviour of anurans. Thus, in R. omeimontis, male pursuit of higher reproductive success is the primary explanation for female polyandry. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In gregarious animals, social interactions frequently take the form of dominance hierarchies that maintain stable relationships between individuals, and settle disputes without extra costs. Traits that function as signals of status can play an important role in mediating interactions among individuals, both in social and in sexual contexts. Carotenoid ornaments are more generally assumed to be sexually selected and not so relevant to general social contexts. However, it is possible for them to function in social contexts if they signal socially relevant aspects. Here we experimentally analysed social dominance and resource control in male groups of a gregarious species, the European serin, Serinus serinus, in relation to a sexual ornament. We tested whether yellow carotenoid-based plumage coloration, age, body size and testosterone were predictors of social dominance over a nonsexual resource (i.e. feeding context). We showed that dominance hierarchies were steep and were related to testosterone levels and ornamental coloration, particularly the male yellow carotenoid-based crown patch. Our results suggest that carotenoid-based colour and testosterone levels can be reliable predictors of social status in agonistic encounters in groups of male serins. Moreover, together with previous work on the sexual function of male coloration, this study provides evidence that male serin yellow coloration has a dual function in both sexual and nonsexual contexts. These results raise the possibility that this ornament may have evolved and be maintained via social selection over social competition/cooperation for reproductive opportunities and ecological resources.

AB One of the most effective adaptations to counter avian brood parasitism is rejection of the parasitic egg, yet relatively few hosts reject eggs of the brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater. Studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet (UV; 300-400 nm) reflectance of eggs plays a role in egg rejection by hosts of parasitic cuckoos Cuculus spp. Only two studies have experimentally tested whether a cowbird host utilizes UV light when making egg rejection decisions, and those studies found no evidence that UV light was a significant factor. We experimentally blocked the UV reflectance of one host egg in the clutches of three rejecter species: brown thrasher, Toxostoma rufum, American robin, Turdus migratorius, and grey catbird, Dumetella carolinensis, to determine whether they utilize UV reflectance when rejecting eggs. We also measured the UV reflectance of each species' eggs. All host species rejected more of their own UV-blocked eggs than they did control eggs, but brown thrashers were significantly more likely to reject their own UV-blocked eggs than were American robins and grey catbirds. Brown thrasher eggs also reflected significantly more UV light than both American robin and grey catbird eggs. Our results coupled with those from similar studies suggest that hosts with brighter UV-reflecting eggs should be more likely to reject UV-blocked eggs than hosts with duller UV-reflecting eggs. This is the first study to demonstrate that UV reflectance is a parameter used by hosts of the brown-headed cowbird when rejecting eggs and further increases our understanding of the mechanisms of egg recognition in brood-parasitic hosts.

AB Olfaction is the primary sensory modality involved in social cognition among rodents. Eusocial naked mole-rats live in large subterranean colonies with different castes and subcastes of individuals showing unique behavioural profiles. Thus, these animals are constantly faced with social decisions, which are key to colony maintenance and survival. Previous evidence suggests that naked mole-rats use olfaction for colony-level and individual recognition. To explicitly test a role for olfaction in naked mole-rat social decision making, we impaired function of the main olfactory system using zinc sulphate and measured performance in three behavioural paradigms: social dominance, social recognition and olfactory preference. We report that olfactory impairment significantly affected social dominance scores but that body mass was by far the most important variable for this behaviour. We confirm that naked mole-rats perform individual-level social recognition and that they prefer familiar versus unfamiliar colony olfactory cues. Although zinc sulphate decreased chemoinvestigatory behaviour in both the social recognition and olfactory preference paradigms, animals were still able to discriminate between stimuli, demonstrating that the main olfactory system is not necessary for social decision making in this species. A role for the accessory olfactory system is implied, although additional sensory cues, particularly auditory, must also be considered. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Task differentiation in cooperative groups can arise through a wide range of mechanisms. A recent hypothesis, supported by empirical studies of social spiders, suggests that a variation in individual personalities might be one such mechanism. Personality-based task differentiation can either arise as an emergent property of group living based on inherent behavioural variation among individuals, or alternatively it could be an adaptation to permanent sociality favoured by individual fitness benefits arising from increased group efficiency and productivity. We tested whether personality-based task differentiation is present in the temporarily social spider Stegodyphus tentoriicola which represents the ancestral state from which permanent sociality in spiders has evolved. This species is closely related to the permanently social Stegodyphus sarasinorum in which personality-based task differentiation has been documented. We measured individual boldness and investigated individual participation in simulated prey capture events twice per day on 5 consecutive days. We found no evidence for personality-based task differentiation: S. tentoriicola spiders did not exhibit consistent personalities in boldness or consistent task differentiation in prey attack. Our results lend support for the hypothesis that personality-based task differentiation is an adaptation to permanently social living in spiders as their ancestral representative lacks this trait.

AB Cooperative breeding typically evolves within discrete, stable groups of individuals, in which group members derive direct and/or indirect fitness benefits from cooperative behaviour. In such systems, strong selection on group discrimination should emerge. Despite this prediction, relatively few studies have investigated the mechanism of group discrimination in cooperative vertebrates, and the results of many may be confounded by 'expectancy violation', since test individuals from which stimuli were derived remained in the group during experimentation. Here, we used a novel experimental protocol that eliminates this confounding effect in a test of group discrimination in cooperatively breeding chestnut-crowned babblers, Pomatostomus ruficeps, using long-distance contact calls. Long-distance contact calls were found to be individually specific, but to lack obvious group level signatures. Using dual playbacks of removed group and nongroup members, we found that these calls allow effective discrimination: groups unanimously approached the speaker broadcasting calls of group members and concomitantly increased their contact call rates. Together, our results suggest that group discrimination emerges from individual recognition. Additionally, the affiliative behaviour of group members towards playbacks of removed members contrasts with the aggressive responses towards nongroup members found in all other studies. One explanation for these differences stems from our elimination of expectancy violation, but further studies are required to verify this. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Nest sanitation is an understudied form of parental care that may improve offspring fitness by reducing microbes and ectoparasites in the nest. Many species clean nests, but it is unknown whether parents respond flexibly to various costs and benefits when deciding how much effort to invest. We experimentally manipulated brood size in the short term and in the long term in a cavity nester, the northern flicker, Colaptes auratus, to test whether parents alter their sanitation effort in response to brood demands. Males generally removed more faecal sacs than females at all treatments and in most cases, faecal removal rates were proportional to feeding rates in control and experimental broods. The rate of sac removal was negatively correlated with feather corticosterone in females but not in males. Males maintained higher faecal removal rates than females to enlarged broods and were more flexible than females in altering their sanitation effort relative to their feeding rate. Single males, but not females, removed fewer faecal sacs than paired males, suggesting that males reduce nest sanitation effort in times of high nestling demands if it helps maximize fledging success. Across taxa, the sex that invests the most in other forms of parental care also seems to perform more nest sanitation, and future studies should test how parents value it differently depending on brood demands and intrinsic factors.

AB Distinguishing between interspecific and intraspecific coevolution as the selective driver of traits can be difficult in some taxa. A previous study of an avian obligate brood parasite, the black-headed duck, Heteronetta atricapilla, suggested that egg rejection by its two main hosts (two species of coot) is an incidental by-product of selection from conspecific brood parasitism within the hosts, not selection imposed by the interspecific parasite. However, although both species of coot can recognize and reject eggs of conspecific brood parasites, which closely resemble their own, they paradoxically also accept a moderate fraction of duck eggs (40-60%), which differ strikingly in shape and colour from their own eggs. Here we test the key assumption of the incidental by-product hypothesis that natural selection for egg recognition solely from conspecific brood parasitism can result in intermediate levels of rejection of nonmimetic eggs. We repeated the same egg rejection experiments conducted previously with the two Argentine hosts in a third closely related species that experiences only conspecific brood parasitism, the American coot, Fulica americana. These experiments yielded the same intermediate rejection rates for nonmimetic duck eggs. Our results confirm that selection from conspecific brood parasitism can lead to counterintuitive intermediate rejection rates of nonmimetic interspecific eggs and further support the suggestion that selection from antagonism within species can incidentally affect interactions between species.

AB Much theoretical work has been done regarding patch exploitation in insects and several mechanisms have been proposed to describe and predict behaviours under different situations. However, almost no theoretical framework has been developed for parasitoids with host-seeking larvae, even though similar selection pressures are faced by the female of hymenopteran parasitoids and the larvae of dipteran parasitoids. Here we propose and show that factors such as pre-parasitism competition and host physiological state can modulate host orientation and acceptance behaviours in a dipteran parasitoid larva. When larvae were exposed to pre-parasitism competition and then offered different host odours and live hosts, they oriented towards and more readily accepted suboptimal hosts and were more prone to superparasitize. Our results show that the internal state modulates individual decisions that dipteran parasitoids make, confirming the presence of many previously neglected strategies in parasitoids with host-seeking larvae. Hence, comparative studies should be undertaken to form a complete picture of parasitism strategies. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the wolf spider Rabidosa punctulata, upon encountering a female, males use one of two distinct strategies: (1) they court the female in an attempt to elicit a mating, or (2) they engage in a direct-mount tactic that involves extensive grappling with the female until a mating is achieved. The latter tactic appears more sexually aggressive, and both tactics come with the risk of being cannibalized. We explored the physiological mechanisms underlying this behavioural variation by assessing the relationship between circulating levels of the biogenic amine octopamine (OA), a neuromodulator suggested to play a role in 'fight or flight' responses of arthropods and male mating tactic expression. We predicted, and found support for, a relationship between OA levels and tactic expression, with males adopting the direct-mount tactic expressing higher OA levels than courting males. Male mating tactic and mass also showed a significant interaction, with a negative trend in direct-mounting males and no relationship in courting males. Males had considerably higher levels of OA circulating in their haemolymph than females and female OA level increased with female mass. Our experimental design cannot disentangle cause from effect, but our results are consistent with the hypothesis that OA plays a role in regulating mating tactic expression in R. punctulata.

AB Although evolutionary theory predicts that parents should discriminate between their own and others' offspring when levels of parental care are large, in some colonial breeding mammals, strong selective pressure would be expected to drive the evolution of mutual recognition between parents and offspring. Although less well studied than parental discrimination, in both birds and mammals, offspring discrimination of parents has also been documented. Nocturnal bats depend heavily on acoustic signals for communication, although little is known about whether bat pups can recognize their mothers based solely on maternal calls. We first investigated whether maternal calls of pomona leaf-nosed bats differ statistically among individuals. Then, we tested whether pups recognize their mothers' calls using a playback experiment. Echolocation pulses and directive calls of mother bats contain enough individual characteristics to allow for individual discrimination. Playback experiments showed that the pups responded with more vocalizations to playback of their own mother's versus another mother's directive calls, but not to playback of their own mother's versus another mother's echolocation pulses, suggesting that offspring can distinguish directive calls, but not echolocation pulses, of their own mother from those of other mothers. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which directive calls from bat mothers have been used to elicit vocalizations from pups and the first study to indicate that pups can recognize their mothers based solely on directive calls. These results advance our understanding of the function of acoustic signals in mothere-offspring recognition and the adaptive benefit of such communication, particularly the conditions under which a pup's recognition of its mother is critical.

AB Learning can be instrumental in acquiring new skills or optimizing behaviour, but it is also costly in terms of energy and when maladaptive associations are formed: the balance between costs and benefits affects memory dynamics. Numerous studies have demonstrated that memory dynamics of animal species depend on the value of the reward during conditioning, even when animals are inexperienced with this reward. How an animal perceives reward value depends on a number of aspects, including the quantity or quality of the reward in terms of energy or fitness for the animal, the internal state of the animal and previous experience. The reliability of the learned association is another aspect, which can be assessed through the frequency of experiences, or through perception of inherent properties of the reward. The reward in oviposition learning of parasitic wasps is a host to parasitize. Different host species can differ in their reward value. This study focused on a specific aspect of reward value, namely host value, i.e. the number and size of emerging offspring, and tested the effect on oviposition learning in parasitic wasps of the genus Nasonia. We conditioned parasitic wasps of the species Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti using three different host species as a reward, which differed greatly in their value as a host. However, for both parasitic wasp species, the resulting memory formation was independent of the value of the host. We discuss factors that may be responsible for this observation.

AB Discriminating between the sexes when one sex resembles the members of the other sex may be challenging. When sexual mimicry imposes costs on signal receivers, receivers can minimize confusion by using nonmimetic cues that differ between the models and the mimics. We tested this hypothesis in a female-specific polymorphic damselfly Enallagma hageni, whose blue coloration of andromorphic females resembles that of males, whereas the heteromorphic females have a distinctive green colour. Both female morphs share an abdominal pattern that differs from the males'. We predicted that males selectively use both colour (the mimetic cue) and pattern (the nonmimetic cue) in sex recognition: they use the nonmimetic cue only when the encountered individual has the mimetic colour. We modified the abdominal pattern of males, andromorphs and heteromorphs to resemble that of the opposite sex, and recorded males' reactions to pattern-altered and control individuals both in an arena and in the field. Our results supported our hypothesis. We then derived and tested potential male decision rules based on the two visual cues for sex recognition. We presented focal males with unnatural, orange females possessing either a male or female abdominal pattern, and recorded the reactions of mate-searching males to individuals with a novel pink-painted phenotype. Males reacted sexually to orange-and pink-painted individuals regardless of the abdominal pattern. Collectively, our results support a male discrimination rule of 'if not blue, then female', providing insights into the origin of phenotypic novelty in colour-polymorphic species.

AB Mimicry systems are frequently categorized by the type of benefit gained by the mimic's resemblance to its model: protection from threat, including predation (protective mimicry), and increased access to resources, including prey items (aggressive mimicry). These category types may not be mutually exclusive, and some mimics may gain more than one type of benefit. Here we examined a contentious classic textbook example of mimicry between the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus and its mimic, the sabre-toothed blenny Aspidontus taeniatus. We found that the benefit obtained by the sabre-toothed blenny varied between four geographical locations. At the Great Barrier Reef, in Indonesia and in the Red Sea, it rarely attacked reef fish victims, but instead relied on other food sources such as substrate items, damselfish eggs and tubeworms. Here, the main function of the mimicry system could be to protect the sabre-toothed blenny from predation (protective mimicry) and was consistent with a previous study in Japan. However, in French Polynesia, the sabre-toothed blenny aggressively attacked reef fish frequently, and potential victims were more likely to pose to solicit a cleaning interaction. Diet analysis from individuals in French Polynesia indicated material was gleaned from the surface of fish, including large pieces of fin, implying an increase in the benefits obtained from attacking reef fish (aggressive mimicry). This study provides a potential second example of a mimicry system in which multiple types of benefits are gained by a mimic, and importantly, that the benefits obtained by the mimic vary between different environmental conditions and/or geographical locations. This may have important implications for the maintenance and evolution of mimicry systems and may reflect different stages of an arms race with potential victims.

AB Social complexity, often estimated by group size, is seen as driving the complexity of vocal signals, but its relation to olfactory signals, which arguably arose to function in nonsocial realms, remains underappreciated. That olfactory signals also may mediate within-group interaction, vary with social complexity and promote social cohesion underscores a potentially crucial link with sociality. To examine that link, we integrated chemical and behavioural analyses to ask whether olfactory signals facilitate reproductive coordination in a strepsirrhine primate, the Coquerel's sifaka, Propithecus coquereli. Belonging to a clade comprising primarily solitary, nocturnal species, the diurnal, group-living sifaka represents an interesting test case. Convergent with diurnal, group-living lemurids, sifakas expressed chemically rich scent signals, consistent with the social complexity hypothesis for communication. These signals minimally encoded the sex of the signaller and varied with female reproductive state. Likewise, sex and female fertility were reflected in within-group scent investigation, scent marking and overmarking. We further asked whether, within breeding pairs, the stability or quality of the pair's bond influences the composition of glandular signals and patterns of investigatory or scent-marking behaviour. Indeed, reproductively successful pairs tended to show greater similarity in their scent signals than did reproductively unsuccessful pairs, potentially through chemical convergence. Moreover, scent marking was temporally coordinated within breeding pairs and was influenced by past reproductive success. That olfactory signalling reflects social bondedness or reproductive history lends support to recent suggestions that the quality of relationships may be a more valuable proxy than group size for estimating social complexity. We suggest that olfactory signalling in sifakas is more complex than previously recognized and, as in other socially integrated species, can be a crucial mechanism for promoting group cohesion and maintaining social bonds. Thus, the evolution of sociality may well be reflected in the complexity of olfactory signalling. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Social calls conveying identity yield several advantages in managing social group living. Signalling identity to conspecifics and the perception of the calling individual by receivers allow for appropriate behavioural responses based on experience of previous interactions. Contact calls help maintain group cohesion and often provide individual signatures. Giant otters, endemic to Amazonian rainforests and wetlands, are a highly social and vocally active species. Their family groups consist of a monogamous alpha pair with offspring of different ages, and elder siblings assist in rearing the young. During collective fishing bouts, individuals frequently become separated from their group. Giant otters use two types of cohesion calls. The 'contact call' is often uttered when the otters are visually separated, and is then followed by the reunion of group members. The 'hum' is produced in close proximity to manage group movements. We predicted giant otters would have individually distinct cohesion calls and be able to discriminate between the cohesion calls of different individuals. We recorded and measured calls from wild and captive individuals and conducted habituation-dishabituation playbacks with two captive groups. Our results provided statistical evidence for a strong individual signature in contact calls but not in hums. Nevertheless, the giant otters were able to distinguish individuals in both cohesion calls tested. We conclude that individual signatures seem to be advantageous in terms of managing group movements. Giant otters might additionally benefit from discriminating individuals within their social group, where kin recognition is insufficient to identify equally related individuals that cooperate in hunting and rearing of the young.

AB We studied the nature of information that frugivorous foragers take into account to increase their chances of discovering bountiful fruit crops. We recorded the foraging behaviour of five adult female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, for continuous periods of 4-8 weeks, totalling 275 full days, throughout multiple fruiting seasons in the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. We found that chimpanzees fed on individual trees that were significantly larger than other available and reproductively mature trees of the same species, especially if their fruit emitted an obvious smell. Trees that were merely checked for edible fruit, but where monitoring could not have been triggered by olfactory or auditory cues because the tree did not carry fruit, were also significantly larger. Most trees were monitored along the way during travel, but 13% were approached in a goal-directed manner (assessed using a 'change point test'). These approaches were unlikely to have been initiated by visual cues and occurred more often when females foraged solitarily and when trees were large as opposed to small. Our results suggest that goal-directed monitoring is guided by a long-term 'what-where' memory of the location of large potential food sources. These findings were confirmed in a quasiexperiment that tested which of 15 876 potential food trees with different crown sizes were approached in a goal-directed manner. Observations on one female who was followed intensively over 3 consecutive years indicated that monitoring probability was highest for trees with which she had become more familiar through frequent previous visits and that had carried more fruit, suggesting that she was able to remember this information across fruiting seasons. Long-term phenological data on individual trees indicated that the interval between successive fruiting seasons, and hence the 'memory window' of chimpanzees required for effective monitoring activities, could be up to 3 years.

AB Organisms that do not provide parental care are challenged with multiple factors and risks in the selection of an oviposition site. Oviposition site selection greatly affects offspring fitness, but little is known about how females respond to fine-scale variation in environmental cues. The seed beetle, Mimosestes amicus, shows remarkable behavioural plasticity in response to variation in egg parasitism cues. When exposed to egg parasitoid adults, females superimpose eggs atop each other to protect bottom eggs from parasitism. Here, we examined egg protection behaviour in response to the microspatial distribution of parasitized eggs. We exposed females to treatments varying in the number and dispersion of parasitized eggs on seed pods. Our results showed that oviposition behaviour was influenced by the evenness of the distribution of parasitized eggs and suggest that M. amicus exhibits a conditional strategy on a highly localized ` pod-by-pod' basis. When pods bore no eggs or unparasitized eggs, beetles laid the greatest number of eggs, almost all singly. In contrast, stacking was greatest and oviposition most reduced when parasitized eggs were distributed across all of the five pods provided. Lastly, females avoided ovipositing on seed pods with parasitized eggs when other oviposition sites were available. In general, avoidance behaviour increased, stacking increased and oviposition decreased as the number of pods (one, three or five) with parasitized eggs increased. Our results provide novel evidence of an oviposition strategy that combines both risk avoidance and offspring protection. Avoidance behaviours and reductions in oviposition rate are likely to be obscure among animals and may be more common than has been documented to date.

AB Pairs of duetting birds can sing coordinated duets with such precision that they are often mistaken for a single individual, yet little is known about how this impressive temporal synchronization is achieved. We experimentally examined duet coordination in male happy wrens, held briefly in captivity, by playing song phrases from their partner at different distances and tempos. Males were more likely to respond to songs played nearby, but did not vary their amplitude to compensate for their partner's simulated distance. Males modified their song rate to match the manipulated female playback tempo, indicating that they listen and respond to each female utterance. Each happy wren has a sex-specific repertoire of about 40 different song phrases and pairs combine particular phrases according to pair-specific duet 'codes', creating a further challenge for coordinating duets. We found that most males produced the appropriate phrase to reply to the female playback song in the absence of any other potential cues, sometimes delivering the correct song phrase type within 0.5 s of the start of the very first female playback heard. These experiments demonstrate rapid decision making and vocal production, indicative of sophisticated underlying cognitive processing, and provide a novel experimental technique to investigate the mechanisms controlling vocal duets.

AB Bees foraging for nectar often have to discriminate between flowers with similar appearance but different nectar rewards. At the same time, they must be vigilant for ambush predators, such as crab spiders, which can camouflage themselves on flowers. We investigated whether bees, Bombus terrestris, can efficiently discriminate similar flower colours while exposed to predation threat from cryptic predators. Bees were individually tested in tightly controlled laboratory experiments using artificial flowers whose nectar supply was administered with precision pumps. Predation risk was simulated by automated crab spider 'robots' that captured bees for a limited duration without injuring them. Bees' behaviour was monitored by a 3D video tracking system. We experimented with both cryptic and conspicuous spiders, finding that bees had no difficulty avoiding conspicuous spiders while still foraging adaptively. Conversely, they prioritized predator avoidance at the expense of maximizing energy intake when faced with detecting cryptic predators and a difficult colour discrimination task. This difference in behaviour was not due to cognitive limitations: bees were able to discriminate between similar flower types under predation risk from cryptic spiders when choosing the safe flower type incurred a gustatory punishment in the form of bitter quinine solution. However, this resulted in bees incurring substantially higher costs in terms of floral inspection times. We conclude that bees have the capacity to attend to difficult foraging tasks while simultaneously avoiding cryptic predators, but only do so when avoidance of gustatory punishment justifies the increased costs.

AB Young brood-parasitic birds must solicit provisions from other species, their hosts. The acoustic structure of the begging call has been proposed to help parasites secure host care in cases where they mimic the host's call, on the basis that parents respond best to their own species' call type. We investigated whether nonmimetic calls can also manipulate host provisioning in the parasite's favour. Nestlings of the generalist brood-parasitic shiny cowbird, Molothrus bonariensis, produce 'tremulous' calls comprising repeated syllables, wholly unlike the 'chip' calls of a common host, the house wren, Troglodytes aedon. We broadcast both call types, matched for call rate and amplitude, at unparasitized wren broods and found that parents provisioned more during broadcast of cowbird calls than those of their own species' young. Further experiments showed that (1) tremulous calls function akin to a rapid call rate, with each syllable of the cowbird's call eliciting a provisioning response equivalent to a single wren call, and thus that (2) cowbird calls exploit a provisioning rule common among birds; when we repeated our experiments in a species naive to parasitism, the great tit, Parus major, we found their responses closely resembled those of house wrens. Shiny cowbirds therefore show us an alternative route by which a parasite's begging call structure may be tailored to optimize host care. Aptly for a generalist, cowbird calls may well act as a highly effective stimulus of provisioning across a range of hosts whose own calls are structurally simpler.

AB Anthropogenic (man-made) noise is a global problem and present in virtually all terrestrial and aquatic environments. To date, most studies investigating the potential impact of this pollutant have focused on individual behavioural responses and simply considered whether noise has an effect. However, most animals engage in social interactions, which may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of noise, and work in other fields suggests that individuals might react differentially to comparable noise stimuli depending on their own characteristics and the current situation. We used controlled experiments and standardized tests to investigate the impacts of playback of the noise of a passing boat, a dominant acoustic stressor in the aquatic environment, on nest-digging behaviour, antipredator defence and social interactions in small groups of Neolamprologus pulcher, a territorial and cooperatively breeding cichlid fish. Our results show that, in comparison to ambient noise, playback of boat noise: (1) reduced digging behaviour, which is vital to maintain hiding and breeding shelters; (2) decreased defence against predators of eggs and fry, with direct consequences for fitness; and (3) increased the amount of aggression received and submission shown by subordinates. Moreover, the context (presence or absence of eggs) affected individual and social behaviours in response to the same noise source. Our results demonstrate the need to consider whole behavioural repertoires for a full understanding of the impact of anthropogenic noise, and indicate that the effects of this global pollutant are likely to be context dependent.

AB In 1980, Paul J. Greenwood published a review of dispersal in birds and mammals that has been widely cited. The review evaluated possible explanations for sex-biased natal dispersal. It concluded that female-biased dispersal occurred in socially monogamous birds because males were using territorial resources to attract mates. In mammals, polygynous and polygynandrous males compete directly for and defend groups of females, and thus males more often disperse to find opportunities to sequester such groups. Thus, the primary difference between birds and mammals in sex-bias of dispersal appeared to be one of resource defence and mate defence mating systems. What made this review so seminal and what is the fate of his research question today? I begin with the excitement of the 'sociobiology' revolution and the fundamental nature and importance of the topic of dispersal. Furthermore, as all living things disperse, the topic of dispersal is central to many fields of study in behaviour, ecology, conservation and evolutionary biology. The hypotheses to explain dispersal that Greenwood reviewed (competition for resources, competition for mates and inbreeding avoidance) have been augmented, primarily by interest in lowered local kin competition as a fitness advantage for dispersers and kin cooperation as a reason not to disperse (viz. to remain philopatric in or near the natal area, particularly for female mammals). Current studies of Greenwood's question about sex biases in dispersal focus on testing the effects of local kin competition and on phylogenetic comparisons that reveal evidence of independent evolution of alternative dispersal patterns.

AB The study of size-assortative mating, or homogamy, is of great importance in speciation and sexual selection. However, the proximate mechanisms that lead to such patterns are poorly understood. Homogamy is often thought to come from a directional preference for larger mates. However, many constraints affect mating preferences and understanding the causes of size assortment requires a precise evaluation of the pair formation mechanism. Mate-guarding crustaceans are a model group for the study of homogamy. Males guard females until moult and reproduction. They are also unable to hold a female during their own moult and tend to pair with females closer to moulting than them. Using a theoretical approach, we tested the potential for size-assortative mating to arise from such a state-dependent male decision rule. Consistent with previous experimental observations, we found a pattern of size assortment that strengthened with maleemale competition over females. This decision rule, which we call the female-sooner norm, may be a major cause of homogamy in mate-guarding crustaceans. This highlights the potential for size assortment to arise from preferences not based on body size. It emphasizes the importance of considering pair formation processes when studying the link between preference and pattern in order to avoid inferential fallacies.

AB Adult body size may reflect the availability of nutrients during the development of insects and often covaries with mate quality parameters influencing the outcome of both inter- and intrasexual selection. But large males are not necessarily advantaged in contests for mating partners, because smaller competitors may compensate for lesser physical strength by an increased mating agility. In mating systems involving sexual signalling before mating, body size might be a crucial parameter given that the signal strength depends on the availability of limited nutritional resources. In the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis, the male sex pheromone is produced from the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid. Here we tested the influence of body size on male sex pheromone titres and the outcome of male-male mating contests. We found that large males had significantly higher pheromone titres and released the sex attractant in higher amounts than small males. In an open arena bioassay, virgin females preferred pheromone doses adapted to the amounts released by large males. When directly competing for a female, however, large and small males had the same mating success. Hence, small N. vitripennis males, albeit equally successful in direct competition, are likely to be disadvantaged by being less attractive from a distance.

AB Forced copulation, which is perhaps the most extreme form of sexual conflict, is ubiquitous among many species including humans. To better understand the evolution and maintenance of forced copulations, it is imperative to assess their costs and benefits. We followed up on recent studies indicating frequent forced copulations in two wild populations of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, and quantified their effects on males and females under controlled laboratory settings. Compared to females that mated consensually, females that were forcibly mated had fewer progeny, higher mortality rates and higher frequencies of wing damage that prevented flight. Males that forcibly copulated fathered much fewer progeny than did males that mated consensually. The reasons for the relatively small reproductive gains to males from forced copulations were the lower female fertility and higher female mortality from forced than consensual copulations as well as the higher frequencies of rematings by females that were forcibly copulated. It is likely that males attempt to force-copulate in spite of the low potential reproductive gain because of the scarcity of sexually receptive females and the consequent low probability of attaining the high fitness associated with consensual matings.

AB Divergent diet menus could cause sympatric divergence of risk sensitivity; however, evidence is not yet available for the functional link between diet menu and risk sensitivity. We investigated risk sensitivity (measured as the discount intensity for probabilistic rewards) and diet menu (insectivory and granivory) among three sympatric species of tits (family Paridae): varied tits, Poecile varius, marsh tits, Poecile palustris, and great tits, Parus major, which form mixed-species foraging flocks in Japan. Binary choice tests, offering rewards of differing amount and probability, were conducted in the laboratory. Great tits and marsh tits were found to be risk prone (and more insectivorous), whereas varied tits were risk averse (and more granivorous). Diet menus were examined in the laboratory using behavioural titration tests between sunflower seeds and mealworms. The results of these tests were similar to patterns of food exploitation determined using stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15 contents) of blood samples from birds collected in the wild. Possibly, the dominant varied tits drove the other two species of tits towards different diet menus and unusually high risk proneness. In future, we should examine whether different interspecies interactions cause different risk sensitivity in other geographical environments.

AB Flexibility is considered a defining feature of great ape gestural communication. Previous research has suggested that there is a 'means-ends' dissociation between gesture type and context, whereby one signal may be used across contexts and several signals used within the same context. Such flexibility in signal production demands contextual comprehension, whereby recipients may perceive the context-free message of a given manual gesture, but also decide how to respond by inferring the signaller's goals from the accompanying context. We conducted naturalistic observations of wild East African chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, manual gestures, focusing on recipient perspective-during communicative interactions. Our results indicate that chimpanzees recognize the context-free meanings of gestures and they are also able to respond flexibly by inferring the meaning from the combination of gesture and context, including relative rank. When analysed at the level of gesture type, some gestures were tightly associated with dominant responses and outcomes. Chimpanzee manual gestures are primarily used for directing a recipient's movement or attention but the motivation underlying these gestural requests is inferred by the recipient from the context.

AB Joint laying, where multiple females contribute eggs to a single nest and provide parental care, is a rare breeding system in the avian world. Currently, little is understood about the fitness consequences that joint laying imposes on all members of a cooperatively breeding group, and this is necessary for understanding the evolution of this unusual breeding system. Here, we combine descriptive and experimental studies to understand the costs of joint laying in the pukeko, Porphyrio porphyrio melanotus. Our study shows when total clutch size is large (as a result of two females contributing eggs to a joint clutch), a lower percentage of eggs hatch. As a result, joint-laying females were reproductively compromised relative to females that nested singly. Given this apparent cost of joint laying, it is surprising that females tolerate the eggs of co-breeding females. Thus, in a follow-up study, we tested whether female pukeko restrain from ovicide to avoid the risk of retaliation by the co-breeding female (i.e. the peace incentive hypothesis). Females did not retaliate or cease parental care in response to experimental removal of their eggs from joint nests, and thus, we found no evidence to support the peace incentive hypothesis. However, we suggest that the risk of nest desertion, most likely initiated by male partners, may be an indirect cost preventing the evolution of ovicide. This threat of nest abandonment could force primary laying females to tolerate eggs laid by secondary females. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sex-biased dispersal is common in mammals, and in most species, the majority of dispersers are juvenile males. However, which sex typically disperses in a species will ultimately be determined by the costs and benefits of dispersal for each sex. These are partly determined by a species' mating system, with female-defence polygyny being strongly associated with male-biased dispersal. The few mammal species without sex-biased dispersal have been predicted to have a monogamous or polygynandrous mating system and levels of intraspecific competition that affect males and females equally. North American pikas may meet these criteria. Using microsatellite data from a decade of population monitoring, we examined the mating system and dispersal habits of the collared pika, Ochotona collaris, an asocial alpine-dwelling lagomorph. While their behaviour suggests they are monogamous or polygynous, parentage analyses revealed that the pikas were primarily polygynandrous. As predicted, there was no difference in the average distance dispersed by the two sexes, most likely because the costs and benefits of dispersal do not differ between males and females in this species. Since levels of inbreeding in the population were low, we also determined whether the pikas chose mates based on genetic dissimilarity, and whether they decreased the inbreeding coefficients of their offspring by going on forays to mate with animals other than their neighbours. Pikas did not restrict themselves to mating with their neighbours, but the average relatedness coefficients between pairs that produced offspring did not differ from the average relatedness coefficients expected under a model of random mate choice.

AB Herbivorous insects use information about volatile substances to select their host plants. The possibility that insects use these volatiles to assess the infection status of a host plant has rarely been tested. The assessment of host status via olfaction may allow a more successful allocation of time and energy towards the procurement of valuable resources for the offspring. We hypothesized that olfactory cues play a role in providing an herbivorous insect with information about the health status of a potential host plant. To test this hypothesis, we compared the attraction and oviposition response of the grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana, to healthy grapes, Vitis vinifera, with the response to grapes infected with a phytopathogenic fungus, Botrytis cinerea. The fungal infection elicited substantial reductions in both attraction from a distance and oviposition on the host. By preventing contact with the fruits, we found that volatiles from the infected grapes were the signal eliciting the observed behaviour. Experiments with a synthetic compound, 3-methyl-1-butanol, identified in the odour of infected grapes, confirmed the essential function of olfactory cues in this process, both in the laboratory and in the field. In our system, the avoidance of a diseased plant supported the preference performance hypothesis in L. botrana. Results are discussed in relation to the role of fungal volatiles in plant-insect relationships. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Caste polymorphism in termites may provide specialization for different tasks in a colony, generating a division of labour that promotes fitness. The influence of polymorphism has been widely studied for many termite activities, although general patterns are missing in the literature. The aim of our study was to verify the influence of polymorphism on the tunnelling behaviour of termites and to test how the size of workers influences the network geometry. We hypothesized that larger workers dig fewer and longer tunnels, while smaller workers dig shorter and more ramified tunnels. We tested this hypothesis by separating groups of polymorphic workers of Velocitermes heteropterus according to their size and analysing the topology of their networks. The workers of V. heteropterus were first examined to ensure their dimorphism and then sexed to confirm their sexual polymorphism. The analysis of the tunnel networks showed that major female workers dug faster but with less bifurcations compared to minor male workers. When both types of workers were placed together, the resulting network topology was closer to that of the majors, suggesting that this class may govern the activities during tunnelling. Our results show that worker size influences the network architecture and that, in the case of V. heteropterus, the majors dominate both digging and the bifurcation rate.

AB In socially monogamous mammals, male behaviour can have important consequences on production and survival of offspring. Therefore, females in these species could enhance their reproductive success by discriminating among potential male social partners and mates on the basis of phenotypic cues correlated with male fidelity and paternal behaviour. Prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, are socially monogamous rodents that typically form pair bonds and show extensive biparental care. In male prairie voles, variation in the length of microsatellite DNA in the regulatory region of the avpr1a gene encoding the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) underlies differences in V1aR neural expression and is correlated with significant differences in partner preference and paternal behaviour. Previous laboratory studies demonstrated that males possessing longer avpr1a microsatellite alleles spend more time with their female social partner, sire offspring with fewer females and provide more paternal care relative to males with shorter avpr1a microsatellite alleles. Our results from laboratory preference trials showed that female voles from populations in Illinois and Kansas displayed significant social and sexual preferences for males that possessed longer avpr1a microsatellite alleles. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that females are using phenotypic cues whose expression is correlated with a male's avpr1a microsatellite genotype to discriminate among potential mates. These social and sexual preferences for males with longer avpr1a microsatellite alleles may result in increased female reproductive success.

AB Sexual selection leads to the evolution of various traits that increase male fitness under male-male competition including sperm competition. In many taxa, bimodal distributions of copulation and/or intromission duration are known to be the result of adaptation to sperm competition risk avoidance. However, the stalk-eyed seed bug, Chauliops fallax Scott (Heteroptera: Malcidae), exhibits completely different mating behaviour to other known examples. The male mounts the female and then inserts his aedeagus repeatedly and intermittently until the termination of copulation. Insertion duration exhibited a bimodal distribution with two peaks: a short insertion within 6 min which occurred one to three times without insemination, followed by long insertions of approximately 30 min with repeated insemination. To examine the adaptive significance of the two types of genital insertion, we investigated whether the amount of sperm transferred, female remating receptivity, number of eggs laid, hatchability and female longevity differed between the two insertion types. Sperm transfer mainly occurred during long insertions but very little occurred during short insertions. Similarly, long insertions induced mated females to resist subsequent mating attempts of other males but short insertions did not. Short insertions did not affect the number of eggs laid, hatchability or female longevity. Although our results showed that C. fallax males transferred sperm to females and inhibited female remating with long insertions, we currently cannot explain the adaptive function of short insertions without insemination.

AB Search images are expected to be important components of predator and parasitoid search strategies as they reduce the search time for prey and hosts. Fixed search images, however, may constrain predators and parasitoids, and render them ineffective at switching to new more abundant prey or hosts. For switching behaviour to be effective, parasitoids need to be able to learn cues associated with abundant hosts, and they need to be able to extinguish preferences for the cues of hosts that are no longer abundant. Here we use the Gryllus cricket and Ormia ochracea parasitoid fly system to show (1) individual consistency in fly preference for song in the field, (2) learning of host song in the laboratory and (3) that the flies' memory for learned host cues is very short term. These results are interesting and novel in several respects. First, our demonstration that O. ochracea satisfies each of the characteristics of an optimally foraging temporary specialist is new. Second, this is only the third demonstration of learning in the Tachinidae, a family of more than 9000 species, all of which are parasitoids. Third, the flexibility inherent in learning and host switching may have been instrumental in allowing expansion of the fly's geographical and host range.

AB Passerine mobbing calls are, in part, addressed to conspecific and heterospecific prey individuals, and may encourage them to join a flock mobbing a predator. We examined whether conspecific and heterospecific individuals differ in their response to natural and manipulated contact and mobbing calls. We assumed that conspecifics would be more sensitive to slight variation in call elements and manipulations, whereas heterospecifics most likely cannot distinguish subtle differences. We used chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs, contact and mobbing calls, which differ only slightly in structure (start and maximum frequency and frequency bandwidth). Despite these subtle differences in call parameters, mobbing calls of chaffinches could be transformed into artificial contact calls by using fewer elements/min, and vice versa. Contact calls could be transformed into mobbing calls by reducing the pauses between the single elements. The results show that intense calling attracted more conspecific and heterospecific prey individuals than less intense playbacks of the calls made of the same elements. Responses to natural calls compared to manipulated calls were similar in minimum distance to the speaker in conspecifics and heterospecifics, in the number of conspecific and heterospecific individuals alerted and in the number of heterospecific species attracted. The frequency of calls per time unit was the most significant factor affecting whether other birds interpreted the vocalization as a mobbing or a contact call. In conspecifics, the effect sizes of the response were smaller, suggesting that conspecifics perceive the manipulation as conflicting information.

AB One of the most apparent examples of cooperation between unrelated individuals is biparental care whereby the male and the female parent share the rearing of the offspring. Theoretical models of care predict that selection should favour biparental care if it substantially improves the survival of the offspring. Although various ecological factors have been proposed to necessitate biparental care, experimental evidence is scant given the challenges of manipulating ecological factors in the natural habitat of animals. We carried out one such experiment in a small shorebird, the Kentish plover, Charadrius alexandrinus, that breeds in an extreme desert environment. Nest cover and thus exposure to solar radiation vary between nests, and we show that parents at exposed nests spent more time incubating than those at nests shaded by a bush (covered nests). Experimental removal and supplementation of nest cover gave results consistent with the observational data; at experimentally exposed nests both males and females increased incubation effort and relieved each other more frequently whereas at experimentally covered nests we observed the opposite. We conclude that exposure to extreme solar radiation influences biparental care and this necessitates parental cooperation in the Kentish plover. Furthermore, since parental care often coevolves with mating strategies, we conjecture that where the environment puts less pressure on the parents and provides the opportunity for reduced care, both mating systems and parental care can diversify over evolutionary time.

AB Object permanence is a component of physical cognition and refers to the knowledge that an object still exists when out of sight or displaced. Many animal species develop object permanence skills in a similar sequence as human infants, but few master the most complex aspects, such as representing invisibly displaced objects. We tested six developing, hand-raised carrion crows on Piagetian object permanence applying a randomized presentation of Uzgiris & Hunt's (1975, Assessment in Infancy: Ordinal Scales of Psychological Development, University of Illinois Press) Scale 1 tasks. In addition, the birds were tested on transpositions, visible and invisible rotational displacement tasks. The results from this longitudinal study demonstrate that young carrion crows did develop full Piagetian object permanence skills including Stage 6 (with the exception of task 15). This ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. Systematically different points in time at which same-aged crows mastered the tasks indicated interindividual cognitive differences. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called 'A-not-B error'). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. The overall pattern of the development and competence of object permanence in crows is similar to other corvid species. The absolute ages at which corvid species pass the tests seem to be a function of the hatching-to-fledging time. The findings may reflect maturing executive functions rather than being related to food-storing habits. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We examined how starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, adjust preferences to retrospective sunk costs in either time or work. Ideal decision-makers disregard sunk costs, but under some circumstances animals, like humans, prefer normally costlier rewards when they do not have to pay the costs. We argue that a possible explanation is state-dependent valuation learning (SDVL). The argument is that subjective value (hedonic state or fitness) is a decelerated function of energetic state, and energetic costs displace the subject's state towards conditions where the function is steeper and the subjective value of rewards is enhanced. We compared SDVL with within-trial contrast (WTC). WTC says that experiencing a food reward brings subjects to a baseline, constant, hedonic state, so that being in a more negative prereward mood causes a bigger positive displacement. SDVL focuses on energetic costs, while WTC focuses on any emotional dimension. We carried out three experiments that differed in the salience and dimension of the cost (time or work) and found overvaluation of costlier outcomes when the retrospective cost involved work (locomotory activity) but not when it involved only delays. When work was used as a cost, the effects of cost on preference showed strong stochastic transitivity. Our findings are consistent with studies in which energetic state was altered by deprivation rather than cost, and may help to explain why studies of WTC have had unreliable outcomes.

AB Individuals with reduced body mass resulting from early nutritional stress often compensate for this later in growth. This compensatory growth can be beneficial as individuals adjust their body mass to the level of individuals that grew up under better conditions. Yet, compensatory growth can also result in costs that are paid later in life. In zebra finches raised under different nutritional conditions, we tested whether compensatory growth affects subsequent adult exploratory behaviour, a proxy for an avian personality trait. We tested their exploratory behaviour in a spatial test to find hidden food on 2 consecutive days. The behavioural measures of exploration correlated with each other across time showing a high individual behavioural consistency. Early nutritional treatment itself did not affect exploration and feeding. Yet, birds with higher previous compensatory growth were less active and approached the food with different latencies from birds with lower compensatory growth. Life history decisions on whether to compensate for a bad start or stay small thus result in elementary differences in behaviour, such as exploratory behaviour, with potential fitness consequences, depending on payoffs of explorative strategies in different environmental conditions.

AB Mothers can modify the phenotype of their offspring both genetically and epigenetically, in response to the environment they experience. The role of maternal experience in affecting offspring clutch size is often difficult to measure, because parent-offspring conflict over this trait is common. In polyembryonic parasitoids, where each egg proliferates to form a clone of genetically identical siblings, the conflict is minimized. Therefore, they are good models for studying maternal effects on clutch size. In the haplodiploid parasitoid wasp Copidosoma koehleri, female clones contain more individuals than male clones. This may result from differences in genome size or in optimal body size between the sexes. Alternatively, maternal mating may mediate epigenetic physiological changes in eggs, leading to increased proliferation. We evaluated these hypotheses by comparing the body size and number of clone mates produced by mated versus virgin females. Sons of mated females were significantly smaller and formed larger clones than sons of virgins. Daughters formed the largest clones, but resembled sons of mated females in body size. Clone sizes of parents and offspring were not correlated. These findings suggest that both offspring sex and maternal experience (mating status) affect clone size, and that this trait's heritability is low. The increased proliferation by offspring of mated females may enhance paternal fitness by producing extra daughters, or benefit the offspring under conditions where the associated decrease in body size does not greatly reduce fitness. We estimated the contribution of large body size to male reproductive success through a mate choice assay. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nonrepairable body damage such as tooth and wing wear commonly occur in animals and can dramatically alter their behaviour. We critically examined the effects of nonrepairable damage in a model system that enabled us to separate the effects of damage from other correlated effects of senescence. Compared to sham controls, honeybees with 20% of their front wings trimmed continued to forage at similar rates and reduced their net rate of food delivery by approximately 20%. The changes in flight behaviour allowing the foragers to cope with the substantial wing damage probably occurred immediately following wing trimming. Bees showed no increase in foraging performance either in successive trips or during the 2 days following wing trimming. The cost of maintaining relatively high foraging performance after sustaining severe wing damage was approximately a 20% increase in mortality rate, most likely owing to predation. Our results illustrate a remarkable versatility of honeybees' flight behaviour, which allows them to handle the inevitable nonrepairable body damage that naturally occurs with ageing.

AB Contests between individuals over resources may be costly in terms of both time and energy expended and the risk of injury. Signals of status, or 'status badges', are thought to have evolved to minimize these costs by providing information about an individual's fighting ability or resource-holding potential (RHP) at the start of a contest. Studies on recently established North American populations of the paper wasp Polistes dominulus have demonstrated the existence of a status badge, in the form of black clypeal patterns, and have shown that rivals attend to these patterns during competitive interactions. However, observational data from studies in this wasp's native European range have failed to demonstrate a strong link between clypeal patterning and RHP. We undertook the first direct test of status signalling in a European population of P. dominulus, by testing receiver responses to clypeal pattern manipulations in a competitive foraging context. We found no evidence that individuals assessed rivals using the clypeal 'badge'. We discuss possible reasons for variation in signal use between the American and European populations, including genetic drift and environmental effects of the development and transmission of the signal.

AB Conflicts over reproduction are common in animal societies and are especially pronounced in groups of totipotent individuals. Nevertheless, most research is done on nontotipotent social hymenopterans (ants, some bees, wasps). In contrast, systematic studies on conflict in termites are largely lacking. We studied possible conflict over reproduction in the lower termite Cryptotermes secundus during replacement of the royal pair. Strong conflicts were predicted as all colony members (except soldiers) have the capability to become neotenic replacement reproductives. Our behavioural observations first implied that there was no overt conflict during replacement, but the killing of some neotenics suggested that conflict was not completely suppressed. Various mechanisms were found that may regulate conflict. Individuals had different behavioural profiles during the inheritance process, reflecting their potential to become a successful reproductive. Butting was confirmed as dominance behaviour when reproductives were absent: those individuals inheriting the breeding position butted more than their nestmates. Yet to become a successful breeder more qualities were required: replacement reproductives that stably inherited the breeding position fed nestmates more via proctodeal trophallaxis (anal feeding) than those that were killed. Our results are in line with longstanding physiological concepts of proctodeal trophallaxis acting to regulate development and a short sensitive developmental period that restricts the number of individuals capable at any given time of becoming replacement breeders. Both mechanisms have the potential to reduce conflicts within totipotent termite societies: the former by acting as an honest signal, the latter by a 'fair lottery' process.

AB Sex biases in parasite infestation are known for various host-parasite systems. In most cases, males of higher vertebrates are infested by more parasites than females. The mechanisms behind male-biased infestation may include not only more opportunities for males to encounter parasites and/or better performance of a parasite in male hosts but also active selection of these hosts by a parasite. To test this hypothesis, we studied behavioural responses of the flea Xenopsylla ramesis to males and females of its common rodent host Meriones crassus in Y-maze trials. We asked whether an individual flea is able to discriminate between male and female hosts and choose a male host, and whether previous experience of the fleas ( never fed, fed once on a male host, fed once on a female host) affects the choice. Among 385 fleas, 62% made a choice. In general, proportions of female fleas making or not making a choice of a rodent did not differ significantly, whereas the majority of male fleas chose a rodent. Latency of rodent choice was similar between male and female fleas, but was strongly affected by experience: fleas that previously fed on a male rodent or were never fed made their choices significantly faster than fleas previously fed on a female rodent. Among fleas that made a choice, selection of a male versus a female rodent depended on flea sex only. Male fleas chose randomly between a male and a female rodent, whereas female fleas chose a male rodent significantly more often than a female rodent. Our results suggest that male-biased flea infestation may involve active choices of male hosts by fleas. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Random walks have long been used to characterize animal movement patterns; recently, this practice has received renewed impetus via the application of Levy walk models. Whilst such models have produced encouraging results, the methods applied have been inconsistent and often problematic; furthermore, primates remain under-represented in such studies. This paper addresses both of these problems via the explanation of a novel and robust analytical method as applied to an extensive primate data set. In a study of a band of hamadryas baboons at the Filoha outpost of Awash National Park, Ethiopia from March 2005 to February 2006, the baboons' location was mapped every 15 min during all-day follows using a handheld GPS unit, yielding over 3000 step lengths and waiting times documented across 105 complete follows. Both power law and exponential models were fitted to the step length and waiting time data via maximum likelihood procedures within a model selection paradigm facilitated by the use of an information criterion to distinguish between models. Results show that the step lengths were exponentially distributed, and thus consistent with a random distribution of resources in space. Waiting times, however, were power law distributed, and thus consistent with a power law distribution of patch sizes. We evaluate these results within a discussion of the extent to which random search algorithms are applicable to animals with extensive knowledge of their habitats.

AB Bats are highly social and spend much of their lives echolocating in the presence of other bats. To reduce the effects of acoustic interferences from other bats' echolocation calls, we hypothesized that bats might shift the timing of their pulse emissions to minimize temporal overlap with another bat's echolocation pulses. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether free-tailed bats, Tadarida brasiliensis, echolocating in the laboratory would shift the timing of their own pulse emissions in response to regularly repeating artificial acoustic stimuli. Each bat tested showed a robust phase-locked temporal pattern in pulse emissions that included an initial suppressive phase lasting more than 60 ms after stimulus onset, during which the probability of emitting pulses was reduced by more than 50%, followed by a compensatory rebound phase, the timing and amplitude of which were dependent on the temporal pattern of the stimulus. The responses were nonadapting and were largely insensitive to broad changes in the acoustic properties of the stimulus. Randomly occurring noise bursts also suppressed calling for up to 60 ms, but the time course of the compensatory rebound phase was more rapid than when the bats were responding to regularly repeating patterns of noise bursts. These findings provide the first quantitative description of how external stimuli may cause echolocating bats to alter the timing of subsequent pulse emissions.

AB Signals increase the fitness of a sender by altering the behaviour of receivers. For cooperative interactions biological market theory proposes that signalling strength may be linked to supply and demand. In this context, a recent laboratory experiment demonstrated that cleaner shrimps may advertise their service to client reef fish and that the advertisement is linked to hunger levels. We investigated signalling by the cleaner shrimp Periclimenes longicarpus in the field to test more detailed predictions of biological market theory. Shrimps often clapped with their pair of claws in response to approaching clients. In line with both theory and the previous study, the probability of clapping increased when the shrimps had been food deprived and clapping shrimps were more likely to clean than nonclapping individuals. However, we found no evidence for the market theory prediction that signalling was targeted specifically to visiting client species with the option to choose other cleaning stations. Instead, shrimps signalled more frequently towards predatory clients than towards nonpredatory clients. We conclude that the signal does not serve primarily to attract the choosy clients but to convey information about identity as preconflict management to avoid predation.

AB Social and nonsocial organisms both require a suite of nutrients in correct amounts and ratios to promote growth and fitness, but the nutrient profiles of available foods are rarely optimal. Nutrient acquisition in insect societies is more complex compared to that of nonsocial organisms however, because foraging is restricted to only a proportion of the colony, and these members must satisfy their own nutritional requirements and those of other members having distinct nutritional needs. In this study we used laboratory colonies of the. re ant Solenopsis invicta to quantify how ants regulate their protein-carbohydrate intake when restricted to diets with different fixed protein-carbohydrate (p:c) ratios, and to quantify, at both the individual and colony level, behaviours and costs associated with nutrient regulation when feeding on these foods. We found that ants were most attracted to foods with equal or moderately protein-biased p:c ratios. However, colonies on these two treatments created large hoards, and the p:c ratios of these foods differed from that of collected food. In general, carbohydrates were extracted and protein was retained. As a result, carbohydrate intake on all diets except the extremely protein-biased diet was similar. However, carbohydrate regulation on diets with equal and moderately protein-biased p:c ratios may be costly through elevated worker activity and mortality, and through reduction of worker lipid reserves. For colonies feeding on heavily protein-biased food, energy production may have been achieved via gluconeogenesis. We discuss our results in relation to how dietary p:c imbalances in naturally encountered foods may be driving ant foraging behaviour in the field.

AB Pit-building antlion larvae are sit-and-wait predatory insects that construct conical pits, from which they ambush prey, in sandy soils. We examined the behavioural responses of antlions to the detection of various sized prey, which they were not allowed to capture. We found that antlions responded faster to smaller prey items, probably because larger prey may be considered a source of disturbance rather than a food source. Antlion response time to provided prey decreased after feeding and was negatively correlated with antlion body mass. Both of these results were indicative of a response to prey that depended on both internal and external factors. Pit dimensions increased with time at a constant rate among antlions in the unsuccessful prey capture or fed groups, but at a decelerating rate in the unfed control group. Contrary to our expectation, we could not detect differences in the rate of mass loss between antlions that were unfed and those experiencing unsuccessful prey captures. We also posited that antlions should exploit a specific prey type more efficiently as the number of encounters they had with it increased. However, there was no support for this prediction in our study. Exploring the responses of predators to prey in general, and in light of the conditions characterizing their natural habitat in particular, can improve our understanding of how predators adapt to cope with environmental variability.

AB The dominant theory for the evolution of male sexual ornaments is that they act as signals of male quality used by females in their mate choice. But these traits may also be used in male-male competition. In stalk-eyed flies, male eyespan (the distance between the eyes) is already known to play an important role in female mate choice. We investigated the influence of eyespan on male aggression over control of lek mating sites, both under controlled conditions and from field observations. Eyespan positively affected the number of aggressive encounters between two males on a lek. There were more aggressive interactions between large-eyespan males compared with small-eyespan males, and large-eyespan males won proportionately more aggressive interactions. Lek site ownership also influenced the outcome of aggression but to a smaller degree than eyespan. In addition, higher resource value, the number of females on a lek, increased the chance of aggression. The outcome of aggression between males is the control of lek aggregation sites, and this had direct consequences for male reproductive success, as lek owners gained more matings at both dusk and dawn. The importance of male-male competition in shaping sexual selection in stalk-eyed flies is discussed. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Theoretical models have extended the Ideal Free Distribution model to examine predator-prey systems having three trophic levels, when both predator and prey are allowed to move freely. One consistent prediction made by such models is that the spatial distribution of prey should be mainly determined by the inherent habitat riskiness ( e. g. cover level), with prey avoiding the inherently riskier habitats regardless ( or nearly so) of resource distribution. To test this prediction, we conducted laboratory experiments in which both predators (creek chub, Semotilus atromaculatus) and prey ( northern redbelly dace, Phoxinus eos) were free to move between feeding patches differing in resource quantity and habitat riskiness. When alone, creek chub and northern redbelly dace both preferred the more food-rich patch. The spatial distribution of dace was also inversely related to that of creek chub in the presence of chub fenced into feeding patches. When the patches differed in both riskiness and resource quantity, the spatial distribution of dace was mainly influenced by resource distribution and, to a lesser extent, by the inherent habitat riskiness in the absence of predators. In the presence of creek chub, the dace significantly decreased their use of the inherently riskier patch compared to when predators were absent. However, contrary to the models' prediction, food distribution still significantly influenced dace distribution when predators were present. Finally, dace aggregated increasingly in a third, totally safe area ( but one offering no food) as the number of chub present in both patches increased. Thus, the influence of resource distribution and inherent habitat riskiness on prey distribution seems to vary with the level of predation risk.

AB Extrapair paternity (EPP) is common in many socially monogamous species, influencing patterns of sexual selection and shaping many aspects of reproductive behaviour. However, factors explaining variation in the occurrence of EPP, both within and between populations, remain poorly understood. One ecological factor that has received considerable attention is breeding synchrony, but the proposed mechanisms remain contentious and the findings from the large number of correlational studies have been inconsistent. Mate guarding, a behavioural tactic to limit paternity loss, may be fundamental to any relationship between EPP and breeding synchrony. However, few studies have investigated how guarding behaviour varies with breeding synchrony, and the theoretical predictions are unclear. We examined how mate-guarding intensity in the colonial fairy martin varied with changes in breeding synchrony. To eliminate likely confounding effects of individual quality, we measured guarding intensity on multiple days during the fertile period of individual females and related this to daily variation in colony-level breeding synchrony. Similarly, we examined whether extrapair interest in fertile females varied with change in breeding synchrony. Both mate-guarding intensity and extrapair pursuit rate increased sharply several days prior to egg laying, before declining once laying commenced. When we controlled for this effect of female fertility status, guarding intensity increased with breeding synchrony. These novel findings suggest that the risk of paternity loss increases with breeding synchrony, at least among colonial species. Moreover, adjustment of guarding intensity to the risk of paternity loss may explain why most correlational studies do not reveal a relationship between EPP and breeding synchrony.

AB Many animal groups respond collectively to environmental cues. To understand the function of collective behaviour, an important first step is to establish how it varies in response to differences in the relevant cues. Because collective action arises from individual decisions, this in turn requires characterizing the behaviour of individual group members. In the treehopper Umbonia crassicornis, offspring live in cylindrical aggregations along a host plant stem. In the presence of a predator, offspring produce synchronized vibrational signals that elicit maternal defence. Predators typically attack the ends of the aggregation; because the mother must approach the predator to defend her offspring, we hypothesized that variation in collective signals reveals not only the predator's presence, but also its location. The defending mother also produces signals, and we hypothesized that maternal cues influence the signalling behaviour of the brood. We simulated predation at either end of the aggregation. In the presence of the mother, ( 1) offspring closer to the predator were more likely to signal and ( 2) more offspring contributed to the group signals when the predator attacked the aggregation at the far end from the mother. Differences in group signals, emerging from position-dependent differences in signalling probability of individual offspring, could be used by the defending mother to determine the end of the aggregation being attacked. A loss of these signalling patterns in the absence of the mother reveals that maternal cues are necessary for the establishment of a reliable relationship between collective signalling and predator location.

AB To examine potential effects of male-female interactions on the sexes' foraging behaviour, we studied equal-sized, single-and mixed-sex groups of a benthic elasmobranch, the small-spotted catshark, in response to electric stimuli. A total of 88 size-matched, adult individuals were repeatedly presented with a range of artificial, prey type electric fields (E fields) under laboratory conditions in groups of (1) four males, (2) four females and (3) two of each sex. Females in single-sex groups were more responsive towards E fields than both single-and mixed-sex group males, despite showing similar activity levels. Equally, females in mixed-sex groups were more responsive than males in mixed groups, but showed similar activity levels. Furthermore, females in mixed-sex groups were less responsive to E fields than females from single-sex groups, despite showing similar activity levels. Males in mixed-sex groups were less responsive than males in single-sex groups, but were more active. These results indicate more intense foraging behaviour among females than males and significant reductions in foraging behaviour when grouped with the opposite sex. Both findings are probably associated with consequences of differing reproductive strategies and resultant sexual conflict (specifically male harassment and female avoidance).

AB Researchers studying animal societies often begin by testing whether a population shows nonrandom social structure, by comparing observed social associations with the predictions of a null model. Association data comprises observations of individuals in groups, which are observed through repeated surveys. Each survey is conducted on a discrete occasion, for example, within 1 day or 1 week. Current null models randomize the interactions among individuals, while preserving two key elements of the data: the number of times that each individual has been seen, and the sizes of observed groups. A critical assumption of existing permutation methods is that each observed group is independent. However, this assumption is often violated. Typically, researchers search a large study area, relative to the distances moved by animals within the sampling occasion. Thus, most individuals will not have had opportunity to change their group associations during a sampling occasion. We show how randomization tests should be modified to account for this nonindependence of group membership. We generated association data sets in which we randomly assigned individuals to groups. We tested these data sets for nonrandom structure using the generally accepted 'trial swap' algorithm. We found that spurious conclusions of nonrandom structure occur when we allowed permutation of individuals across sampling occasions, but not when we 'blocked' the data by sampling occasion, and constrained our randomizations to permute individuals only among groups within each block.

AB Juveniles of many avian species possess spotted or mottled plumage that is distinct from the plumage of adults. Such plumage has typically been assumed to aid in camouflaging vulnerable immature birds. Here, we propose that spotty plumage signals juvenile status, thereby decreasing aggression from territorial adults. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the aggressive responses of adult eastern bluebird males to different combinations of simultaneously presented taxidermic mounts. We found that territorial males attacked adult models significantly more than juvenile models, and that they attacked adult models with orange breasts (typical of adults) more frequently than they attacked adult models with spotty breasts (typical of juveniles). We found no difference in attack rates when models with white breasts (a novel trait) were presented with models possessing spotty breasts. These observations indicate that breast colour is a cue used by territorial adults when identifying conspecific intruders, but that adults do not recognize juvenile-specific plumage as such. Adults respond aggressively only to orange-breasted intruders. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Age-related differences in the reproductive success of birds may be the result of experience-dependent changes in foraging and parental skills. We tested this hypothesis in a long-lived seabird, the common tern, Sterna hirundo. Transponder-marked birds were observed while feeding their young (1) as first-time breeders (recruits) and (2) as experienced breeders in 2 consecutive years in a breeding colony at Port Wilhelmshaven, Lower Saxony, Germany. The influence of individual breeding experience on feeding rate, feeding success and food composition was investigated, including potential year effects, using multivariate statistics. In addition, we compared the breeding success of experienced and inexperienced breeders. Feeding rate was not linked to experience, whereas experienced breeders had a higher feeding success than recruits. Both experienced breeders and recruits fed their young with the same prey species, but in recruits the proportion of prey items with low energy content was higher. The latter was linked to a lower breeding success of recruits. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to document an individual improvement in breeding performance as a reason for age-dependent improvement in reproductive success in birds after recruitment.

AB Understanding the benefits of cooperative breeding for group members of different social and demographic classes requires knowledge of their reproductive partitioning and genetic relatedness. During 2004-2007, we examined parentage as a function of relatedness and social interactions among members of 21 American crow, Corvus brachyrhynchos, family groups. Paired female breeders monopolized maternity of all offspring in their broods, whereas paired male breeders sired 82.7% of offspring, within-group auxiliary males sired 6.9% of offspring and extragroup males sired 10.4% of offspring. Although adult females had fewer opportunities for direct reproduction as auxiliaries than males, they appeared to have earlier opportunities for independent breeding. These different opportunities for direct reproduction probably contributed to the male-biased adult auxiliary sex ratio. Patterns of reproductive partitioning and conflict among males were most consistent with a synthetic reproductive skew model, in which auxiliaries struggled with breeders for a limited reproductive share, beyond which breeders could evict them. Counter to a frequent assumption of reproductive skew models, female breeders appeared to influence paternity, although their interests might have agreed with the interests of their paired males. Unusual among cooperative breeders, close inbreeding and incest occurred in this population. Incest avoidance between potential breeders did not significantly affect reproductive skew.

AB We present both an empirical study and a behavioural game model exploring a predator-prey game between white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, and Cape fur seals, Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus, around a small island colony in South Africa. Behavioural tactics used by adult seals appear to account for the variance in risk from sharks, while shark tactics seem more influenced by the behaviour of pup seals, probably because pup seals engage in riskier behaviours. A dynamic game model of the interaction predicts that, if pups and adult seals account for risk in a similar manner, then tactic selection used by sharks and seals should be more evenly distributed across all possible options. Instead, a second model in which pups were constrained to choose the riskiest option produced evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) solutions for both species that more closely approximated the tactics recorded, suggesting that behavioural variation within subgroups of a population should be accounted for when modelling predator-prey interactions. These results also suggest that pups may act as initiators in a behaviourally mediated indirect interaction with adult seals, mediated by the behaviour of their common shark predator; this would represent the first record of an intergenerational two-species indirect interaction.

AB Avian incubation behaviour is thought to be influenced mainly by ambient temperature and food availability. Field studies, however, have generated contradictory results; there is little agreement about the relative importance of food and temperature and how different components of incubation behaviour are affected by them. To date, no studies have manipulated both food availability and nest temperature in a controlled experiment, making it impossible to assess any potential interaction between food and temperature. We experimentally increased both food availability and ambient temperature during incubation in the northern mockingbird. Our results show that both food availability and temperature influence incubation behaviour. Increasing food availability enabled females to spend more time on the nest and in self- maintenance activities when off the nest. Increasing nest temperature caused females to spend less time incubating and to make more trips to and from the nest. When both food and temperature were increased, their effects on incubation time offset each other. These changes in incubation patterns had little effect on fitness, although embryo mass was lowest in the treatment in which only heat was increased, suggesting that heat may stress embryos, but not when extra food is also provided. Perhaps the reason previous studies have yielded contradictory results is that food and temperature offset each other in complex ways that could obscure their individual effects. Indeed, our experiment shows that food and temperature both affect avian incubation behaviour, but that different trade- offs apply to each environmental factor.

AB 'Pay to stay' is a mechanism generating cooperation in some highly social vertebrates. However, it is unknown which behaviours subordinate helpers preferentially use to pay for the commodities provided by resource owners. Helpers could either provide 'cheap' service to save costs or trade expensive actions for the benefit of being tolerated. In the cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, unrelated helpers pay to stay in a safe territory of dominant breeders by performing a range of behaviours including direct brood care, territory maintenance and defence. We investigated which behaviours helpers differing in size and sex showed in response to increased demands. By presenting high or low perceived intruder pressure we tested (1) whether helpers adjust their level of payment to the intensity of competition, (2) which behaviours are used for payment, and (3) whether the response to the treatment differs between helper size and sex. All helpers performed more defence behaviour in the high-density situation and large helpers put significantly more effort into digging and defence than small helpers did in both treatments. In the low-density treatment, large helpers reacted to breeder aggression by increased submissiveness, whereas in the high-density treatment they responded by increased territory defence, as predicted by the pay-to-stay hypothesis. Helper sex did not influence their behavioural responses. Our results suggest that helpers respond to demand and large helpers pay generally more than small ones to remain tolerated in the breeders' territory.

AB We investigated the behavioural mechanism underlying the recently discovered latitudinal variation in the social structure of the spider Anelosimus studiosus through population censuses, behavioural interaction trials, reciprocal nest transplants to different temperature environments and breeding experiments. Nest censuses completed at replicated sites at 2 degrees changes in latitude between south Florida (26 degrees) and east Tennessee (36 degrees) indicated that the dominant social structure is a solitary female nest. Multifemale nests consisting of cooperative females and their young first appeared in the populations at 30 degrees latitude and increased in frequency of representation with further increases in latitude as did number of females within multifemale nests. Interaction trials showed that communication and physical contact underlie the two social structures. Females from solitary female nests and F1 offspring reared in the laboratory demanded space (asocial phenotype), whereas individuals of multifemale nest origin (from same and foreign nests) were attracted to one another (social phenotype). Field experiments further showed that (1) individuals that dispersed from multifemale nests dispersed shorter distances and (2) nest coalescence was observed only at the higher latitudes, coincident with the presence of multifemale nests. Habitat transplants suggested that the behaviour underlying social structure is not plastic in this system, and breeding experiments eliminated a cryptic species alternative to the presence of different social structure phenotypes. Although both asocial and social phenotypes were present at all latitudes, the frequency of the social phenotype was rare at lower latitudes.

AB Teaching has long been a neglected area in animal behaviour, despite its relevance for a wide range of topics. In light of recent evidence for teaching in nonhuman animals, research can begin to examine the conditions under which it may evolve. Here, we make the case for an evolutionary perspective that treats teaching as a form of cooperative behaviour which functions to promote learning in others. We outline its key characteristics and discuss the selection pressures that may favour its evolution. Teaching will be favoured by selection only where the costs to teachers of facilitating learning are outweighed by the long-term fitness benefits they accrue once pupils have learned, and these benefits will be scaled by the ease with which pupils could learn without teaching. This perspective allows us to make predictions as to the distribution of teaching, the forms it may take, and the relation between teaching in humans and other species. We conclude by considering how teaching may best be categorized. We suggest that natural selection is likely to favour different forms of teaching, depending on whether it serves to promote learning of procedural or declarative information.

AB Group foragers can use a 'producer' tactic which involves searching for food or a 'scrounger' tactic which involves joining others who have discovered food. While these alternative behaviours are well documented, it is not clear to what extent an individual's tendency to forage independently or to follow others is under genetic control or rather is affected by experience. To examine whether hand-reared juveniles can learn to prefer using a producer or a scrounger tactic, we hand-reared house sparrow, Passer domesticus, nestlings that upon. edging were assigned to one of two training groups; the first was expected to enhance joining ( scrounging) behaviour and the second to enhance searching ( producing) behaviour. In the first group, fledglings were imprinted on a parent model ( stuffed female sparrow) that visited locations containing food. In the second group,fledglings were imprinted on a parent model that visited locations containing no food, while food was available in different locations. At the end of a 5-day training phase, all fledglings were released into a shared aviary, and their social foraging tendencies were measured. We found that fledglings from the first group used significantly more joining behaviour than fledglings from the second group, suggesting that an individual whose early experience positively reinforced joining behaviour is more likely to later become a joiner. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence for the effect of learning on the choice between social foraging strategies in the context of the producere scrounger game.

AB Group-living primates and other animals use postaggression ( PA) behavioural strategies to reduce the social costs of aggression. However, the relative frequency with which individuals use these conflict management strategies is unclear in many species, and functional analyses of these behaviours are rare. We observed aggression by dominant individuals against group members in cooperatively breeding meerkats, Suricata suricatta, and examined the incidents and effects of PA affiliation between the opponents ( reconciliation), avoidance and submission. Aggression had a negative effect on the social relationship between opponents because of an elevated probability of aggression occurrence and an increased time interval until the first nonagonistic PA encounter compared to nonagonistic ( control) encounters. The probability of aggression reoccurrence did not decrease with increasing time interval until the first PA encounter, indicating that aggression had long-lasting negative effects on social relationships. Evidence of reconciliation following aggression was not confirmed in this species. Avoidance and submission by the victim characterized the social behaviour following aggression. Although avoidance by victims in the first PA encounter reduced the probability of aggression reoccurrence, submission during aggression neither reduced the probability of aggression reoccurrence nor shortened the time interval until the first PA encounter. These results suggest that avoidance is the only behavioural option for victims of aggression to deal with PA hostility. Reconciliation and other forms of conflict management may be more important in species with low reproductive skew and with opportunities for negotiating relationships between group members than in despotic singular cooperative breeders.

AB The relationship between visual and vocal attractiveness in males and females as evaluated by men and women was investigated. Participants rated the attractiveness of voices and static faces or voices and moving faces. Rubenstein (2005. Psychological Science, 16, 759-762) suggested that dynamic and static faces are judged by different evaluative standards. Results from the reported experiment suggest that for male participants there was a positive correlation between female vocal and visual (moving or static face) attractiveness. Women rated with higher voice attractiveness were rated as having more attractive faces for female participants there was a positive correlation between male vocal and moving visual attractiveness but not between male vocal and static visual attractiveness. In addition, no significant correlation between the attractiveness of male static faces and that of male moving faces was found, highlighting differences in rated attractiveness when judging either moving or static faces (Rubenstein, A. J. 2005. Psychological Science, 16, 759-762) finally, there was no correlation between vocal and visual attractiveness (moving or static) for same-sex judgements. Results are discussed with regard to perceptual and evolutionary perspectives. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Unpalatable insects often advertise their defences to predators using conspicuous colours, such as red and yellow. Perhaps not surprisingly, birds show unlearned biases against warningly coloured food. These biases are particularly evident when other components of insect warning displays, such as sounds and odours, are also present. Quinine, a bitter-tasting toxic chemical, can also enhance unlearned biases against red and yellow prey in naive birds. However, whether this behaviour is performed specifically in response to quinine (which is chemically similar to many insect toxins) or can be elicited by other bitter-tasting chemicals is not known. The aim of our experiments was two fold. First, we investigated whether Bitrex, a bitter-tasting, nontoxic, man-made chemical, elicits colour biases similar to those elicited by quinine. Second, since avoidance learning can be affected by the number of bitter chemicals present in a prey population, we investigated whether the presence of both quinine and Bitrex enhanced unlearned biases against red crumbs compared to either chemical alone. We found that only quinine elicited attack biases against red prey, and there was no evidence that quinine and Bitrex in combination produced a stronger bias against red crumbs than quinine alone. These results indicate that colour biases incited by defence chemicals are chemical specific and may occur only in response to natural or toxic chemicals.

AB Geographical acoustic signal divergence in fish has been virtually unexplored. Minnows in the genus Cyprinella produce agonistic and courtship sounds during the spawning season, and Cyprinella galactura, with a disjunct distribution in the Ozark and Appalachian mountains, provided a good model for examining signal divergence. We found significant amounts of geographical variation between the four populations of C. galactura examined, and pulse signal parameters (pulse rate, pulse duration, pulse interval) were most important in distinguishing between the populations. Courtship signals differed from agonistic signals, with courtship signals less variable and more stereotyped. Adjacent populations from the Ozark Mountains were more similar than nonadjacent populations. Signal divergence in agonistic signals appears more random, with adjacent populations clustering with nonadjacent populations. Genetic drift may play a role in agonistic signal divergence, while geographical isolation may be responsible for courtship signal divergence.

AB Recent studies on mate-quality recognition in passerines showed that females use subtle differences in sound production to assess males. We analysed long calls of brown skuas, Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi, to test whether vocal performance could serve as an indicator of individual quality in a nonpasserine species. Measurements of vocal performances focused on two acoustic parameters for which motor constraints have been reported in passerines, namely 'vocal deviation' and 'peak performance'. As potential indicators of individual quality we measured body size, body condition ( body mass corrected for size) and mean reproductive success. We found a triangular distribution of calls between note repetition rate and frequency bandwidth. Males performing long calls closer to the performance limit had a higher mean reproductive success than males that show long calls with a larger vocal deviation. Similarly, males calling with a high peak performance were more successful breeders than males with low peak performance. Our findings indicate that long calls of brown skuas are limited by motor constraints similar to vocalizations in passerines. We show that differences in vocal performance reflect male's reproductive success with more successful breeders producing the more difficult calls. This implies that limits on vocal performance due to motor constraints present a suitable mechanism for mate-quality recognition in nonpasserine birds.

AB Among anuran amphibians evidence for chemical communication is scarce. We carried out three experiments to evaluate whether chemosignals influence the sexual behaviour of an Australian terrestrial toadlet, Pseudophryne bibronii. Substrate choice trials (experiment 1) revealed that females preferred to associate with substrate marked by either sex rather than an unmarked substrate and that males preferred substrate marked by females, but avoided substrate marked by other males. These results suggest that the odour of both sexes functions as a sexual attractant and that male odour may also function to repel potential male competitors. In experiment 2 we assessed whether females use male chemosignals during mate location by making gravid females navigate a two-choice Y-maze to reach calling males. Almost invariably, females followed a path outlined with male gland secretions. This result indicates that male chemosignals combined with acoustic signals improve the ability of females to find nest sites. In experiment 3 we tested whether conspecific odour influences the calling behaviour of nesting males. Female odour stimulated a twofold increase in advertisement calling and male odour stimulated a switch to territorial calling. These findings indicate that nesting males use conspecific odour as a cue for regulating investment in acoustic courtship and territory defence. Our results advance a small body of evidence to suggest that anurans use chemosignals to identify and locate potential mates and provide the first demonstration that odour can influence anuran calling behaviour.

AB Prey species possess numerous strategies to reduce predation. One tactic is to respond with antipredator behaviours when conspecific alarm cues are detected. The sea hare Aplysia californica defends itself from predators in many ways, one of which is releasing ink and opaline upon attack. Previous work showed that a mixture of ink and opaline from A. californica causes conspecifics to respond with antipredator behaviours such as moving away and/or 'galloping'. We examined the specificity of the alarm response, including identifying the molecules mediating it. Either ink or opaline alone evokes the full alarm response, but conspecific mucus, conspecific haemolymph, odour from predatory spiny lobsters, or odour from algal food do not. Thus, the defensive secretions, ink and opaline, specifically act as alarm cues to nearby conspecifics. We isolated and identified the alarm cues in ink as the base uracil and the nucleosides uridine and cytidine. Each of these molecules individually elicits frequencies of alarm behaviours as great as ink, Ink without its alarm cue molecules does not elicit a significant frequency of alarm behaviours. Thus, these three molecules together are necessary and sufficient to produce alarm responses. Aplysia californica antipredator behaviours are also elicited by ink from the congener Aplysia juliana or Aplysia dactylomela. Furthermore, ink from the squid Lolliguncula brevis or the octopus Octopus bimaculoides also elicits antipredator behaviours by A. californica, owing to the presence of uracil and uridine. Thus, these alarm cues may be common among inking molluscs. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Avian predators learn to avoid defended insects on the basis of their conspicuous warning coloration. In many aposematic species, the level of chemical defence varies, with some individuals (automodels) being more defended than others (automimics). Production of defence chemicals is often costly, and automimics enjoy the benefits of the warning signal without paying the cost of chemical production. This is a problem for the evolutionary stability of aposematism, since automimics appear to be at a selective advantage. If predators sample aposematic prey and selectively reject automodels, aposematism could become evolutionarily stable. However, it is then unclear how automimicry persists in aposematic species. Using chicks as predators and coloured crumbs for prey, we investigated how birds selectively rejected aposematic prey at different automimic frequencies. We found that birds tasted and rejected automodels at a constant level regardless of automimic frequency, but the rejection rates of automimics decreased with increasing automimic frequency. Birds only discriminated between automodels and automimics at frequencies above 25%; below this automimics would be at a selective advantage over automodels since they do not pay the costs associated with toxicity. Selective rejection of aposematic prey by predators can therefore explain both why aposematism is evolutionarily stable, and how automimicry can persist in aposematic populations. We also found that birds relearned that red crumbs were palatable more quickly with increasing automimic frequency. Therefore, the benefit of automimicry may depend upon birds' previous experiences with unpalatable prey as well as the actual frequency of automimics in the population.

AB In cooperatively breeding vertebrate societies, male and female helpers commonly vary in how much they invest in cooperative activities. Most explanations for this phenomenon centre on sex differences in the fitness benefits that helpers accrue through providing care, and few studies have explored how sex differences in the costs of helping are likely to influence how much care males and females provide. I investigated helper contributions in the banded mongoose, Mungos mungo, and asked whether differences in the way that helping trades off against male and female reproductive success can explain sex biases in helping effort. Contributions to the two main pup care activities were strongly male biased, and helping resulted in both sexes losing weight in the short term. This weight loss is unlikely to reduce the breeding success of males, as, although heavy males are more likely to gain access to oestrous females, any weight lost through helping can be regained before the next oestrous event. Furthermore, males less than 2 years old rarely gain access to oestrous females regardless of their body weight. Short-term reductions in body weight are likely to be more costly for females as the helping period coincides with conception and gestation of the next litter, and weight loss at this time is likely to reduce their probability of breeding successfully. These results suggest that male-biased care in this species has arisen because males and females differ in the way that helping trades off against their reproductive success.

AB Recently emerged brook charr foraging in still-water pools along the sides of streams tend to be either sedentary, feeding from the lower portion of the water column ( a sit- and- wait tactic) near the stream bank, or very active, feeding from the upper portion of the water column ( an active search tactic) away from the bank. We tested whether the search tactics used by charr in the field represent behavioural syndromes related to activity and space use. After quantifying the behaviour of fish in the field, focal individuals were captured and their behaviour quantified in novel environment experiments in the laboratory. In an aquarium, individuals that used an active search tactic in the. field spent a higher proportion of time moving, spent less time near the aquarium bottom, and took less time to find their way out of an erect glass jar, on average, than did individuals that used a sit- and- wait tactic in the field. When presented with near-bank and open-water conditions over 6 days in the laboratory, individuals that used an active search tactic in the field remained active and altered their activity less, on average, than individuals that used a sit- and- wait tactic in the field. Immediate responses to a pebble dropped in the aquarium (simulated risk from above) were not correlated with field behaviour. The search tactics used by brook charr in the field reflect part of a behavioural syndrome related to general activity and space use, but not to startle responses. These initial, individual differences in behaviour provide important raw material for the initial stages of resource polymorphism.

AB Animals that communicate acoustically in noisy social environments face the problem of perceptually segregating behaviourally relevant signals from background noise. Studies of humans indicate improvements in speech perception tasks when target speech and a masking noise with the frequency spectrum of speech come from different locations. Thus for humans, spatial release from masking is an important mechanism of sound source segregation that functions in acoustic communication in noisy, real- world environments. Little previous work has investigated the mechanisms of sound source segregation in nonhuman animals that rely on acoustic signalling. I investigated spatial release from masking in the grey treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis. Grey treefrogs form large breeding aggregations in which males produce loud advertisement calls that are necessary and sufficient for species recognition, source localization and selective mate choice by females. I tested the hypothesis that females would experience a release from masking when a synthetic advertisement call ( target signal) and an artificial noise with the spectrum of a grey treefrog chorus ( masker) were spatially separated. Using a phonotaxis paradigm, I assessed females' responses to the target signal at four signal- to- noise ratios ( SNR) and two angular separations. Female responsiveness to the target signal increased as the SNR increased from - 12 dB to +6 dB. More important, phonotaxis responses were faster at a 90 degrees angle of signal-masker separation compared to one of just 7.5 degrees. These results support the hypothesis that spatial release from masking is a potentially important mechanism for sound source segregation in animal acoustic communication.

AB We examined the extent to which female capuchin monkeys show an ` aversion to inequitable work effort' by providing the monkeys with the opportunity to engage in token exchange tasks to earn either a preferred ( grape) or nonpreferred ( oat cereal) food item. In experiment 1, monkeys were paired with partners such that both were required to exchange a token ( work effort) for either a preferred or nonpreferred food reward. The subject's exchange behaviour was then compared to conditions in which the partner received the food reward for no work effort. We found no evidence that differential work effort influenced the percentage of incomplete exchanges. Furthermore, capuchins completed exchanges more rapidly for the preferred food item, regardless of the work effort of the partner. In experiment 2, we evaluated, in the absence of differential work effort, behavioural responses of monkeys to receipt of a preferred or nonpreferred food in conditions where their partner received either the same or different food. These conditions were compared to control conditions where either the same or different food was placed in an adjacent empty cage. Capuchins were less likely to accept nonpreferred food and consumed it more slowly than preferred food. We found no evidence that the presence of a partner influenced acceptance or consumption of the nonpreferred food under inequitable conditions. Overall, we found no indication that capuchins are able to evaluate either the relative work effort of a partner or the inequity of a food reward and are thus unlikely to possess an ` aversion to inequity'.

AB We tested the hypothesis that experience of moving out of sight of an imprinting stimulus during a period of right hemispheric dominance ( 11 days of age), but not during a period of left hemispheric dominance ( 8 days of age), biases attention to distal spatial cues. Domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, were trained to locate a hidden imprinting object behind one of two differently marked screens placed at either end of a rectangular arena, and then presented with five unrewarded probe tests with the arena rotated by 180 degrees . Chicks that had experience of going behind opaque screens on day 11 chose the screen in the same direction as during training ( i. e. using distal cues) significantly more often than chicks given experience with opaque screens on day 8 or chicks provided with two transparent screens on either of these 2 days. We conclude that the similarities between behaviour patterns of chicks in the laboratory and in seminatural environments suggest that moving out of sight of the mother at 11 days of age is an ecologically important behavioural pattern that requires dominance by the right hemisphere to shift the chick's response to distal spatial information for locating a hidden goal.

AB To show context appropriate antipredator behaviour, animals require information about a predator's motivation to hunt, and consequently the level of danger to which they are exposed at any given moment. In addition to deterring a predator, mobbing behaviour, in which animals approach a potential predator, might also provide information useful in predation risk assessment. Here we present the results of an experimental study on meerkats, Suricata suricatta, which showed mobbing behaviour in a variety of predator contexts. Groups were presented with a number of predators of varying threat levels, and with non-threatening animals. Responses to these stimuli by the different individuals in the groups, and vigilance behaviour before and after each presentation, were compared. Meerkats seemed to use mobbing not only to deter predators, but also to gather information about potential threats and adjust their behaviour accordingly. In particular, mobbing of nondangerous animals indicates the role of this behaviour in contexts other than just directed towards predators. Differences between age categories suggest that mobbing changes with experience, and may allow young to learn about predators by observing adults. We conclude that mobbing has a broader function beyond predator deterrence, and facilitates situational risk assessment on which subsequent decisions may be based.

AB Our understanding of how, why, and the circumstances under which animals use social information has been facilitated by three principal areas of research, social learning, public information use and social eavesdropping. With few exceptions, these related concepts have remained remarkably distinct within the literature, with little discussion or integration among them. Are these distinctions warranted? We tackle the issue by exploring similarities and differences between the concepts with respect to how animals gather and use social information, the type of information gathered, how information is packaged, and the relative payoffs to individuals involved. We contend that none of the currently dominant paradigms, social learning, public information use, or social eavesdropping, provide a unifying theme for studying social information use. Instead, we favour the central characteristic of the three concepts, social information use, as the overarching umbrella, and advocate a broader conceptual framework for understanding more comprehensively how animals behave with their social environments. Our intention is not to revolutionize the fields of social learning, public information use or social eavesdropping, but rather to stimulate discussion among researchers investigating the abilities of animals to extract information from the social environment.

AB Bird song learning is a major model system for the study of learning with many parallels to human language development. In this experiment we examined a critical but poorly understood aspect of song learning: its social context. We compared how much young song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, learned from two kinds of adult 'song tutors': one with whom the subject interacted vocally, and one whom the subject only overheard singing with another young bird. We found that although subjects learned from both song models, they learned more than twice as many songs from the overheard tutor. These results provide the. rst evidence that young birds choose their songs by eavesdropping on interactions, and in some cases may learn more by eavesdropping than by direct interaction.

AB According to the socioecological framework, transitivity (or linearity) in dominance relationships is related to competition over critical resources. When a population is structured into groups, the intensity of between-versus within-group competition influences the form and function of its social organization. Few studies have compared the type and relative intensity of competition at these two levels. African elephants have well-structured social relations, providing an exemplary system for such a study. We report on dominance hierarchies among free-ranging elephants and evaluate the factors that drive their socioecological structure to lie in a region of the three-dimensional nepotism/despotism/tolerance space rarely observed among social species; namely, where non-nepotistic, transitive dominance hierarchies within groups emerge despite kin-based philopatry and infrequent agonistic interactions over widely distributed resources. We found significant transitivity in dominance hierarchies between groups. Dominance relations among the matriarchs of different social groups were primarily age based, rather than driven by physical or group size, and group matriarch rank influenced the dominance relationships among nonmatriarchal females in the population. Our results suggest that between-group dominance relationships induce tolerance among group members, which in combination with high group relatedness, reduces the benefits of nepotism. We postulate that cognitive abilities and high risk of injury in contests enhance winner and loser effects, facilitating the formation of transitive dominance relationships, despite widely distributed resources over which infrequent competition occurs. The interplay of cognitive abilities, winner and loser effects, resource distribution, and within- and between-group dominance relationships may produce behaviour in other strongly social mammals that differs from that predicted by a superficial application of current socioecological models.

AB Mating with males that have recently mated would be risky for females because the males may have limited sperm. Females should prefer males that can provide sufficient sperm for successful fertilization. We investigated whether female stone crabs prefer the larger of two males and which type of cue, visual or chemical, is more important for female mate preference. We then investigated whether females show mate choice in response to the risk of sperm limitation by exposing a receptive female in an aquarium to two males simultaneously: an unmated male with sufficient sperm reserves and a male with depleted sperm reserves. We tethered the males and wrapped their chelae to prevent interference in the females' choice. All females approached and mated with the larger males, indicating that females prefer larger to smaller males. Females located larger males by waterborne chemical cues. Using these cues, females showed a preference for unmated males with sufficient sperm reserves over sperm-depleted males, indicating that sperm limitation occurs in nature, and is a selection pressure in the mating strategy of female stone crabs. Thus, the influence of risk of sperm limitation on female choice should be considered in studies of sexual selection by field observations and laboratory experiments, and in sexual selection models.

AB We examined two hypotheses to explain the natal dispersal of Japanese serows: competition for mates and/or resources and inbreeding avoidance. We predicted that if the competition hypothesis were valid, serow offspring would disperse when the same-sex but not opposite-sex parent was present, whereas if the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis were valid, the opposite would apply. Only adult males were aggressive, and only to male offspring; this aggression may have led to offspring dispersing, although, over the 29-year study, no significant sex difference was found in the dispersal rate, mean age at dispersal or dispersal distance. All philopatric offspring, one male and two females, remained in the natal home ranges after the disappearance of the same-sex parent or territorial resident, and all 30 dispersals of both sexes occurred when the same-sex parent or territorial resident was present in the natal home ranges. Four male and five female offspring, however, left the natal home ranges after their opposite-sex parent had already disappeared. These results suggest that serow dispersal can be explained by the competition hypothesis. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A series of five experiments were undertaken to determine whether Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, that had learned to avoid eating an unfamiliar food (demonstrators) would mark the food (or its surroundings) in a way that reduced the probability that naive conspecifics would eat the marked food. We found no evidence that demonstrators aversively marked foods that they had learned to avoid. To the contrary, naive subjects ate more in areas soiled by demonstrators that had learned to avoid a food located there than they ate in unsoiled areas. Furthermore, when naive rats were given a choice between two samples of an unfamiliar food, one in an area soiled by demonstrators that had learned to avoid the food, the other in an area soiled by demonstrators that had not learned to avoid the food, the naive rats ate an equal amount in both areas. The data indicate that, as in social learning about food at a distance from a feeding site, residual cues deposited by rats around feeding sites directly affect where or what conspecifics eat, not where or what they avoid eating. We discuss possible ultimate explanations for this failure of naive rats to learn socially to avoid foods in areas that conspecifics soil after becoming ill.

AB Despite evidence that predators and parasitoid flies influence the evolution of song structure in crickets, much less is known about the influence of predators and parasitoids on crickets' use of refuges. Individual field crickets, Gryllus integer, differ in the amount of time they spend hiding in refuges when placed into a novel environment. Here, we studied the hiding behaviour of crickets from two populations (Arizona and California, U.S.A.) that differ in predation pressure. Tethering experiments conducted at both habitats demonstrated that more predators occur in the Arizona population's habitat than in the California population's habitat. We also found more parasitoid flies, which are attracted to male song, in Arizona than in California. We tested hiding times of both male and female crickets from each of the two populations in the laboratory. Male Arizona crickets from the high-predation habitat hid longer when placed into a novel environment in the laboratory than male California crickets from a low-predation habitat, although females from the two populations did not differ. Since the crickets we tested were the first-generation laboratory population derived from field-caught mothers, differences in behaviour were due to either nongenetic maternal effects or genetic effects. These results suggest that hiding times of male crickets in these populations have been shaped by natural selection acting through predation pressure.

AB Fish of the family Salmonidae (salmon, trout and charr) are famous for their ability to learn ('imprint') olfactory information as juveniles and to use those odour memories as adults to home to their natal site for reproduction years later. However, the spatial scale at which salmonids home has not been determined, and this is important not only for an understanding of the imprinting and homing processes but also because homing determines the spatial scale at which salmon populations are structured. To test the hypothesis that salmon home to specific habitat units within a single small creek, we induced banding patterns on the otoliths (ear bones) of pre-hatch sockeye salmon embryos by altering the temperatures at which they were incubated. Thermally marked embryos were buried in a small pond associated with Hansen Creek, in southwestern Alaska, and allowed to complete development and migrate. In the year when the salmon were expected to return to the creek, examination of otoliths from carcasses revealed that 12 of 324 salmon in the pond were marked, whereas all 138 salmon examined in the creek were unmarked. This distribution of marked fish indicates that more of the experimental salmon returned to the pond than would have occurred by chance, although we cannot be certain that all surviving salmon did so. These results contribute to the growing literature indicating the capacity for very fine-scale populations structure in salmon. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated the importance of experience for oviposition behaviour in two pyralid moths, the almond moth, Ephestia cautella, and the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella. We used two diets one based on wheat and the other consisting of nut-containing chocolate. Larvae were reared in one of the two diets (larval feeding) and then adults were exposed to the two diets during and after eclosion (pre-exposure). Larval feeding had an enhancing effect on the subsequent oviposition behaviour in E. cautella females, but not in P. interpunctella. This shows that the Hopkins' host selection principle to some extent applies in E. cautella. The pre-exposure strongly reinforced the ovipositional response to the previously encountered diet in both species. This effect might be caused by imprinting of the surrounding conditions in the females while emerging, and by stimulated oviposition when the imprinted cues are recognized by the gravid females. We observed both host location (flight) and host acceptance (oviposition), and the effect of experience was most prominent in the host acceptance step of the host selection behaviour. Since host acceptance is believed to be the most crucial decision step for offspring viability, this distinction was expected. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The reproductive success of a male is thought to be a function of the number of females he fertilizes. Nevertheless, various naturally occurring male behaviours seem to reduce dramatically the probability of obtaining additional matings. Such behaviours are expected when mating opportunities are limited for males and when males compete strongly for females or fertilizations. In widow spiders, males cohabit in females' webs, engage in long courtship displays, often lose the tip of one or both emboli (copulatory organs) inside the female's genital tract during copulation and are occasionally cannibalized by the female. We investigated conditions that may favour the evolution of a high-investment strategy of mating in white widow, Latrodectus pallidus, males. We followed male movements between females in a patchily distributed population of white widows and estimated the minimum number of males with which field-caught females mated from the number of embolus tips found in their genital tracts. The encounter rate of males with females was low with less than 20% of the searching males reaching a female. Females, in contrast, frequently mated with more than one male (up to six). We suggest that low encounter rates with females, coupled with high intrasexual competition, drives the evolution of a strategy of high investment by males in a single mating, as was observed in the white widow spider.

AB Prenatal chemosensory learning has been demonstrated in a wide variety of mammals, including humans, sheep, rabbits, rats and mice, and it may help to shape development and behaviour. The domestic dog, Canis familiaris, is renowned for its olfactory acuity. Furthermore, it belongs to an order of mammals (Carnivora) for which there has been no evidence of prenatal learning. We examined how prenatal exposure to a chemosensory stimulus (aniseed), via the mother's diet, affected the chemosensory preferences of neonatal pups. Pups received two-choice tests of aniseed versus water and vanilla (a novel odour) versus water. Twenty-four-hour-old pups exposed to aniseed during gestation preferred aniseed more than did pups not exposed to this odour (experiment 1) but showed no preference for vanilla over water (experiment 2). Thus, the preference was specific to the stimulus experienced in utero. Pups tested 15 min after birth showed a similar preference for aniseed (experiment 3), thus ruling out the possibility that postnatal exposure influenced the preference. The results indicate that prenatal chemosensory learning is present in the Carnivora and suggest that such learning may be present in all mammals, serving an important function in early mammalian development.

AB The visual systems of birds are hypothesized to have higher temporal resolution than those of humans, suggesting that they may be able to perceive the flicker emitted from conventional low-frequency fluorescent lights (LF; 100 Hz in Europe, 120 Hz in the U.S.A.). These lights are commonly used in the housing of captive birds and this may affect both their welfare and performance in experiments. We carried out mate choice experiments on European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, under both low- and high-frequency fluorescent lights (HF; > 30 kHz, at which flicker is imperceptible). Indicators of male condition and size, together with the reflectance spectra and length of the males' throat feathers, were also recorded to ascertain which variables correlated with female preference. Females ranked males consistently under HF, but not LF, lighting, and individual females chose different males under the two lighting types. Under HF lighting, females chose to spend more time with males that had longer throat feathers. The flicker rate of the light clearly affected the choices made by the females, possibly because of nonspecific stress effects or decreased discrimination ability. Our results imply that careful interpretation of mate choice experiments is needed, especially with regard to the lighting types used, to elucidate the real cause behind any variation shown.

AB Both vertebrates and molluscs (e.g. oysters) become more susceptible to disease after exposure to a stressor. Indirect evidence suggested that insects may become less susceptible to disease when exposed to stress. If true, this would force us to reconsider our hypotheses about the possible adaptive significance of stress-induced immunosuppression. We tested the effect of crowding, physical exercise, restraint, flight, heat, cold, agonistic behaviour and elevated levels of the flight-or-fight neurohormone octopamine on immune function and disease resistance (i.e. resistance to the bacterium Serratia marcescens) in the cricket Gryllus texensis. Crowding did not induce increased disease resistance (density-dependent prophylaxis); however, this result is difficult to interpret because mortality was higher for crowded crickets than it was for isolated crickets. Physical exercise, restraint, flight, heat and agonistic behaviour induced a decline in disease resistance. Restraint and heat also induced a decline in inducible lysozyme-like activity, suggesting a reduction in this immune function. Injections of octopamine resulted in a decrease in disease resistance, suggesting that it may affect immunosuppression after flight-or-fight activity. We have no evidence that stress induces a redistribution of immune resources resulting in enhanced wound surveillance. Following physical restraint, crickets were more susceptible to bacterial infection after wounding than were controls. The widespread occurrence of stress-induced immunosuppression suggests that it serves an important function. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A key issue in the study of the behaviour of copulating simultaneous hermaphrodites concerns the decision about which sexual role to adopt in a mating encounter. If two mates share a preference to adopt the same sexual role, mating interests are inherently incompatible. We review previous models that have explored the origin of, and resolutions to, such gender conflicts: (1) sex allocation models; (2) risk-averse models; (3) costly male function models; and (4) game-theoretical models. None of these satisfactorily accounts for the diversity found in hermaphrodite mating systems, either because the assumptions of the model reflect lifetime decisions rather than single mating decisions, or because only a narrow set of environmental conditions is considered. Furthermore, some often cited predictions such as a preference for copulating in the female role or a prevalence of conditional sperm exchange ('sperm trading') face limited empirical support. To reconcile and extend these previous ideas, we propose the gender ratio hypothesis as a more general model framework. Here, sex role preferences derive from the potential fitness gain per mating event. Preferences can thus vary considerably within and between individuals, but are predicted to be usually male biased. By combining sex role preference with mating rate, our hypothesis can explain the existence of a wide range of hermaphrodite mating systems, including unconditional reciprocity in systems where sperm trading has been predicted but not found.

AB Female baboons (Papio hamadryas spp.) must contend with myriad potential stressors on a daily basis. In a previous study on female chacma baboons, Papio hamadryas ursinus, living in the Okavango Delta of Botswana, increases in glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations were associated with female reproductive stage, male immigration and the threat of infanticide. Here, we extend this previous analysis to a larger data set with several additional potential stressors, including actual infanticide and instability in the female dominance hierarchy. A general linear mixed model showed that reproductive state, male immigration, infanticide, female rank instability and predation all had significant effects on GC levels. Lactating females' GC levels increased in response to the arrival of immigrant males and increased even further when infanticide occurred. In contrast, cycling and pregnant females' GC levels did not change. Females also showed elevated GCs in response to instability within their own dominance hierarchy, especially if their own ranks were at risk. Females' stress responses were frequent, but specific to events that threatened their own lives, the lives of their offspring, or their dominance ranks.

   DIMORPHISM; PHYLOGENY; PATTERNS; CHOICE
AB Physical constraints on animal signals can influence how challenging they are to produce, which in turn can provide potentially important cues about the condition or quality of a signaller. Some components of a signal are often more challenging to produce than others, however, and we expect animals to modify those elements that are especially costly so as to give high-intensity and demanding displays only when necessary. We found that Montezuma oropendolas, Psarocolius montezuma, modify a particular component of their songs during vocal contests, the lowest peak frequency (LPF). Songs that overlapped other males' songs during interactions at nesting colonies had slightly but significantly lower LPFs than did the same song types produced when singing alone. Other components of song, in contrast, did not change. We also provide evidence that the production of loud, low-frequency notes in this species is constrained by body size, based on a negative bounded relationship between mean measurements of LPF and tarsus length across 102 species and subspecies of New World blackbirds (Icteridae), the songbird family to which the Montezuma oropendola belongs. Measures of LPF in the songs of Montezuma oropendolas fall near the lower limit of what members of the family produce. Taken together, our results suggest that low-frequency notes in these birds might constitute an honest signal of competitive ability during male-male interactions.

AB Keas are extremely inquisitive birds that explore and manipulate objects with their beak and feet when foraging or at play. We investigated how captive keas face a problem that they have never encountered before: food objects suspended from a long string. Using this well-probed test for means-end comprehension, our aim was to see whether, and how, the keas solved the task. The seven subjects showed immediate interest in the string and, with the exception of a fledgling, reached the food by repeating combined actions of pulling up the string with the beak and holding loops of it against the perch with a foot. Four keas completed the first trial within a few seconds, by showing only goal-directed behaviour, thus executing the solution in a manner that could not be improved upon in nine further trials. The behaviour of the fledgling shows that the crucial element of the string-pulling competence is the beak-foot coordination. We then conducted four different two-string discrimination tests varying in the attachments and the spatial relationship of the strings to assess the keas' level of understanding of the functional proper-ties of the task. The subjects' performance suggests that their attention is drawn very quickly to the relevant properties of the strings, that is, their connection between perch and food. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the distribution of higher cognitive skills in the animal kingdom by showing high levels of sensorimotor intelligence in animals that do not use tools.

AB In species with long-term pair relationships, behavioural compatibility between mates could be a significant source of selection among pairs. We explored the relation between behavioural compatibility and reproductive success in cockatiels, a socially monogamous species with biparental care and variable compatibility. The mate behavioural compatibility measure, derived from our previous work with these birds, was based on five pair-level variables: proximity, behavioural synchrony, copulation, allopreening responsiveness and total aggression. We operationally defined mates as more compatible when they showed greater proximity, synchrony, allopreening responsiveness and copulation frequencies and lower frequencies of aggression. Using a captive, seminatural population, we tested the following three interrelated hypotheses: (1) pairs with greater behavioural compatibility before breeding should have greater reproductive success; (2) among pairs that laid fertile eggs, pairs with greater behavioural compatibility should show better incubation coordination and (3) pairs with better incubation coordination should hatch more fertile eggs. Our results were consistent with these hypotheses. Pairs that laid eggs had significantly higher behavioural compatibility scores than did those that laid no eggs. Pairs with higher behavioural compatibility scores reared significantly more chicks to independence even after controlling for the effects of pair bond duration and parental age. Among pairs that laid fertile eggs, mates with higher behavioural compatibility scores had greater incubation coordination, measured by periods during which only one parent at a time attended the eggs, and greater hatching success of fertile eggs. Behavioural compatibility between mates in socially monogamous species may have reproductive consequences, and emergent behavioural features of pair relationships may have evolutionary significance.

AB The evolution of prey warning coloration is, literally, a textbook example of Darwinian adaptive evolution by natural selection. The cornerstone of this evolutionary process is a predation event, the dynamics of which are poorly understood. Aposematic (warningly coloured) prey. are relatively unpalatable and their conspicuous appearance should enable predators to avoid them, but such is not always the case. Based on models of conditioned learning, it has been assumed that the number of aposematic prey that a predator will attack as it learns to avoid such prey should be constant or declining as the prey's abundance increases. However, empirical studies have shown that predators make more attacks on aposematic prey when those prey are more common. I suggest that this failure of theory to predict behaviour probably arises from limitations of the learning models in question. Rather than using mechanistic models of conditioned learning, I used signal detection theory to provide a functional characterization of the uncertainty that inexperienced predators encounter when learning to distinguish prey types. This characterization explains otherwise puzzling data on predation on aposematic prey and can offer insight on the selective pressures driving the evolution of aposematism and mimicry.

AB Recently, several studies have suggested that the biological literature may be biased because studies with particular effect sizes are more likely to get published. However, only one published direct test comparing effect sizes of a representative sample of published and unpublished studies exists in biology. We performed an additional direct test of publication bias, using studies of the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection. Samples of published and unpublished papers on this relationship were obtained by (1) checking the literature; (2) contacting scientists working on the subject; and (3) posting requests for studies against a reward on Web sites. There was no significant bias in respondents to our request as compared to nonrespondents with respect to effect size or other features of the published studies on the subject. Also, the characteristics of the studies of respondents with and without unpublished research on the subject did not differ significantly. Unpublished and published studies did not differ significantly in effect size adjusted for sample size, using random-effects meta-analysis. The number of unpublished studies we obtained, however, was moderate. Moreover, there was no evidence of a temporal change in mean effect size adjusted for sampling effort between a sample of studies conducted through 1996, a sample of studies conducted thereafter until June 2001, and the sample of unpublished studies in the present study. indirect tests for publication bias used on the three samples revealed little evidence of publication bias. In conclusion, there is a small to intermediate effect size weighted by sample size of the relationship between asymmetry and sexual selection, and this effect appears to be largely independent of publication bias as revealed by direct and indirect estimates of publication bias.

AB In scrambling species, where males obtain matings by actively searching for females, the timing and location of mating may be more important to females than choice of males based on phenotype. Since their activity rates are constrained by climate, variation in lifetime reproductive success in marginal populations of scrambling insects may be governed primarily by stochastic processes, limiting the role of selection. Using multivariate analysis, we examined activity patterns and lifetime mating success (LMS) in a marginal British population of Coenagrion mercuriale, a rare, scrambling damselfly, versus that in a core population of a similarly sized scrambling congeneric. Time spent at the breeding site and mating efficiency were the most important factors explaining variation (< 75% correct predictions) in LMS in both species, whereas body size, age, and day of entry to the mature population were unimportant. This suggests that LMS in these scrambling species is governed by sexual and natural selection as well as stochastic processes such as weather. However, in C. mercuriale, daily mating and-activity rates were highly constrained by poor environmental conditions (and increased with sunlight and temperature). Breeding site visits were so curtailed that an equal distribution of LMS between the sexes was observed. Selection in marginal populations of C. mercuriale may operate upon traits that confer endurance ability in poor environmental conditions rather than body size, life span or age. Climatic variation across species' ranges will in turn generate geographical variation in mating behaviour, in the intensity of sexual selection and the type of traits selected.

TI Passerine migrants respond to variation in predation risk during
   stopover
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID FORAGING BEHAVIOR; FUEL LOAD; FLOCKS; HAWK; BIRDS; SITE
AB During travel, migrants may encounter unfamiliar habitats and predators and visit sites for which they lack information on predation risk. Temporary stops during migration permit only limited opportunities to gather information about risk, and other priorities, such as the need to forage, may restrict these opportunities. Under these conditions, the extent to which migrants respond to variations in predation risk is unclear. We studied small passerine birds during migratory stopover to determine whether their behaviour was related to variation in risk of capture by migrating birds of prey. We used two approaches, observational and experimental. Observations revealed that blue-grey gnatcatchers, Polioptila caerulea, and American redstarts, Setophaga ruticilla, moved deeper into oak shrubs as the number of sharp-shinned hawks, Accipiter striatus, at the site increased. Furthermore, blue-grey gnatcatchers moved at slower rates as counts of hawks increased. The experiment revealed that blue-grey gnatcatchers had lower rates of both movement and foraging after exposure to a gliding model hawk. These results provide evidence that predator avoidance remains a priority during migration and that migrants are able to assess risk to some extent during temporary stopover. In addition, the results suggest that predator avoidance behaviour may limit foraging opportunities during stopover by restricting habitat use.

AB I investigated the effect of low molecular weight substances (volatiles) such as 3-methyl-l-butanal and 3-methyl-l-butanol together with the norsesquiterpenes on gyrinid beetle defence. Rainbow trout, Onchorhynchus mykiss, ate significantly more G. minutus (lacking volatiles) than G. aeratus (with volatiles). Rainbow trout often exposed gyrinid beetles to oral flushing after capture, but spent more time (energy) flushing if the beetle was to be consumed. They did not flush palatable prey; therefore, oral flushing seems to be a strategy to remove noxious chemicals from potential prey. However, when experienced fish tasted a new gyrinid they were quicker to reject gyrinids with volatiles than those lacking volatiles. Hence, volatiles appeared to make the gyrinids more distasteful and experienced fish did not waste time flushing gyrinids with volatiles. Instead they expelled the gyrinid quickly after taking the beetle into their mouth. It seems that the taste of a gyrinid, rather than its odour, is the more effective predator defence, since there was no difference in fish behaviour towards gyrinids with or without volatiles prior to tasting them.

AB The compensation hypothesis (CH) says that when impediments to the expression of mate preferences occur so that reproduction is with nonpreferred (NP) partners, mothers with NP mates compensate for lower-viability offspring through enhanced investment. Previously, we tested an assumption of the CH and showed that offspring viability was significantly lower when mothers reproduced with NP mates. Here we report tests of the CH. Egg mass differed significantly by mother agemate category. Second-year mothers in NP pairings laid significantly heavier eggs than second-year mothers in preferred (P) pairings; mean egg mass of first-year mothers with NP or P mates did not differ. However, mean egg mass per mother and mean number of eggs per mother were positively and significantly related. Thus, there was no trade-off between egg size and egg number for any category of mother. By fledging age, duckling performance, quality and condition were significantly lower for first-year mothers with NP mates compared with those for mothers in the other categories. Second-year, but not first-year mothers, successfully compensated for predictable deficits in offspring viability from reproduction with NP males. This is the first study showing that mothers compensate for viability deficits in offspring resulting from reproduction with NP partners. 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A recent revival of the theory of sexual conflict leads to new interest in the question of how much females control copulation. Using the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, as a model, I investigated the mechanisms with which males tried to persuade females to copulate with them. Analysing the outcome of a large number of experimental male-female encounters, I concluded that apart from some effect of male choosiness (preference for certain females), females were fully in control of copulation. Males did not differ in their abilities to overcome female resistance, either in terms of sensory exploitation (variation in ornamentation and display) or coercion (use of aggression). Variation in beak colour had no influence on male mating success, but male song rate may be a sexually selected trait: males that sang more frequently obtained more copulations, but this was because other males missed opportunities by not even attempting to display to females. Whenever a male started displaying, female responsiveness, and hence male copulatory success, was not influenced by how persistently he sang. These findings support a theory of chase-away sexual selection, rather than a good-genes theory, which has typically been invoked to explain variation in male song rate. Between-individual differences in male song rate may reflect alternative reproductive strategies (mating effort versus parental effort) rather than variation in male quality. Finally, I found marked differences in sexual responsiveness between females, which is not anticipated by current models of sexual selection and hence urges further investigation.

AB Numerous studies have measured the mating preferences of female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, using choice-chamber experiments, but no study has focused on how consistent individual females are in their choices and the extent to which females agree on their preferences, although these questions are of great conceptual importance. We conducted a large number of mate choice trials involving unmanipulated stimulus males, and found low but significant consistency (repeatability of time allocation by a female tested twice with the same set of males R = 0.29), and very low but significant between-female agreement (different females tested with the same set of males: R = 0.11). Although low individual consistency indicates that preferences were relatively weak or hard to measure, we found significant repeatability of individual preference functions with regard to beak colour, song rate and male aggressiveness when individual females were tested twice with different sets of males. This means that some females consistently preferred red-beaked males whereas others preferred orange-beaked males, some preferred high and others low song rates, and some preferred aggressive and others less aggressive males. Of these male traits, only song rate was positively related to average male attractiveness. Low between-female agreement did not seem to result from assortative mating for quality, because there was no repeatability of an individual female's preference for attractive or unattractive males. It is possible that disagreement follows from choice for genetic compatibility, but much of it could also result from weak preferences and little variation in male quality.

AB Within the vocal repertoires of many species, both males and females produce acoustic variants of the same call type. Despite the relative salience of the acoustic features that correlate with the caller's sex, little is known about the functional significance of this acoustic cue. Specifically, do conspecifics use this information when making behavioural decisions, implying that it is meaningful to signal receivers? And, if so, what selective pressures underlie the salience of the sex differences in call structure? Here we present a series of phonotaxis experiments designed to address these issues in the cottontop tamarin, Saguinus oedipus. We focus on the tamarin combination long call (CLC), a species-specific vocalization consisting of one to two chirps followed by three to four whistles, that functions in the context of social isolation and mate attraction. CLCs produced by males had significantly shorter whistles than those produced by females, although there was some overlap in the sex-specific ranges. Sex differences in the acoustic morphology of CLCs elicited consistent selective phonotaxis, suggesting that this acoustic cue is meaningful to signal receivers and that whistle duration is the primary acoustic feature used to determine the sex of the caller. Males preferred female CLCs consisting of the longest whistles, whereas females preferred male CLCs with the shortest whistles, suggesting that sensory biases in tamarins underlie sex differences in CLCs. These preferences persisted even when stimulus calls contained whistle durations that fell outside the natural range. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We used observations and manipulation experiments to investigate how meerkats, social mongooses living under high predation pressure, find shelter from predators quickly within their territory. We played back alarm calls to foraging meerkats and dug new boltholes and covered existing ones to see whether location or other cues were used. Meerkats almost always ran to the bolthole closest to them. This was not done by a simple rule of running back to a bolthole they had just passed, nor by escaping in any direction and finding a bolthole by chance. Meerkats nearly always ignored the boltholes that we dug but ran to those we had covered up. Our results support the hypothesis that meerkats know in which direction to run when an alarm call is given, without scanning the area for visual or olfactory cues of shelters. As meerkats have more than 1000 boltholes in their territory, our results suggest that they have detailed knowledge of the direction and the distance of specific locations. However,, this does not necessarily mean that,they have a spatial map of their territory; our results may be explained by place recognition or reorientation of specific landmark features.

AB The use of vocalizations by males to attract mates and defend territories is widespread in birds but uncommon in mammals. In the greater white-lined bat, males defend small territories in tree buttresses and produce complex audible vocalizations. During the day, females roost within these territories, and males with females in their territories have higher reproductive success than males without females. To determine call function, we recorded mate vocalizations on the island of Trinidad and made behavioural observations of the focal male and nearby, bats at the time the calls were given. Noisy broadband calls were directed mainly at other males whereas tonal calls were used primarily in interactions with females. Two other types of calls were given independently of any observable context and may be involved in territorial defence or conspecific notification. Poisson regression showed that males with song repertoires that contained more unique types of composite syllables had more females in their territories. In addition, several acoustic features of one common call type significantly correlated with the number of females on a territory. Male vocalizations may, therefore, transfer information to colony members about male quality or fighting ability. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In sequentially polyandrous birds, a female's second mate faces a substantial risk of cuckoldry due to rapid mate switching and stored sperm. Secondary males are potentially available to females because males arrive asynchronously and/or are recycled into the breeding pool following nest predation. In a study of red-necked phalaropes, Phalaropus lobatus, a sex-role reversed shorebird, we tested the hypotheses that the proportion of females that become polyandrous is proximately limited by: (1) the ability of females to produce eggs, (2) the availability, of males as mates and (3) male mate choice. In a colour-banded population in which rates of nest loss were manipulated by researchers, females that produced second clutches required similar lengths of time to complete clutches as those contemporaneously producing first clutches, and increased their egg size relative to their first clutch, making egg limitation unlikely. There was no correlation between an annual measure of males' availability as potential mates following nest losses and the proportion of females that were polyandrous. The majority of males that lost clutches (66%) repaired with their original female significantly more often than expected by random mate choice (P<0.0001). Although 76% of polyandrous nestings involved renesting males, only 6% (N = 46) of renesting males changed mates if their original female was still available. Renesting males that changed mates did not select for or. against females that had already produced clutches (NS). Our results suggest that the level of polyandry in this species is not constrained by the females' abilities to produce more eggs or by the number of males recycling back into the breeding pool. Instead, the proportion of females that become polyandrous is limited by males choosing to renest with their original females, thereby decreasing their probability of caring for eggs potentially fertilized by a female's previous mate.

AB Few studies have addressed the development of nonhuman primate infants' responses to conspecific vocalizations. Previous studies showed that the appropriate response to alarm, intergroup and long-distance contact calls emerged at about 6 months of age. It remained unclear whether this age constitutes a watershed in terms of infants' sociocognitive development or whether it was due to the types of stimuli used in the experiments. I therefore examined the development of infant Barbary macaque, Macaca sylvanus, responses to maternal calls, under the assumption that recognition of the mother is one of the tasks that infants should master as early as possible. I presented infants of different age categories with short bouts of screams recorded from their mothers or another female of the same social group. Experiments on yearlings confirmed the suitability of the experimental approach: yearlings responded significantly more strongly to maternal calls than to calls from unrelated females. Infants were tested at 4, 10 and 16 weeks of age. In the youngest age group, they failed to respond to the playbacks, whereas from 10 weeks of age on they responded significantly more strongly to maternal calls, suggesting that by this age they recognized their mothers by voice. These results suggest that the developmental trajectories in the domain of comprehension learning may be flexible, in the sense that infant responses may depend on the salience of, and the exposure to, the call type under study. The experiments also show that screams may transmit individual-specific characteristics that are perceptually salient to the listeners. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although many studies of vigilance examine head raising in foraging, grooming or resting animals, pauses during intermittent locomotion are rarely considered from the perspective of vigilance, and no studies have compared head raising and pausing in the same system. We videotaped central place foraging chipmunks, Tamias striatus, as they approached a patch, collected sunflower seeds, and left to return to their burrows. There was a strong similarity between head raising during foraging and pausing during intermittent locomotion. Chipmunks paused more frequently when moving towards the patch than when leaving the patch. Chipmunks in the patch raised their heads at an intermediate rate, which tended to decrease with time in the patch. Pauses and the duration of motionless periods during head raises were very short (similar to0.4 s), and their frequency distributions were similar. Animals remained motionless during 22% of the time spent approaching the patch, 14% of the time spent in the patch and 7% of the time spent leaving the patch. Rates of pausing and head raising generally decreased with short-term familiarity (number of trips to the patch) and with long-term familiarity (proximity of the patch to the burrow). Trials with higher pause rates when approaching the patch had higher head-raising rates in the patch. Whether the focal individual was solitary, dominant or subordinate in a dyad, or competing with multiple chipmunks in the patch had no effect on pausing or head raising. In a separate experiment, exposure to a model hawk increased pause and head-raising rates. We conclude that head raising during foraging and pausing during locomotion serve a similar vigilance function, that this vigilance is directed towards detection of predators rather than conspecifics, and that time allocated to vigilance is sufficient to significantly reduce foraging rates and affect many space use and foraging decisions.

AB The function of fresh green nest material has long been debated. It has been suggested that it reduces the number of ectoparasites in nests and on nestlings (nest protection hypothesis), or is used by males to signal condition and paternal quality (male quality hypothesis) or is used as a sexually selected ornament to attract females (courtship hypothesis). We simultaneously tested these three hypotheses in the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, in the field. Green material was carried by male starlings only, and mainly during nest building. It was not used to reduce ectoparasites. Males nesting in nestboxes that were experimentally contaminated with ectoparasites did not carry more green nest material than males nesting in control boxes, and experimental removal and addition of green material had no effect on the number of ectoparasites on the nestlings or on their body mass. Furthermore, the amount of green material carried into a nestbox was not associated with male body mass, paternal incubation attendance or nestling food provisioning. There is two-fold experimental evidence that males use green plant material to attract mates. First, removal of greenery resulted in a significantly lower percentage of nestboxes containing a clutch than the control or addition treatment. Second, unpaired male starlings sang more and carried more greenery into a nestbox when a caged female was positioned adjacent to the nestbox than when a caged male or an empty cage was present. Paired males, when subjected to the same experimental design, did not respond. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Male-male vocal interactions and the adjustment of song amplitude in a
   territorial bird
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID NIGHTINGALES; SOUND; COST; SIGNALS
AB Recent studies have shown that territorial songbirds do not maximize vocal amplitude. Instead, song intensity appears to be a flexible trait that is individually regulated. Given the benefits of singing loudly with regard to signal transmission in the context of territory defence and mate attraction, we investigated whether songbirds adjust the sound level of their territorial songs depending on social influences. While interacting with the playback of a simulated conspecific rival, seven male nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos, increased the sound level of their songs, on average, by more than 5 dB. The nightingales increased their song level to significantly lower values (about 1 dB) in response to control songs of other species, so the revealed increase in vocal intensity during interactions cannot be fully explained by the acoustical masking of the interfering conspecific songs. Thus, the birds improved signal transmission to a higher degree during conspecific male-male interactions. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Great tits, Parus major, display their white cheek patches to one another during intraspecific encounters. We measured the size of these patches and the regularity of their borders (immaculateness) as part of an investigation into their function as signals. Patch size was not significantly related to any of our measures of fitness, but male great tits with more immaculate cheek patches had significantly greater access to a safer feeding site in winter and produced heavier chicks in small woods. Females with more immaculate patches bred significantly earlier in 2 of the 3 years of the study in both large and small woods. We decreased the immaculateness of both sexes with dye and found that competition with other tits significantly increased their exposure to danger when feeding. Factors resulting in reduced immaculateness included ectoparasites, fighting with conspecifics, faster feather wear in young birds and the timing of the autumn moult. Selection for immaculateness by conspecifics may be one mechanism responsible for the evolution of regular head and body patterns in several species of birds and in other animals.

AB We present an individual-based model dealing with mating as a process of pair formation. Model simulations, based on data from a 19-year study of Spanish imperial eagles, Aquila adalberti, showed that the mating pattern of a population is not necessarily a direct consequence of the mating preferences of individuals; positive age-assortative mating, by which individuals of similar age are more likely to become paired, does not necessarily indicate homotypic mating preferences. For example, individuals of similar, young age may be constrained to a few low-quality territories, leading to passive assortative mating, independent of individual preferences. Confounding factors such as territory quality can affect the encounters between a male and a female available for mating, generating an age-assortative mating totally independent of mate preferences. Such a process may apply to many territorial species when spatial variation in territory quality is pronounced.

AB We studied mechanisms responsible for reproductive skew in female Alpine marmots. In each social group, only dominant females produced weaned young although subordinate females had similar body condition, were fertile as indicated by high levels of oestradiol during the mating season, and occasionally started pregnancies. During the period of gestation, dominant females initiated significantly more agonistic interactions against subordinate females, resulting in significantly increased levels of glucocorticoids and decreased levels of progesterone in subordinates. Results suggested that reproductive suppression in female Alpine marmots is mediated by the negative effects of stress (glucocorticoids) on the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The strength of competition between subordinate and dominant females was affected by their relatedness. Dominant females attacked unrelated subordinate females more, whereas amicable behaviour was observed mainly between dominant females and their daughters. These differences could be explained by differences in indirect fitness: related subordinate females benefited from warming the offspring of the dominant female during hibernation. Reproductive suppression was apparently costly for dominant females, because their reproductive success decreased as the number of adult subordinate females in a group increased.

AB The study of patterns and underlying mechanisms within hybrid zones may provide insight into speciation. Black-capped (Poecile atricapillus; BC) and Carolina (P. carolinensis; CA) chickadees hybridize in an east-west band in the U.S.A. from New Jersey to Kansas. Within the past century, the Ohio portion of this hybrid zone and the CA range to the south have been moving northward while the BC range has retracted. We examined mate preference in females of both species as one possible causal mechanism for this shift. To be conservative about the nomenclature and results, the samples are referred to as either 'BC-like' or 'CA-like' due to the observed genetic introgression in the study individuals. Given a choice within an aviary setting, in the aggregate, BC-like and CA-like females that had not observed the direct social interactions between a dyad of a BC-like male and a CA-like male preferred to associate with the BC-like male. In nature, both species form within-sex dominance hierarchies. In the aviary, CA-like males dominated BC-like males unless a CA-like male was substantially smaller. Once females of both types had observed the physical interaction of a particular heterospecific dyad, they associated preferentially with the dominant male, regardless of species type. Thus, the effect of CA male intrasexual dominance on female mate preference may be contributing to the northward movement of the hybrid zone.

AB To study whether offspring sex is related to the amount of resources invested in eggs we performed an experiment on zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. By manipulating their food supply, we forced two groups of females either to increase or to decrease investment in subsequent eggs. Since zebra finches are sexually dimorphic and the reproductive value of the sexes may vary with maternal nutritional status, we predicted that females would adjust the sex of their offspring to egg quality. Females that received poor-quality food for 7 weeks before egg laying, then food supplemented with proteins after they laid the first egg, significantly increased the mass of subsequent eggs. An increase of egg mass with laying sequence was less pronounced in females that received high-quality food before laying and experienced food deterioration after starting to lay. The proportion of sons in subsequent eggs tended to increase in the latter group (although this was marginally significant) but was not related to laying sequence in the other group: these patterns differed significantly between the groups. Offspring sex was not related to egg mass, but newly hatched male chicks were heavier than female chicks. Furthermore, the hatching success of male eggs was lower than that of female eggs. We suggest that differential hatching success of the sexes and sex differences in mass at hatching may constitute important factors shaping brood sex ratios.

AB Some prior studies of brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, suggest geographical variation in female copulatory responsiveness to the two categories of male courtship songs, flight whistles (FWs) and perched songs (PSs). Females from the eastern M. ater ater subspecies and midwestern populations of the M. a. artemisiae and M. a. obscurus subspecies were reported to give copulation solicitation responses only to playback of PSs. But females from far western populations of M. a. artemisiae and M. a. obscurus responded to both PSs and FWs. An east-west difference in the social salience of FWs could have an ecological basis. FWs are used mostly for long-distance signalling and because western birds have larger home ranges they may use FWs more often. However, the disparate FW findings may result from different procedures used to assess female responsiveness to playbacks. Determining whether the disparate findings are due to geographical variation or to methodological differences is important because many potentially significant insights into song development and female preferences in oscines are based on cowbirds: Furthermore, either explanation would elucidate important links between female choice and male sexual displays. To resolve this issue, we tested M. a. ater females from New York using identical procedures to those we used in the far west and found that they were highly responsive to both FWs and PSs. This does not support the hypothesis that there is pronounced geographical variation in the courtship salience of FWs. Rather, it suggests that different procedures used by researchers in different areas of the cowbird's range are responsible for the disparate findings.

   RELATEDNESS
AB Conspecific brood parasitism (CBP) is a common strategy in several species of birds. Currently, some studies suggest that relatedness between host and parasite enhances CBP, since indirect fitness benefits could select for acceptance of related eggs by hosts. Conversely, parasites should avoid laying eggs in nests of relatives if this is costly for the host. Based on the latter argument, kinship should not promote brood parasitism. A recent model clarified this relationship, and showed that kinship can promote brood parasitism, assuming kin recognition. However, in that model kin recognition was assumed perfect. Here we present a model that addresses the role of relatedness and kin selection in CBP, when kin recognition is not perfect and hosts do not always detect parasitism. We consider both the indirect fitness of the parasite and the possible responses of the host. Our results indicate that the existence and accuracy of a kin recognition system is crucial to the final outcome. When CBP represents a cost to the host, a parasitic female that has the choice should avoid parasitizing relatives, unless (1) the costs are not too high and (2) hosts can accurately enough recognize eggs laid by relatives, rejecting them less often than eggs laid by nonkin. But if 'parasitism' enhances the direct fitness of the host (which is possible in species with precocial young) parasites should choose relatives whenever possible, even if hosts do not recognize kin eggs.

AB Honest signals in sexual selection may be maintained by a variety of mechanisms. Comb size in male red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, a well-known predictor of female mate choice, is mediated by health and condition. Social status has also been shown to mediate comb size. To determine whether hormones related to male dominance behaviour might be related to social status and comb size, we monitored changes in plasma levels of testosterone and corticosterone following manipulation of social status. We removed young adult male junglefowl from their all-male flocks and placed them either in individual cages or in smaller flocks. We measured comb size and other morphological variables, as well as testosterone and corticosterone levels, before and after the manipulation of social status. Males in small flocks showed reduced comb growth, increased corticosterone and decreased testosterone levels compared with individually housed males. Within flocks, comb size was positively related to dominance rank and to testosterone level, although not always significantly. However, dominance rank was unrelated to either corticosterone or testosterone levels. In isolated birds, testosterone level was not related to comb size. Corticosterone level was not related to comb size in either treatment group. Our results are consistent with social mediation of comb size and testosterone and corticosterone levels, but it is unclear whether these hormones contribute to the observed social limitation of comb length.

AB We hypothesized that social learning is involved in the spread,. of cannibalism in domestic fowl Gallus gallus domesticus. To investigate this hypothesis without harming birds, we used an inanimate chicken model as our cannibalism stimulus. We randomly assigned flocks of 12 White Leghorn pullets to one of two treatments: (1) flocks with two trained demonstrators (N=9) and (2) control flocks (N=8). Demonstrators were trained to pierce a membrane covering a dish of chicken blood and consume the blood. To assess the effect of access to the cannibalism stimulus during demonstrations, we randomly assigned observer pairs to one of two observer treatments: (1) observe stimulus through a wire mesh partition and (2) observe stimulus within the same enclosure. We conducted five 10-min demonstration sessions, each followed by a 10-min test of each observer pair in the absence of demonstrators, over a period of 15 days when the birds were 41-55 days of age, and two further tests at 63-64 and 91-92 days of age. Pairs that observed demonstrators piercing a membrane and consuming blood were more likely to perform this task when tested than control pairs. Learning of the task was enhanced by direct access to the cannibalism stimulus rather than observing it through a wire mesh partition. Blood consumption during tests was increased by direct access to the cannibalism stimulus during demonstration sessions. The birds made bigger holes in the membrane when tested after observing trained demonstrators and after having direct access to the stimulus. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that social learning can contribute to the spread of cannibalistic behaviour in domestic fowl. We suggest that stimulus enhancement and observational conditioning were the social-learning mechanisms involved. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Noise-dependent song amplitude regulation in a territorial songbird

ID ACTIVE SPACE; AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; VOCALIZATIONS; NIGHTINGALES; BIRDSONG;
   HEARING
AB Some animals that use sound to communicate compensate for interference from background noise by adjusting the amplitude of their vocalizations as environmental noise levels vary. Territorial songbirds may have evolved a different strategy, since they can be expected to benefit from maximizing the amplitude of their songs to defend territories and attract females. We tested this hypothesis with calibrated measurements of the song level of male nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos. All birds increased the sound level of their songs in response to an increase in white noise broadcast to them. A second experiment revealed that noise in the spectral region of their own songs was most effective in inducing the birds to increase vocal intensity. These findings show that nightingales do not maximize song amplitude but regulate vocal intensity dependent on the level of masking noise. The adjustment of vocal amplitude may serve to maintain a specific signal-to-noise ratio that is favourable for signal production. Concurrently, increasing the intensity of songs can maintain a given active space for communication. Thus, vocal amplitude in a territorial songbird can be interpreted as a flexible trait, which is individually regulated according to ecological demands from signal transmission.

AB This experiment provides the first empirical evidence that symmetry preferences may arise as a by-product of animals' recognition mechanisms. We used a computer touch screen to train domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, to discriminate between rewarding and nonrewarding stimuli. The rewarding stimuli consisted of two slightly asymmetrical crosses that were mirror images of each other. After training, all subjects preferred a novel symmetrical cross to the asymmetrical training stimuli. Naive hens tested on the same symbols but without any previous training did not show any symmetry preferences. These results show that symmetry preferences can emerge after experiences with different stimuli that are asymmetrical but that are symmetrical when combined. A preference for symmetrical signals may thus arise as a consequence of generalization and without any link to, for instance, quality of the signal sender. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The climbing crab Sesarma leptosoma colonizes the mangrove roots and canopy of East African mangrove swamps, an intricate three-dimensional habitat in which it orients itself visually. To ascertain if vision helps this tree crab to detect dangers such as predators, we used dummy objects: (1) a preserved specimen of its predator, the crab Epixanthus dentatus in its typical ambush posture; (2) a piece of wood with real E. dentatus claws attached to it, the same size as, and painted to resemble (to the human eye), this predator; and (3) a piece of wood the same size and colour as a live crab but without claws. When these dummies were presented to migrating S. leptosoma in the field, they stopped their normal migratory flow only when they were able to see the open claws of the predator. Thus S. leptosoma showed a considerable ability to perceive shape, being able to distinguish motionless objects of different shapes but similar size and to associate the detected shapes with the presence of danger.

AB We recorded the behaviour of dogs in detour tests, in which an object (a favourite toy) or food was placed behind a V-shaped fence. Dogs were able to master this task; however, they did it more easily when they started from within the fence with the object placed outside it. Repeated detours starting from within the fence did not help the dogs to obtain the object more quickly if in a subsequent trial they started outside the fence with the object placed inside it. While six trials were not enough for the dogs to show significant improvement on their own in detouring the fence from outside, demonstration of this action by humans significantly improved the dogs' performance within two-three trials. Owners and strangers were equally effective as demonstrators. Our experiments show that dogs are able to rely on information provided by human action when confronted with a new task. While they did not copy the exact path of the human demonstrator, they easily adopted the detour behaviour shown by humans to reach their goal.

AB Shoaling fish are expected, in many cases, to gain fitness benefits from being in a larger shoal and previous experiments have shown that fish are indeed capable of choosing between shoals of different sizes. We investigated the influence of shoal activity on shoal size preference in the zebrafish. We gave test fish the choice between shoals of one to four stimulus fish, presented at two different water temperatures, and so differing in their activity levels. Where all stimulus fish were in water of the same temperature, test fish generally preferred the larger shoal. However, this preference could be reduced by presenting the larger shoal in colder water and so reducing its activity. We discuss these findings with reference to the factors that may influence shoal activity, the effect of temperature on shoaling behaviour and the mechanisms that may be used by fish to discriminate shoal size.

AB Acoustic signals are used for long-range communication in many animals from insects to birds and mammals. Long-range signals are used primarily by males to advertise and defend their home ranges or territories or to attract mates. During transmission over long distances, the structure of signals becomes progressively degraded. At the position at which a receiver makes a decision to respond, the characteristics of signals can differ markedly from those at the source. This degradation impairs extraction of information coded in the signal but also allows receivers to assess the distance (range) of the signaller. Auditory distance assessment (called 'ranging') is particularly important in territorial species as the optimal initial response often depends on the distance of the signaller. Perception of distance is comparatively well studied in animals but this work is not well integrated with information from related fields such as sound perception in humans or other animals. Here we review recent advances in studies of distance estimation and relate these to fundamental issues in sound transmission and sound perception. We consider the different components of signal degradation and how they can be measured in a perceptually meaningful way. We discuss limitations on the perception of degradation and the possibility that signallers might send deceptive information about their actual distance from a receiver. By integrating studies of auditory distance perception and studies of sound perception in animals and humans, we provide a framework for understanding the evolutionary implications of sound degradation in communication. manufacture.

AB Male Djungarian hamsters, Phodopus campbelli, are naturally paternal and actively participate in the birth and care of growing pups. Males undergo hormonal changes several days prior to the birth of their pups. Although these changes cannot be attributed to pup stimuli, they are nevertheless essential for the expression of complete paternal behaviour during and following the birth of the litter. We conducted two laboratory experiments to test the hypothesis that cues from the pregnant female are important for the expression of midwife and paternal behaviour in Djungarian hamsters. In experiment 1, we allowed pairs to mate, then removed the sires and housed them in separate cages in the same room as their mates. We then either reintroduced the sires 5 min later, or on the evening before the birth of their litter, or we did not reintroduce the sires. In experiment 2, we replicated the treatment of housing the sire and the female in separate cages in the same room until just prior to the birth of the litter, but ve added another group of sires that were housed in a different room (with independent air handling) until just prior to the birth of their litter. Male behaviour was not altered in any of the treatments: (1) reunions just a few hours before the birth were free of aggression; (2) males participated as 'midwives' during the birth at levels similar to previous studies; and (3) males provided extensive paternal care during pup growth, staying with pups on the nest during development and rapidly approaching, contacting and retrieving a 3-day-old pup that was experimentally displaced from the nest. We conclude that physical, olfactory, auditory and visual stimuli from the pregnant female are not necessary for the expression of paternal behaviour in this species. Alternative hypotheses, including the hypothesis that paternal behaviour does not require external stimuli, are worthy of exploration. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, engage in cooperative territorial defence and sometimes kill members of neighbouring communities. Observations of intergroup interactions suggest that escalation of aggression depends on numerical assessment, with lethal attacks occurring when numerical advantage reduces the costs of attacking. To gain a better understanding of the factors guiding participation in intergroup conflict, we conducted a series of playback experiments with the Kanyawara chimpanzee community of the Kibale National Park, Uganda. We tested whether the response to the playback of the 'pant-hoot' call of a single extragroup male depended on the number of adult males in the listening party, the location of the speaker relative to the territory edge, and each male's agonistic rank. These playbacks elicited cooperative responses, with the nature of the response depending on the number of adult males in the party. Parties with three or more males consistently joined in a chorus of loud vocalizations and approached the speaker together. Parties with fewer adult males usually stayed silent, approached the speaker less often, and travelled more slowly if they did approach. In contrast to many territorial species, the location of the simulated intruder did not affect the response. Although high-ranking males might be expected to benefit more from repelling outside males, both high- and low-ranking males showed a similar pattern of response. Each male responded as if he benefited from repelling intruders, but only if he had strength in numbers. This pattern of response is consistent with cooperation based on mutualism.

AB We used a geometric modelling approach to investigate how changes in the frequency in the environment of foods with different nutritional profiles affect the regulation of macronutrient (protein and digestible carbohydrate) intake and the pattern of food consumption of fifth-instar nymphs of Locusta migratoria (L.) (Orthoptera: Acrididae). Two experiments were conducted, both with insects individually housed in arenas containing four dishes of chemically defined synthetic food. In one experiment two nutritionally imbalanced, but complementary, foods (high;protein, low carbohydrate (P) and low protein, high carbohydrate (C)) were presented at different frequencies (4P:0C, 3P:1C, 2P:2C, 1P:3C and 0P:4C). The locusts regulated their feeding among the food dishes such that they defended their intake of both protein and carbohydrate, despite differences between treatments in the relative frequency of the two food types. In a second experiment, optimal (O) and suboptimal (either P or C) synthetic foods were paired in different relative frequencies. Despite the opportunity to ingest only optimal food, the locusts included suboptimal foods in their diet to varying degrees. However, they fed preferentially upon the. optimal food when it was presented along with dishes of suboptimal food and they increased their fidelity to dishes of the optimal food as they decreased in frequency relative to dishes of suboptimal food. Patterns of consumption in both experiments were consistent with the control of food choices and intake being governed by a combination of known mechanisms, including direct metabolic feedback and learning.

AB The benefits of group foraging depend on the frequency of feeding from food uncovered by companions (joining) versus self-discovered food (finding). Information-sharing (IS) and; producer-scrounger (PS) games predict different joining frequencies because they make distinct assumptions about food searching. IS games assume individuals can search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while PS games assume incompatible search modes; individuals search either as a producer, detecting only finding opportunities, or as a scrounger, detecting only joining opportunities; To determine the search assumption for flocks of ground-feeding granivores we studied the behaviour of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata, foraging in indoor aviaries for clumps of hidden millet seed. We looked for behaviour patterns preceding finding and joining events. An analysis of covariance showed that the frequencies of hopping with the head pointing up and down were statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the seed distribution, the birds' relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly When the seed distribution made any use of the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up declined to zero. Consequently, in ground-feeding birds such as spice finches, finding and joining behaviour conform more closely to the assumptions of a PS rather than an IS game.

AB A mate preference study on adult dampwood termites, Zootermopsis nevadensis subspecies nuttingi, supports the hypothesis that mate-seeking adults avoid forming partnerships with nestmates. The observed proportion of nestmate pairs formed from all potential pairs was Significantly less than expected. In addition, fewer pairs formed when there was a higher availability of nestmates versus non-nestmates. Genetic relatedness estimates, obtained from multilocus fingerprints of overwintering pairs, showed that relatedness between partners was not significantly different from background relatednesses of members chosen randomly from the population. Thus, nest-founding reproductive adults typically do not breed incestuously in this wood-dwelling termite. Furthermore, relatedness estimates between adult breeding males and between adult breeding females coinhabiting each log showed that there was a low probability of genetic relatedness among adults of neighbouring pairs, indicating that adults are typically dispersing in ways that minimize contact with relatives. Relatedness between laboratory-reared full siblings produced by field-collected pairs showed that relatedness was not significantly higher than r=0.50, which is expected if sustained incestuous breeding does not occur, or if cycles of inbreeding occur with negligible frequency among breeding adults. These findings do not support arguments that selection favours inbreeding because it confers disease resistance in termites. They also indicate that the level of genetic relatedness between nest-founding adults and among siblings cannot, by itself, explain the high levels of altruism within colonies of this single-site, wood-dwelling termite. Ecological pressures and the benefits of group living, together with ordinary genetic relatedness characteristics of outbred families appear sufficient to explain the advantages of kin-based altruism in wood-dwelling termites like Zootermopsis (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In recent years there has been a focus on display behaviours associated with the choice of a partner, theories of sexual selection being used to explain their occurrence. In monogamous species, however, the display behaviours continue beyond pair formation. In this paper I review display between the members of established pairs. Pair display occurs throughout the pair bond and often in several different contexts. Besides mate choice, these displays are commonly explained as serving a function in territorial defence and pair bonding, but these explanations seem unable to account for all observations of pair display. However, another suggested function of display is to manipulate another individual. An individual may, for example, manipulate its partner into providing more parental care. Such an explanation has the advantage of simply requiring that partners are in conflict for conspicuous display to evolve and may provide a new interpretation of the idea of pair bonding.

DT Article
ID AMPHIBIANS; SITE
AB We analysed the water-finding ability of 12 natterjack toads, after mild dehydration, in an experimental environment (octagonal arena) which provided geo- and hydrotactic, magnetic, olfactory and visual cues for orientation. We tested the hypotheses that the water-finding ability is based on pilotage, using gradients of waterborne cues, and that the cues used for water orientation differ between individuals. Random search behaviour of naive toads released in the arena showed that goal-oriented movements towards the exit leading to water required previous experience of the position of the water source. Thus, the water-finding ability of natterjacks is restricted to familiar areas. Physiological and behavioural responses to training and testing varied considerably between individuals: six toads became oedomatous and learned how to locate water, whereas the remaining six did not. We analysed the orientation behaviour of successfully trained toads in the training arena, when directional cues were removed or provided conflicting information, and present evidence for individuality in the use of orientation cues: three toads relied mainly on geotactic cues and olfactory pilotage, another mainly on visual landmarks and geomagnetic information, and another used all cues available without clear preference. In conclusion, to detect water, dehydrated toads rely on a multisensory orientation system, which is basically the same as that used during breeding migrations and includes several redundancies.

AB We summarize 20 years of empirical and theoretical research on causes and functions of social influences on foraging by animals. We consider separately studies of social influence on when, where, what and how to eat. Implicit in discussion of the majority of studies is our assumption that social influences on foraging reflect a biasing of individual learning processes by social stimuli rather than action of independent social-learning mechanisms. Our review of theoretical approaches suggests that the majority of formally derived hypotheses concerning functions of social influence on foraging have not yet been tested adequately and many models are in need of further refinement. We also consider the importance to the future of the field of integrating 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' approaches to the study of social learning.

AB We describe a model to predict the diet selection of a population of animals, based on simple assumptions about the characteristics of the individuals in a population, including the variation between them. Individuals are characterized by three parameters with biological relevance; a nutrient (protein) requirement, an ability to discriminate between foods of different protein contents and a need to collect information about both foods. Each animal selects perfectly a diet that avoids both a deficiency and an excess of protein, where this is possible. To construct the population two further assumptions are made. The first is that the values of each parameter are drawn from uncorrelated normal distributions subject to the values being logically possible. The second is that, for different mean values for the population, the standard deviation is directly proportional to the mean so that the coefficient of variation is independent of the mean. The model was used to predict the outcomes of six hypothetical experiments, using 100 individuals on each treatment, where the values of the three parameters were systematically varied. In the experiments one food was always of low protein content while the protein content of the other was the treatment variable. The quantitative effects of varying either the mean value of the parameters, or their variation, on both the mean composition of the diet selected, and on its variation, were not possible to predict without using the model. The shape of the population response was different to that for any individual. Extensions to the model may be able to increase its relevance to practical issues of diet selection.

AB In the black-winged damselfly, Calopteryx maculata, younger males challenge and displace older males from mating territories. Fatter males tend to win fights. These fights were initially interpreted as wars of attrition based on fat reserves, but the distributions of fat at the end of fights suggests at least some assessment of the opponent's condition. Alternatively, new models have been developed that show how the observed pattern could result without assessment. We show that there is a subtle but reliable cue to fat reserves: colour. Females are a relatively drab brown-black. Males are a strikingly iridescent blue-green colour, resulting from a multilayer constructive interference reflector system in the epicuticle. In fatter males the lamellae are more compressed and the peak reflectance is at shorter wavelengths (blue). Leaner, greener males have greater spacing between lamellae and reflect longer wavelengths. The peak reflectance is as predicted from transmission electron micrograph measurements of the lamellar spacing. The rate of change in spacing over time can be manipulated experimentally by manipulating the diet. Individuals on a higher food diet remained blue longer and at the end of the experiment were fatter and bluer. In our studies, colour is a better predictor of territorial status than fat.

AB We investigated how two sympatric species of freshwater mussels transmit their parasitic larvae to fish hosts. We found that Villosa nebulosa and V. vibex both display large mantle lures to attract potential host fish, but V. nebulosa displayed only at night and V. vibex displayed mostly by day. Display periods were similar in the laboratory and in the field. In two laboratory experiments, we found that the frequency of lure display in both mussel species was unrelated to the presence of fish or to the species of fish present. However, both species released more larvae in the presence of a suitable host fish (Micropterus spp.) and a nonhost species (Cyprinella camura) than in the absence of fish. In all treatments, females released low numbers of larvae on a daily basis throughout the experiment. We also observed several, irregularly occurring major release events in which numbers of larvae released were from one to three orders of magnitude larger than minor, daily releases. In V. nebulosa, major releases occurred with suitable and nonsuitable host species; in V. vibex major releases occurred mostly with suitable host species. In an additional laboratory experiment, we found that V. vibex released large numbers of larvae only when the host fish was able to make physical contact with the mussel. Few larvae were released when no fish were present or when host fish were present but physical access to the mussel was restricted. These results show that, in mussel species that display lures, physical interaction with a fish is necessary to stimulate large releases of larvae and suggest that interactions with a suitable host species stimulate larger and more frequent releases than with nonhosts.

AB In birds, conditions and experience in the nest may influence the social rank of juveniles after they become independent. Three main factors may be involved: (1) mass at fledging, larger birds being;better able to compete; (2) brood hierarchy, dominance in the brood continuing after the birds leave the nest; and (3) hatching date, birds hatching earlier having more experience and a greater ability to compete. I studied the effect of these factors on the agonistic behaviour of juvenile European shags, Phalacrocorax aristotelis, in creches. Of all the factors, only hatching date had a significant influence on the dominance rank of juveniles. Birds that hatched earlier had a higher rank. Additionally, males were somewhat more aggressive than females. The importance of an individual's hatching date for its social rank may have consequences for its future reproductive value.

AB I examine three hypotheses about predator avoidance behaviour: (1) avoidance increases an individual's reproductive success; (2) avoidance changes with breeding experience according to one of three described models; and (3) any reproductive or experience benefits accrued to individuals by avoidance are reflected in their spatial distribution. These hypotheses were tested on cheetahs which incur substantial juvenile mortality from predation by two larger competitors: spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, and lions, Panthera leo. To examine avoidance tactics, I played lion and hyaena vocalizations to individual female cheetahs. Lion avoidance increased with the statistical interaction between age and reproductive success, suggesting that it may be a learned behaviour, reinforced by successful reproductive events. This behaviour translated into a nonrandom spatial distribution of cheetahs with the most reproductively successful females found near lower lion densities than less successful females. Hyaena avoidance decreased with the interaction between age and reproductive success, suggesting that it is diminished by successful reproductive events, perhaps because a female cheetah switches from avoidance to using antipredator behaviours as she gets older. Hyaena avoidance behaviour translated into a spatial distribution with the most reproductively successful females found near lower hyaena densities than less successful females; however, younger females were found near lower hyaena densities than older females.

AB Female bonobos, Pan paniscus, show a mounting behaviour that differs physically from that in other primate species. They embrace each other ventroventrally and nib their genital swellings against each other. We investigated five hypotheses on the function of ventroventral mounting (genital contacts) that derive from previous studies of both primate and nonprimate species: (1) reconciliation; (2) mate attraction; (3) tension regulation; (4) expression of social status; and (5) social bonding. We collected data in six field seasons (1993-1998) from members of a habituated, unprovisioned community of wild bonobos at Lomako, Democratic Republic of Congo. No single hypothesis could account for the use of genital contacts, which appeared to be multifunctional. We found support for hypotheses 1 and 3. Rates of postconflict genital contacts exceeded preconflict rates suggesting that the display is used in the context of reconciliation. Rates of genital contacts were high when food could be monopolized and tension was high. However, genital contacts also occurred independently of agonistic encounters. Our study shows rank-related asymmetries in initiation and performance of genital contacts supporting the social status hypothesis: low-ranking females solicited genital contacts more often than high-ranking females while the latter were more often mounter than mountee. Although subordinates took more initiative to achieve genital contact, dominants mostly responded to the solicitation (ventral presentation) with mounting, indicating that the performance benefits both individuals. We suggest that genital contacts can be used to investigate both quality and dynamics of dyadic social relationships among female bonobos. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB While vocal learning has been studied extensively in birds and mammals, little effort has been made to define what exactly constitutes vocal learning and to classify the forms that it may take. We present such a theoretical framework for the study of social learning in vocal communication. We define different forms of social learning that affect communication and discuss the required methodology to show each one. We distinguish between contextual and production learning in animal communication. Contextual learning affects the behavioural context or serial position of a signal. it can affect both usage and comprehension. Production learning refers to instances where the signals themselves are modified in form as a result of experience with those of other individuals. Vocal learning is defined as production learning in the vocal domain. It can affect one or more of three systems: the respiratory, phonatory and filter systems. Each involves a different level of control over the sound production apparatus. We hypothesize that contextual learning and respiratory production learning preceded the evolution of phonatory and filter production learning. Each form of learning potentially increases the complexity of a communication system. We also found that unexpected genetic or environmental factors can have considerable effects on vocal behaviour in birds and mammals and are often more likely to cause changes or differences in vocalizations than investigators may assume. Finally, we discuss how production learning is used in innovation and invention, and present important future research questions. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated individual differences in copying behaviour of captive great tits, Parus major, by analysing their response to a tutor indicating a new feeding site. We used two groups, each di seven male birds, labelled 'fast' and 'slow' explorers based on previous studies in which consistent individual differences in the speed of exploring were found. The birds were trained to search for food hidden in a number of differently coloured and shaped feeders, and later to search in only one type of feeder. During the tests, food was absent and the birds were observed in two different situations: alone or in the presence of a tutor, a bird that had been trained to feed in a different kind of feeder. When alone, slow birds readily extended their search to other feeders while fast birds did not change their routine of visiting the previously rewarded ones. In the presence of the tutor, the opposite occurred: slow birds did not change their behaviour while fast birds significantly increased their visits to the feeders indicated by the tutor. Fast and slow individuals thus differ in their foraging and copying behaviour, consistent with the producer-scrounger model. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID CHICK FOREBRAIN; DOMESTIC CHICK; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BRAIN;
   IMMUNOREACTIVITY; MECHANISMS
AB In the investigation of the neural mechanisms of filial imprinting, neurochemical measures are often correlated with preference score (PS): approach activity to the training stimulus/total approach in a test. In a previous study, domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, that had a PS under 65%,were classed as 'poor learners' and those with a PS greater than 65% were called 'good learners'. We tested the effects of continued imprinting training in chicks from these two categories. After exposure to an imprinting stimulus for 30 min on day 1 after hatching, preferences were tested and then the chicks were exposed to the same stimulus for either 90 min, 3 h or 4 h on the next day, followed by a second preference test. In all these experiments there was a significant improvement in mean I'S in the 'poor learners' between the first and second test, such that these chicks acquired a significant mean preference for the training stimulus. There was no such improvement in chicks that did not receive further training on day 2. When absolute approach was analysed, there was no significant difference between 'poor learners' and 'good learners' at the second test, after 4 h of retraining. Overall, mean preference scores increased with length of training. These results suggest that 'poor learners' are better characterized as 'slow learners', and that their initially low PS is not caused by, for example, a lack of motivation to express a preference. Preference scores reflect the strength of learning during imprinting. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Oscine songbirds are exposed to many more songs than they keep for their final song repertoire and little is known about how a bird selects the particular song(s) to sing as an adult. We simulated in the laboratory the key variables of the natural song learning environment and examined the song selection process in nine hand-reared male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, a species in which males sing 5-11 song types. During their second and third months (their presumed sensitive period), subjects were rotated equally among four live adult male tutors that had been neighbours in the field. Tutors were housed in individual aviary 'territories' in four corners of the roof of a building; subjects could see only one tutor at a time, but they could hear the others at a short distance. Later in their first year (months 5-12), half the subjects were again rotated among all four tutors and the other half were randomly stationed next to just one tutor. Results from this experiment confirm and extend the findings from our two previous field studies of song learning in this species. Young males in this experiment (1) learned whole song types, (2) learned songs from multiple tutors, (3) preferentially learned songs that were shared among their tutors, (4) learned songs that other young males in their group also chose, and (5) learned more songs from the tutor they were stationed next to during the later stage (stationary subjects). These last two results support the late influence hypothesis that interactions after a bird's sensitive period affect song repertoire development.

AB Assessment of vocal imitation requires a widely accepted way of describing and measuring any similarities between the song of a tutor and that of its pupil. Quantifying the similarity between two songs, however, can be difficult and fraught with subjective bias. We present a fully automated procedure that measures parametrically the similarity between songs. We tested its performance on a large database of zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, songs. The procedure uses an analytical framework of modern spectral analysis to characterize the acoustic structure of a song. This analysis provides a superior sound spectrogram that is then reduced to a set of simple acoustic features. Based on these features, the procedure detects similar sections between songs automatically. In addition, the procedure can be used to examine: (1) imitation accuracy across acoustic features; (2) song de development; (3) the effect of brain lesions on specific song features; and (4) variability across different renditions of a song or a call produced by the same individual, across individuals and across populations. By making the procedure available we hope to promote the adoption of a standard, automated method for measuring similarity between songs or calls.

AB Male field crickets produce calling songs, courtship songs, tactile signals and chemical signals. Although calling songs are known to play an important role in female mate choice, the importance of the other signals in mate choice is poorly understood. In the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, females select mates, in part, based on variation in male calling song, Females prefer higher chirp rates, a trait which is partially dependent on male nutrient intake, and females prefer longer chirp durations, a trait which appears to be independent of male nutrient intake. We tested whether females also have preferences based on variation in male courtship song, and whether the structure of male courtship song varies with nutrient intake. First, we reexamined female preference for calling song chirp rate. Then, we examined: (1) female preference based on courtship song chirp rate; (2) the relative importance of calling song and courtship song chirp rate; (3) the nutrition dependence of courtship song chirp rate; and (4) the correlation between calling song and courtship song chirp rate. As reported previously, females preferred higher calling song chirp rates, and in addition, preferred higher courtship song chirp rates. Females were more likely to switch from a speaker broadcasting more attractive calling song to a speaker broadcasting less attractive calling song when the attractive calling song was associated with an unattractive courtship song than when it was associated with an attractive courtship song. Preferences based on courtship song may thus cause females to alter the choices that they made based on calling song. Males that received greater nutrients did not produce higher courtship song chirp rates. There was no correlation between calling song and courtship song chirp rate. As a result, the two traits may provide information to females about different aspects of male quality. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Honest sexual signalling requires that the level of advertisement reveals mate quality. In the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, females base their mate choice mainly on the intensity of the males' red breeding coloration. Different results have, however, been obtained on the relationship between red breeding coloration and physical condition. In this study, the relationship was curvilinear in a natural population, with males in good and poor condition (measured as lipid content) having larger red areas than males of intermediate condition. By manipulating food intake and thus male condition prior to breeding, I further show that poor condition can induce an increase in signalling effort. This effect was further strengthened when the predation cost of signalling was increased by exposing the males to predators. This suggests that the reason for the high signalling effort of males in poor condition is their low probability of future reproduction and thus lower cost of signalling in terms of loss of future reproductive opportunities. Males in poor condition signal as a terminal effort and take larger risks and invest more in current reproduction than males in good condition. Finally, I discuss whether an effect of decreasing residual reproductive value on signalling effort could result in the breakdown of the honesty of the signal.

AB Birds that range over a large area will have a greater mass-dependent risk of predation than more sedentary birds. Birds that travel more may then reduce winter mass gain to compensate for the increased predation risk that greater travelling entails. I tested whether European blackbirds, Turdus merula, that travelled more in winter had a lower mass than more sedentary birds, independently of any confounding effects of food supply on both ranging behaviour and mass gain. I measured change in winter mass and amount of food eaten in conjunction with the distance that blackbirds travelled to a randomly sited mobile feeder. Blackbirds that travelled shorter distances (per trip and in total) and less often to the feeder had the highest mass midwinter relative to their spring mass. Blackbirds with a higher mean mass midwinter also travelled, on average, shorter distances to the feeder. The distance an individual blackbird travelled to the feeder at any one time was probably independent of the state of its daily energy reserves (how much of its daily total mass gain it had achieved at that point). The relationship between distance travelled and mass was probably independent of food supply because distances actually increased at the end of the winter and the amount of food eaten per individual changed little. More mobile blackbirds were therefore likely to have compensated for any increases in predation risk associated with their greater ranges by decreasing winter mass gain, but will have had an increased risk of starvation because of their lower mass.

AB Models that address facultative siblicide in avian species predict that the costs and benefits of sibling aggression will change in relation to the level of food provisioning by parents. In spotted hyaenas, Crocuta cracuta, one of the few mammalian species in which facultative siblicide occurs, aggression rates between siblings were highest when cubs competed for access to maternal milk. In the Serengeti National Park Tanzania, nursing of cubs by spotted hyaena mothers was influenced by the migratory movements of herbivores and the social status of the mother. Consistent with predictions from avian models, rates of sibling aggression among spotted hyaena littermates were inversely related to levels of maternal input in terms of lactation. Long-distance foraging trips by mothers (commuting trips) resulted in low cub growth. Rates of aggression were higher in years when cub growth rates were low than in years when cub growth rates were medium or high. Rates of aggression between littermates belonging to high-ranking mothers, who nursed their cubs more frequently than low-ranking mothers, were lower than those between siblings of low-ranking mothers. Aggression rates in all-female and all-male litters were higher than in mixed-sex litters. Identical payoff expectations of same-sex litters may provide an explanation for this result. In accordance with predictions from life history theory, aggression rates declined with age and increasing reproductive value of siblings. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Does learning affect the structure of vocalizations in chimpanzees?

ID PANT HOOTS; CALLS; VARIABILITY; BEHAVIOR; BATS
AB We recorded 'pant-hoot' vocalizations from male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, housed in two captive facilities in the U.S.A., Lion Country Safari and-North Carolina Zoological Park. Acoustic analysis revealed significant differences between the two groups in the temporal patterning of the calls. Because the captive males within each group are from diverse origins, within-group similarity in pant-hoot structure could not have resulted from genetic similarity of the callers. In addition, there were no obvious differences in housing conditions that could have caused the between-group differences. Instead, the results suggest that the calls in each group converged in structure as a consequence of vocal learning. Within-group variation in call structure of the captive groups was similar to that found in a group of wild Ugandan chimpanzees (Kanyawara study group, Kibale National Park), suggesting the presence of species-specific constraints on this call within which different populations can converge on local variants. In addition, an acoustically novel pant-hoot variant that was introduced by one male to the Lion County Safari colony spread to five other males in the same colony. This suggests that chimpanzees may also be able to modify the frequency parameters of their calls through learning. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Individual birds are expected to maximize their fitness by directing their chick-feeding effort only towards broods containing closely related nestlings. We tested this prediction using data from the cooperatively breeding Arabian babbler, Turdoides squamiceps. Individual chick-feeding effort, in the form of visit rates and load sizes delivered to the nest, was compared with three measures of relatedness: (1) band-sharing coefficients derived from multilocus minisatellite DNA fingerprints; (2) coefficients of relatedness based upon pedigrees inferred from observed group histories; and (3) observed information on relatedness that was available to the birds themselves. There was little effect of any of the three measures of relatedness on individual visit rates or load sizes delivered to the nest, both across individuals and within each group separately. In the majority of cases, we conclude that individual birds did not have access to sufficient information concerning their relatedness to the brood. As in certain other group-territorial cooperative breeders, Arabian babblers may best direct their effort towards relatives by simply feeding any nestlings that appear on their territory.

AB We used an eight-arm radial maze to assess the relative contributions of learned patterns of movement (algorithmic behaviour) and spatial memory to the foraging efficiency of two sympatric rocky-shore fish, fifteen-spined stickleback, Spinachia spinachia, and corkwing wrasse; Crenilabrus melops, exploiting nonrenewable food sources. To forage efficiently, subjects had to avoid arms already depleted within a trial. In the absence of spatial cues, sticklebacks and wrasse improved their foraging efficiency by developing the algorithm of visiting every third arm. In the presence of spatial cues (coloured tiles) algorithmic behaviour was largely subsumed by the use of spatial memory. Imposition of a delay within trials reset the behavioural algorithm, so depressing foraging efficiency in the absence of cues, but not in their presence when memory could be used to guide behaviour. Memory retention for previous choices (working memory) lay within the range 0.5-5.0 min, consistent with the characteristic timescale expected for habitats where prey distribution changes rapidly during the tidal cycle. We considered two hypotheses on the type of information memorized: the cue list hypothesis and the spatial configuration hypothesis. The cue list hypothesis predicts that neither random repositioning nor fixed rotation of spatial cues should impair foraging efficiency, whereas the spatial configuration hypothesis predicts that efficiency should be impaired by random repositioning of cues but not by rotation. Data supported the spatial configuration hypothesis. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB I investigated male and female sexual strategies pf a cardinalfish, Apogon niger, which breeds in sandy areas at sporadic coral colonies. Males mouthbrood an egg mass received from one female ata time. Because of the lengthy mouthbrooding period, the interspawning interval was shorter for females than for males. Females moved between coral colonies to find mates more extensively than did males, and more frequently deserted mates after spawning. The females shortened their interspawning intervals by changing mates, especially in the late bleeding season, when their mobility was highest. Their mobility was positively correlated with their disappearance rate, suggesting that mate search increases mortality, This may reduce competition between females for males, resulting in an unbiased rather than female-biased operational sex ratio. Males, on the other hand, practised filial cannibalism of entire broods, which might allow them partially to compensate for the lack of food during the mouthbrooding period. The reproductive loss entailed by filial cannibalism could be effectively offset if males remate soon afterwards. However, cannibal males took a long time to remate because few females were available. Filial cannibalism was less frequent than in a boulder-dwelling congener in which males have easy access to mates. Low mate availability may inhibit male A. niger from committing filial cannibalism.

AB We investigated the function and transmission of signals that regulate worker reproduction in the ponerine ant Diacamma sp. from Japan, in which the morphological queen caste is absent and a mated worker (gamergate) reproduces as a functional queen in each colony instead. An inhibitory effect of a gamergate pheromone has been inferred in this species, because virgin workers frequently lay eggs in colonies without a gamergate, but rarely do so in the presence of one. We restricted the movements of gamergates and workers in experimental nests: one group of workers always had a gamergate present; another group had no gamergate; and a third group could choose between having contact with a gamergate and avoiding contact. Only workers that had no contact with a gamergate were aggressive and developed ovaries with fully mature oocytes. The gamergate signal was thus nonvolatile and passed on only by direct physical contact with workers. Theoretically, there should be a gamergate-worker conflict over male production; however, workers apparently responded to the gamergate's presence by refraining from egg laying. The gamergate signal may inform workers of the presence of a gamergate who can police their reproduction. Even when given the opportunity to avoid direct contact with the gamergate and thereby escape its policing, the workers did not do so and never oviposited. This behaviour may be a kin-selected trait, which mediates workers' sterility and in turn enhances colony efficiency. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals that are warned about the presence of a predator are more likely to avoid and/or survive an encounter with a predator. Chemical signals released by disturbed or injured conspecifics may provide prey animals with an early warning. In this study we conducted experiments to determine whether larval red-legged frogs respond to chemical stimuli produced by disturbed conspecifics and to examine the chemical compounds that may act as the alarm signal. In laboratory tests, groups of tadpoles responded with antipredator behaviours when exposed to chemical cues of disturbed conspecifics but not when exposed to chemical cues of control (undisturbed) conspecifics. In subsequent tests, disturbed animals increased ammonium (the main metabolic waste of tadpoles) excretion relative to undisturbed individuals. When tadpoles were exposed to low-level ammonium concentrations (1 mg NH4+/litre), they responded by increasing antipredator behaviours. Our results suggest that red-legged frog tadpoles release a chemical that provides conspecifics with an early warning of predator presence, and that ammonium (NH4+) may be a component of the disturbance signal.

   BEHAVIOR; ODORS; PENNSYLVANICUS; DISCRIMINATION; RELATEDNESS; MECHANISMS
AB Traditionally, sibling recognition in prairie voles has been inferred by incest avoidance or lack of reproduction among littermates. Previous studies have shown that isolation of sibling prairie voles for 8-15 days causes the breakdown of incest avoidance. However, in a re-evaluation of these studies, using social interactions within sexes (amicable versus agonistic behaviours), rather than incest avoidance, we found that incest avoidance might not be the best criterion for inferring sibling recognition in this species. When sibling prairie voles were isolated far less than 20 days, same-sex siblings still showed evidence of recognition in social encounter tests. Only after 20 days of isolation did sibling prairie voles show low levels of amicable behaviours and very high levels of agonistic behaviours; therefore, treating their siblings in the same way that they treated nonsiblings. Sibling recognition should be seen as a continuum, which can be inferred and detected experimentally at different time intervals by different approaches (incest avoidance or social interactions). Our results help to elucidate the effects of isolation on sibling recognition and help to determine the possible mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of social memory for recognition cues after periods of isolation.

AB In some salmonid species, the females have been assumed to choose their mates on the size of the male's adipose fin. This hypothesis was tested in a stream water aquarium, in which 19 brown trout, Salmo trutta, females were allowed to choose between two males of the same body size but with different adipose fin sizes. The two males were separated from each other in cages. After the female had started to prepare her nest close to one of them, the males were released and allowed to fight each other for the opportunity to spawn. Out of 19 females, 14 prepared a nest closest to the male with the larger adipose fin. However, only six of the 14 females spawned with this male. Males that spawned were more dominant (i.e. were more likely to win fights). When the female spawned with the male she chose, he was less aggressive towards her than when she spawned with the other male. There were no significant differences in the plasma levels of testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) between the chosen males and those not chosen. However, the dominant males had significantly higher plasma levels of T and 11-KT both before and after the experiment. The results support the view that female brown trout exhibit mate choice, but their choice is overruled by male-male competition. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We evaluated how various phylogenetic models for estimating ancestral characters can influence studies of behavioural evolution. Previously we used a single model of evolution to estimate the values of call characters at ancestral nodes for the Physalaemus pustulosus species group and some-close relatives (Ryan & Rand 1995, Science, 269, 390-392). We then synthesized these ancestral calls and measured the females' responses to such calls in phonotaxis experiments. We repeated the above procedure to determine the sensitivity of these results and conclusions to various models used to estimate the ancestral call characters. We asked whether: (1) different models gave different call estimates for the same nodes; (2) different call estimates at the same node were perceived as different by females; and (3) differences in female responses influenced previous conclusions. We used seven different models that varied in at least one of the following parameters: tree topology (bifurcating versus pectinate in-group trees), algorithms (local squared-change versus squared-change parsimony), tempo (gradual or punctuated evolution), and outgroups (two or three outgroup taxa used). Although different models often gave different call estimates for the same node, these different estimates often were not perceived as different by the females. These data reinforce our previous conclusions that: (1) the range of female preferences exceeds the known variation of the conspecific call; (2) females do not discriminate between the conspecific call and the call of their most recent ancestor; and (3) female responses may be context dependent, given that females differ in their responses to the same signal variation in discrimination and recognition experiments.

AB Problems associated with communication in noisy environments include detection, discrimination, and localization of appropriate signals. I investigated the effects of broadband background noise on call detection by female Hyla ebraccata, a Neotropical treefrog. In playback experiments, I offered females a choice between two stimuli: chorus noise alone or chorus noise plus a computer-synthesized call. By systematically increasing the level of chorus noise, I determined that females could no longer reliably choose between the two speakers when the signal-to-noise ratio was +1.5 dB or lower. By taking the distribution of calling males into account, I estimated that females detect only the nearest male. If a female were to sample more than a very few males, she would need to move around the chorus. By doing so, she probably increases the costs of mate choice. Thus, the noise of a chorus impairs the ability of females to detect conspecific calls and thereby limits their ability to choose between mates. These limitations could have serious implications for the evolution of signallers' and receivers' behaviour. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We investigated the motivational control of caching behaviour in scrub jays using a two-stage procedure to examine the effects of prefeeding and/or precaching (stage 1) on subsequent caching behaviour (stage 2). Experiment 1 demonstrated that both prefeeding and precaching reduced the subsequent caching of both edible (peanuts) and inedible (stones) items. The reduction in caching was greatest when the items available for storing were the same in the two stages. This item specificity was confirmed in experiment 2 using two food types, peanuts and dog food kibbles. The final experiment demonstrated that the effect of prefeeding on subsequent caching can also be food specific, in that birds that received food in a powdered form that they could eat, but not cache in stage 1, showed a reduction in subsequent,caching in stage 2 only when the food type was the same in the two stages. These results suggest that caching behaviour is controlled by both the feeding system and an independent caching system, and that this control is mediated by the incentive value of the specific items rather than by a general motivational state.

AB Social inertia is a term for the stability of dominance relationships despite changes in the intrinsic dominating abilities of opponents. In a standard test for social inertia, low-ranking birds in an established hierarchy receive implants with testosterone (treated) and high-yanking birds receive empty implants (untreated). Social inertia occurs when the treated birds remain subordinate to untreated opponents in these groups, despite evidence that similarly treated birds dominate untreated strangers. In previous demonstrations of social inertia, however, treated and untreated birds were returned to their original aviaries and tested with familiar opponents, and thus the effects of familiarity with the location and those of familiarity with opponents were not separated. To address this issue, we investigated social inertia in 16 groups of white-throated sparrows, Zonotrichia albicollis. When low-ranking treated birds were placed in new aviaries with familiar high-ranking, untreated opponents (treatment S, same opponents), dominance relationships showed social inertia. When such birds were placed in new aviaries with unfamiliar opponents (treatment N, new opponents), testosterone influenced-dominance. When groups of high-ranking, untreated birds acquainted with each other were placed with unfamiliar treated opponents (treatment G, grouped dominants), 'coat-tail' effects (dominance by association with high-ranking individuals) sometimes outweighed the effects of testosterone; Social inertia in this species is thus a result of familiarity with opponents, rather than familiarity with locations of encounters. Measurements of aggressive tendencies confirmed a previous report that social inertia suppresses activation of aggression by testosterone. White-throated sparrows can thus recognize their opponents, and this ability affects the expression-of both dominance and aggression. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Scent marking is ubiquitous among the dwarf antelope and gazelles of Africa, but its function has been the subject of debate. This study examined preorbital gland scent marking in the oribi, Ourebia ourebi, a territorial African antelope. Several hypotheses for the function of scent marking by territorial antelope were tested with observational data. Of these, the hypotheses that scent marking is driven by intrasexual competition between neighbouring males, and that marks serve as an honest advertisement of a male's ability to defend his territory from rivals, were supported best. Thirty-three territorial male oribi on 23 territories marked most at borders shared with other territorial males, and territorial males marked more often at borders shared with multimale groups than at borders shared with a single male. This suggests that males perceived neighbouring male groups as a greater threat to territory ownership than neighbouring males that defended their territories without the aid of adult subordinates. Marking rate was unrelated to territory size or the number of females on adjacent territories, but males with many male neighbours marked at higher rates than those with fewer male neighbours. These results suggest that the presence of male neighbours has a greater effect on the scent marking behaviour of territorial antelope than has been considered previously.

   POPULATION; SELECTION; BIRDS
AB Although a number of hypotheses have been proposed for how European cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, females may find hosts belonging to their foster parents' species, clear evidence is lacking for any of them. Here, we propose 'habitat imprinting' as an alternative mechanism for host selection and provide evidence that cuckoos are able to remember acquired information about a familiar habitat. We hand-reared seven cuckoos in one of five different artificial habitats and tested them as adults in habitat choice experiments. In each test habitat, a pair of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttuta, was presented as 'hosts'. We tested cuckoos of both sexes because the genotype of males may influence egg colour, and therefore egg mimicry; alternatively, habitat imprinting may be a general mechanism existing in both sexes but affecting egg mimicry only via females. Test cuckoos spent significantly more time looking at their respective familiar habitats than at other habitats in 1 of 2 test years. How long cuckoos were reared in the artificial habitats correlated positively with how long they spent in this habitat during the choice experiments. Additionally, test cuckoos remained longer with zebra finches that showed more nest-building behaviour but had lower levels of general activity, and they also observed these 'hosts' more frequently. If cuckoos choose to breed in habitats resembling those on which they were imprinted and search randomly for hosts in these habitats, they would increase their probability of parasitizing nests of their foster species. We propose that host specificity would be strengthened, however, if cuckoos use a sequence of several mechanisms, rather than just one, to find their hosts.

TI Honeybee navigation: odometry with monocular input

LA English

ID DISTANCE; ORIENTATION; VISION; DORSAL; EYE
AB Recent studies have revealed that navigating honeybees, Apis mellifera, estimate the distance to a food source by integrating over time the image motion that they experience en route. Here we examine the ability of honeybees to gauge distance travelled when visual input is available primarily to one eye. Bees were trained to fly into a tunnel, lined with textured patterns, to collect a reward at a feeder placed at a certain distance. Their ability to estimate distance flown was then assessed by testing them in ai fresh tunnel without the feeder. The results show that (1) bees can estimate distance flown under monocular conditions, performing nearly as accurately as when information is available to both eyes; (2) bees can learn to fly two: different distances, where each distance is measured in terms of the image motion experienced by a different eye; and (3) bees that have acquired. information on the distance to a food source using one eye can measure out the same distance when they are required to use the other (naive) eye. The need to measure distance using signals from a single eye becomes important when a bee flies to a food source along the face of a cliff or the edge of a forest. Furthermore, under such conditions, it is important to be able to deal with odometric signals that are transposed interocularly when the bee returns home from the food source. This is because, although distances are learnt primarily-bn the way to a food source, foraging bees monitor distance flown on the homebound as well as' the outbound routes.

AB I studied the relationship between the timing of birth relative to other births in the social group, and the rate of spatial integration into the herd in six cohorts of semi-free-ranging infant sable antelope at the National Zoological Park's Conservation and Research Center near Front Royal, Virginia. All calves spent the initial few days of life resting in seclusion ('hiding'), and interacted with mothers and other conspecifics only during activity bouts. With time, calves became increasingly likely to rest apart from the herd with other calves in creches, and by 6 weeks of age, calves remained with the herd throughout all resting and activity bouts. The rate of spatial integration for individual calves depended upon the calf's birth date and the availability of peers of similar age (birth clustering). Only the first few calves born in each cohort were observed in creches, and creche groups synchronized their entry into the herd. First-born calves remained in creches longer and began resting with the herd later in life than calves born later in the cohort. Last-born calves typically did not form creches, but instead rested with the herd from an early age. Other infants may;serve as social cover during the time that infants form creches and when they first begin to accompany the herd. The observed individual differences ii; the rate of spatial integration may represent individual adjustments in response to the varying degrees of protection offered by the spatial environment.

AB Absolute and masked auditory thresholds (critical masking ratios) were determined behaviourally in the great tit, Paras major, using a GO/NOGO-procedure. Absolute sensitivity was measured between 0.25 and 10 kHz. In the absence of noise, great tits were mast sensitive to frequencies between 2 and 4 kHz. In background noise, however, the sensitivity was only a function of the noise level and was independent of frequency. Critical masking ratios determined for signals between 0.25 and 8 kHz were almost constant (median values varied between 23.8 and 25.9 dB) irrespective of signal frequency. Therefore, in contrast to the majority of bird species, great tits have unusually low critical masking ratios at high frequencies. This means that great tits can use high-frequency vocalizations to communicate efficiently in noisy (i.e. natural) environments. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We studied olfactory preferences of two strains of mice, Mus musculus musculus and Mus musculus domesticus (considered here to be subspecies), and their hybrids, to examine the possible role of odours as a behavioural, premating mechanism that could explain the characteristics of their natural hybrid zone. We used a choice test with the bedding material of animals of the opposite sex from the animal tested and from both subspecies. Male and. female M. m. domesticus showed no preference either for their own subspecies' odours or for the other subspecies' odours. In contrast, M. m. musculus individuals and three types of hybrids (all the female hybrids and males from crosses between an M. m. musculus female and an M. m. domesticus male) sniffed for longer at materials from the musculus source than from the domesticus source. We interpreted the results asa preference for musculus odours. Differences between the two subspecies in their response towards consubspecific and heterosubspecific odours could explain the asymmetrical introgression observed in the hybrid zone.

AB Assessment of potentially asymmetrical characters (:such as fighting ability and resident advantage) is often important in determining the outcome of agonistic interactions. Loss of body parts, a predator defence mechanism used by many animals, may lead to a reduction in fighting ability and may be easily assessed by competitors. We investigated the influence of tail loss on the expression of agonistic behaviour in the territorial red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus. Residents and intruders were matched for body size, and pairs were tested in all combinations of tailed or tailless residents with tailed or tailless intruders. Neither residents nor intruders altered their behaviour based on their own tail condition, but they did alter their behaviour based on the tail condition of their opponents. Intruders showed more aggression or less submission towards tailless residents than towards tailed residents. When contests were between residents;Ind intruders of the same tail condition (both tailed or tailless), intruders were more aggressive towards residents when both were tailless than when both were tailed, indicating that tail loss does not directly hamper aggressive displays. In contests where the asymmetry between residents and intruders was small (based on tail condition and residency status), intruders showed more aggression and less submission than in contests where the asymmetry was large. Residents did not differ in their behaviour for most comparisons. Thus, for intruders, the tail condition of residents is an important determinant of agonistic behaviour displayed in territorial contests. For residents, factors other than tail condition (such as resource value) may be more likely to influence their behaviour. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We conducted three experiments to examine variables that might influence the longevity of socially induced food preferences in Norway rats. The duration of social influence on the food choices of 42-day-old rats (1) increased with both increasing numbers of demonstrators and increasing numbers of demonstrations by a single demonstrator, (2) varied with the temporal distribution of demonstrations, but (3) did not vary with the age of demonstrators. The results suggest that a single episode of social learning produces short-term, but not long-term, effects on a Norway rat's food choices.

AB Interest in the evolution of female mating preferences has increased greatly in recent years, and numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain how mating preferences evolve. Despite this interest, little is known about how selection acts on mating preferences in natural populations. One reason for this lack of information may be that experimental designs commonly used for testing female preferences make it difficult to quantify the preferences of individual females. Most commonly used designs share three features: they examine the preferences of populations of females, they test female responses when they are presented simultaneously with two stimuli, and they infer information on female preferences by observing female choices between alternative stimuli. Population-level choice tests, in which each female is tested only once with a set of stimuli, do not evaluate within-female variation in preference, which is necessary to document between-female variation in I,reference. Two-stimulus designs test only for directional preferences if female responses are tested with only a single pair of stimuli. In addition, dichotomous scoring of female responses makes detection of between-female variation in preference difficult. Simultaneous stimulus presentations can confound female preference and female sampling behaviour. An alternative method to assess female preferences is to measure repeatedly the preference functions of individual females using a single-stimulus design. The shape of a female's preference function indicates how a female's mating response varies with male trait value, and repeated measures of individual preference functions allow measurement of within-and between-female variation in preferences.

AB Previous work has shown that juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L, are predominantly nocturnal during winter (spending the day sheltering in streambed refuges) but become active 24 h a day in the summer. Observations of salmon in a semi-natural stream revealed how light, temperature and time of year determined these activity patterns; we also tested whether the life-history strategy of the fish affected diel activity, comparing fish that would migrate to sea the following spring with those that would be resident in fresh water for at least an additional year. Fish tended to hide at high light levels whenever the water was cold but were increasingly likely to emerge as the winter progressed. There were significant differences between the two groups of fish: the putative migrants sheltered more than the resident group in winter, but this trend was reversed in the spring. Reducing the risk of predation in winter may be one of the reasons for this seasonal change in behaviour. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI The influence of habitat and male morphology on a mate-choice cue: the
   display nests of wrens
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUAL SELECTION
AB Wrens, Troglodytes troglodytes, are highly polygynous passerines. Males build cock nests that are displayed to females and function as a mate-choice cue. Males with large numbers of nests are more likely to attract females than males with fewer nests. To be useful to females a cue used in mate choice must contain information. One way to evaluate the information content of such a cue may be to examine the factors that influence its size. The number of nests was Predicted on territories with known building rates (immigration) and nest destruction rates (death) using an immigration-death function. This analysis suggested that if only building rate and destruction rates were considered then the number of nests on territories was consistently overestimated. In 1994 an experiment was conducted in which nest-site availability was manipulated. Males provided with additional nest sites built more nests and continued to build later in the year resulting in longer nest-building periods than controls. The converse was found when nest sites were experimentally removed. This suggested that the number of nests that could be constructed on a territory was limited by habitat structure. None of the morphological characters considered here significantly influenced the number of nests built by males. Therefore, the information content of this mate-choice cue will be primarily about characteristics of the habitat on the territory rather than characteristics of the male.

AB The phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis states that functional male fertility covaries with male phenotype and that females engage in extra-pair copulations with males with more attractive phenotypes than their partner to obtain direct fertility benefits. We tested this idea in the sedge warbler, Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, a species in which females prefer males with larger song repertoires, and in which extra-pair copulations occur. In this study paired males had larger song repertoires than unpaired males. However, we found no significant relationships between song features and any measure of sperm numbers or sperm quality. We also examined the hypothesis that directional asymmetry in testes mass covaries with the expression of secondary sexual traits, such as song features, but again found no significant effects. However, older males tended to have larger repertoires and testes and a greater degree of directional asymmetry in testes size than young males.

TI Fission and troop size in a mountain baboon population
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID DEMOGRAPHY; LANGUAGE; MACAQUES; PRIMATES; URSINUS; MONKEY
AB Baboon, Papio cynocephalus, populations show a circumscribed range of troop sizes, dependent on features of the habitat that set limits on the ability of animals to balance their time budgets. To assess the proposal that a rising probability of troop fission is the mechanism underlying this it is first shown that (1) the distribution of troop sizes in two very different baboon populations, in the Drakensberg and at Amboseli, are not described by the null model of random allocation of individuals to troops (the Poisson process); and (2) data on troops undergoing or attempting fission support the hypothesis that the probability of fission increases with increasing troop size. A model was constructed that generated a distribution of troop size from an underlying, 'pre-fission' distribution by varying two parameters: the probability that a troop of given size will split, and the relative sizes of the two daughter troops that result if fission occurs. Both the Drakensberg and the Amboseli populations were adequately described by the model and it is concluded that the distribution of troop size in both populations is governed by fission in the manner proposed by Dunbar (1992, Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol., 33, 35-49). The model also indicates that, relative to Amboseli, the probability of fission in the Drakensberg is very high, with all troops of more than 28 members eventually splitting. The hypothesis that low food availability accelerates fission in mountain baboons through the decreased foraging efficiency of larger troops was tested, Troops of a wide range of sizes allocated very similar amounts of time to foraging, foraged with the same efficiency, and travelled approximately the same distances to do so. It is concluded that fission in mountain baboons, being exacerbated neither by predation nor by inefficient foraging, may be caused directly by the inability of individuals to service social relationships in growing troops in the face of small amounts of time available for social interaction.

TI Paedomorphosis affects agonistic visual signals of domestic dogs
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many of the structural modifications of modern breeds of domestic dog, Canis familiaris, can be explained by changes in the rate of development, during domestication from the wolf, C. lupus. These changes have been dominated by paedomorphosis, or underdevelopment, so that the adult passes through fewer growth stages and resembles a juvenile stage of its ancestor. In this paper the effects of these processes on the signalling ability of 10 breeds selected for their degree of physical dissimilarity to the wolf are examined. The number of ancestral dominant and submissive behaviour patterns used during signalling within single-breed groups ranged from two (Cavalier King Charles spaniel) to 15 (Siberian husky), and this correlated positively with the degree to which the breed physically resembles the wolf, as assessed by a panel of 14 dog behaviour counsellors. When the signals displayed by each breed were grouped according to the stage of wolf development in which they first appear, those breeds with the smallest repertoires were found to draw mast of their signals from those appearing before 20 days of age in the wolf, suggesting that physical paedomorphism has been accompanied by behavioural paedomorphism.

AB To quantify the success rates of defenders and intruders at a guarded resource and to examine how competitive tactics vary in relation to the number of potential intruders, individual giant danio fish, Danio aequipinnatus, were observed defending a concentrated, renewing food source from 1-20 smaller zebrafish, Danio (= Brachydanio) rerio. With increasing zebrafish numbers, the foraging success of giant danios continuously decreased, the foraging success of zebrafish first increased then decreased, and the proportion of time spent close to the food source sharply increased for both zebrafish and giant danios, reaching an asymptote at intermediate numbers of zebrafish. Defender chase rate per intruder was high when zebrafish numbers were low and continuously declined with increasing numbers of zebrafish; the total number of chases per minute peaked at intermediate zebrafish numbers. The median distance and speed of chases decreased as zebrafish numbers increased. Chases by giant danios and flights by zebrafish were similar in distance and speed, but the relative cost of flights was higher than that of chases because of the asymmetry in size between intruders and defenders. These observations support the hypotheses that resource-guarding success decreases and that the cost of guarding increases as intruder numbers increase. They also indicate that both defenders and intruders adjust their behaviour patterns to these benefits and costs, and that the quantitative relationship between intruder numbers and the success of defence is a result of these interactions.

AB The frequency of extra-pair paternity was determined in broods of the yellowhammer using single-locus DNA fingerprinting. Of 32 analysed clutches, 69% contained at least one extra-pair young. Out of 123 nestlings, 37% were extra-pair sired young. The extra-pair male could be assigned to 23 (50%) nestlings. Successful extra-pair males were all at least 3 years old although both younger and older males suffered from extra-pair paternity. Extra-pair males were also significantly more colourful than pair males, but did not differ in other characters. Colour did not differ between males with or without extra-pair young. The frequency of extra-pair young was not related to breeding density and identified extra-pair males were not necessarily nearest neighbours, giving further evidence that extra-pair males are not chosen at random. Since females do not obtain anything but sperm from extra-pair males, the results suggest that females prefer older and more colourful males, contributing good or attractive genes, as indicated by their plumage. Consequently, old, colourful extra-pair males, and possibly females, are likely to benefit from extra-pair copulations. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENT; STRATEGIES; DOMINANCE; FLOCKING; BEHAVIOR; SUCCESS
AB Social foragers obtain food through two tactics: 'producer' searches for its food, and 'scrounger' exploits food discovered by producer. In the recent literature, two alternative producer-scrounger (P-S) models have been proposed, one rate-maximizing, the other risk-sensitive. Their predictions differ about the effect of food clump density on the equilibrium proportional use of scrounger in a group. The rate-maximizing model predicts no effect, whereas the risk-sensitive model predicts that the proportional use of scrounger should increase with food clump density. These predictions were tested using wild-caught European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, in an indoor aviary. Increased food clump density resulted in significant increases in the proportional use of scrounger. Proportional use of scrounger was negatively related to food intake variance as assumed by the risk-sensitive model. Thus, scrounger is a risk-averse foraging tactic, and starlings used it in a risk-sensitive fashion. The risk-sensitive model was further challenged by testing its prediction concerning daily food requirement. When producer has a low competitive efficiency, as was found in these starlings, the risk-sensitive model predicts weakly positive effects, if any, of increased requirement on proportional use of scrounger. Results were consistent with this prediction. A significant number of starlings showed consistently positive effects of requirement on proportional use of scrounger, but the magnitude of this increase was non-significant. The results of both experiments taken together show that the proportional use of scrounger tactics within foraging groups may be a risk-sensitive, rather than a rate-maximizing, foraging tactic.

   AGGRESSION; SPARROWS; STRESS; WINTER
AB American black duck, Anas rubripes, populations are thought to be in decline largely because of competitive exclusion by mallards, A. platyrhynchos, and/or introgressive hybridization. Mallard males reportedly are behaviourally dominant to black duck males, which may allow mallards to acquire black duck females as mates and/or exclude black ducks from high-quality breeding sites. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of body size, body mass, degree of body symmetry and testosterone levels on dominance interactions between these two species, while controlling for effects of previous experience. Thirty dominance trials were performed in the winter and spring with groups of six males (three mallard and three black duck). Surprisingly, mallards were not generally dominant to black ducks. General linear model analyses revealed that morphological and hormonal variables were not consistently correlated with dominance, but place of origin and home pen dominance were. Pre-trial plasma testosterone concentration and change in testosterone concentration were significant effects in the winter trials, but in the opposite direction to that predicted. Size-adjusted body mass was correlated with dominance between Ontario mallards and wild-source black ducks in the spring. Dominance relationships between these two species are more complex than was originally thought. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The hand preferences of orang-utans have been studied to a lesser extent than those of the other great apes and there has been no previous investigation of free-ranging orang-utans. Left and right hand use by rehabilitated orang-utans living in their natural environment was scored during feeding and self-touching of the face, head and body. The scores were ranked according to three categories designating the degree of finger flexion and manipulation. A total of 43 subjects ranging in age from 1.5 to 28 years were scored, although the sample size varied for each condition. A significant left-hand preference within a subgroup of 31 subjects was found for scratching and for fine manipulation of parts of the face, the strength of this preference increasing with age. Left-hand preferences were present also for some of the categories of head and body touching, but not to the same degree as those for face touching. No group bias for either a left- or right-hand preference was found for hand use in feeding, although some individuals displayed significant left- or right-hand preferences for unimanual holding of food when in either the hanging or propped position and half of the subjects had a preferred hand for fine manipulation in bimanual feeding. Undifferentiated hand use during bimanual feeding was more characteristic of young orang-utans, and older females were more likely to have a right-hand preference. No hand preferences were found for touching conspecifics and sucking fingers or toes, but two out of four mothers displayed a preferred side for carrying the baby.

AB Alternate morphologies exist in a wide range of species. A commonly encountered dimorphism in insects is wing dimorphism, in which one morph is winged (macropterous=LW) and flight-capable while the other has reduced wings (micropterous=SW) and cannot fly. Gryllus firmus is a wing-dimorphic cricket found in the southeastern U.S.A. Although trade-offs associated with wing dimorphism are well established in female crickets, no such trade-offs have been demonstrated in male crickets. Differences between morphs in male G. firmus in the likelihood of attracting a female were tested in the laboratory using a simple T-maze where females chose between an LW male and an SW male. Time spent calling for each male was recorded on the sixth day of adult life. SW males were more likely to attract a female and spent more time calling than LW males. A logistic regression of female choice against the absolute proportional difference in calling time between males revealed that, as the difference in calling time between males increased, the likelihood of a female choosing the longer-calling male also increased. Therefore it is concluded that there is a trade-off between macroptery and the likelihood of attracting a female, and that it may be a primary factor in the maintenance of wing dimorphism in male G. firmus.

   GROWTH; PISCES
AB Genetic evidence has revealed that sexual fidelity is rather rare in supposedly monogamous animals. Pairing, whether sexually faithful or not, is very uncommon in fish and has not previously been confirmed in fish from seagrass habitats. Here, the first underwater study of seahorse reproduction reveals that males and females of an Australian species (Hippocampus whitei) form pairs that mate repeatedly and exclusively. Partners greet each other daily and eschew interactions with non-partners. Seahorses are unusual in that both sexes provide clear visual evidence of having mated (the male becomes pregnant as the female transfers hydrated eggs) allowing confidence that these fish are sexually faithful to one another. Pairs do not divorce and a pair bond only terminates when one partner disappears. Intra-sexual competition appears not to be important in maintaining pair bonds.

ID SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION; SOUTHWESTERN KENYA; SPOTTED HYAENAS; LIONS;
   SUCCESS; PREY
AB African wild dogs are 20-25 kg social carnivores whose major prey are ungulates ranging from 15 to 200 kg. In the Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania, wild dog pack size ranged from three to 20 adults (3-44 including yearlings and pups). Data from 905 hunts and 404 kills showed that hunting success, prey mass and the probability of multiple kills increased with number of adults. Chase distance decreased with number of adults. None the less, the distribution of per capita food intake across adult pack size was U-shaped, with a minimum close to the modal pack size. A similar result has been used to conclude that cooperative hunting does not favour sociality in lions (Packer et al. 1990, Am. Nat., 136, 1-19), and to argue that cooperative hunting is not responsible for group living in any carnivore (Care 1994, Cheetahs of the Serengeti Plains: Group Living in an Asocial Species). Daily per capita food intake only accounts for variation in the benefits to cooperative hunting, ignoring variation in costs. For Selous wild dogs, per capita food intake per km chased peaked close to the modal adult pack size (where per capita food intake per day was near its minimum). Thus, the energetics of cooperative hunting favour sociality in Selous wild dogs. Analyses that incorporate Variation in both costs and benefits of hunting may show that cooperative hunting favours sociality in other species where its influence has previously been rejected.

AB DNA fingerprinting was used to determine the proportion of extra-pair young in a population of barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, breeding in the Baltic area, Sweden. Of 137 analysed fledged young 17% were found to be extra-pair young. One or more extra-pair young were found in 27% of the 63 analysed families. The proportion of extra-pair young differed between years. No case of extra-pair fertilization was detected. All extra-pair young at fledging originated either from intraspecific nest parasitism or from adoptions of foreign hatched young. Broods with extra-pair young at fledging were significantly larger than broods without extra-pair young. However, the number of within-pair young did not differ significantly in broods with and without extra-pair young. Body mass, survival or subsequent reproductive performance did not differ between parents with and without extra-pair fledged young. Post-fledging survival and age at first breeding were not significantly different between the three analysed classes of fledged young, i.e. within-pair young in families without extra-pair young, within-pair young in families with at least one extra-pair young, and extra-pair young. It is concluded that possible costs or benefits associated with caring for extra-pair fledged young are small or absent in this population. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

DT Article
ID HYENA CROCUTA-CROCUTA; MATERNAL RANK; DOMINANCE; ORGANIZATION; ONTOGENY
AB Spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, live in clans characterized by a matrilineal social system, with female dominance over males. As part of an ongoing study of the development of hyaena social behaviour, the 'de novo' emergence of a natural social system was documented in captive groups of peer-reared hyaenas that had not acquired their mother's rank prior to removal to a captive situation. The acquisition of rank in their descendants was examined. Dominance relationships were studied in six breeding groups using competitive feeding tests administered in different social contexts. Founding members of these groups had been collected in Africa as infants (<2 months of age) and reared in peer groups from the time of collection. Although female dominance was not evident in groups of peer-reared animals prior to sexual maturity, a natural matrilineal social system emerged in groups of peer-reared animals with their offspring. Juvenile hyaenas acquired ranks adjacent to those of their mothers, dominating much larger adults that were lower in rank than the juveniles' mothers, including the adult males. Group dominance relationships persisted during competitive tests with mothers removed, or with all adults removed, and during dyadic tests. Despite differences in group composition and in the social experience of mothers, a matrilineal social organization clearly emerged in the captive breeding groups of spotted hyaenas and their cubs. The acquisition of matrilineal rank among the offspring of peer-reared hyaenas, as well as among the offspring reared with mothers who had themselves acquired matrilineal rank as juveniles, suggests that matrilineal rank acquisition may be an inherent outcome of relationships generated between mother-offspring units and other group members, independent of a mother's degree of experience in a matrilineal social environment.

AB In the marine fish, Pomatoschistus microps, the common goby, males build nests, attract females to the nest to spawn, and guard the eggs until hatching. Males, too small to compete successfully for nest sites and mates, act as sneakers, enter other males' nests during spawning, and presumably fertilize some of the eggs. Sneaking behaviour changed in several aspects in the presence of predators (sea scorpions, Myoxocephalus scorpius) compared with in their absence; the number of 'inspection' approaches to the nest decreased, as well as the number of attempts to enter the nest. Number of intrusions also tended to decrease, but not significantly so. Nest owners frequently chased and attacked sneakers. Number of attacks was correlated with the other male's behaviour, both in the absence and in the presence of predators. Without predation risk, the number of nest approaches by the second male was of most importance for number of attacks, but in the presence of predators, the number of entering attempts was the factor that best explained the nest owner's attack rate. Thus, both nest owners and sneakers modify their behaviour in order to decrease the risks of being eaten. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ID JUVENILE RANK RELATIONS; DOMINANCE; AGGRESSION; PATTERNS; ONTOGENY; PLAY
AB The development of intra-litter competition and cooperation is described in free-living and captive spotted hyaenas. Field data were collected on dominance relations in 26 twin litters, and additional behavioural analyses were performed on different subsets of this group. Intra-litter dominance relations were assessed on the basis of the direction of aggressive and appeasement behaviour patterns. In all wild litters, one cub clearly dominated the other by the time cubs were observed above-ground, at 2-3 weeks of age. Within the 17 twin litters of mixed sex, female dominance over male litter-mates was significantly more common (N=14) than the reverse (N=3). When males were the dominant litter-mates, they were as aggressive towards their siblings as were females. Rates of intra-litter aggression were highest in the youngest age interval observed (1-2 months), and dropped significantly the next month. Peak monthly rates of intra-litter aggression correlated significantly with maternal rank, such that offspring of low-ranking females fought more than those of high-ranking females. High levels of intra-litter cooperation were observed in the context of coalition formation, and youngsters affiliated more with litter-mates than with any other hyaena. In captivity, seven twin and two triplet litters were videotaped during the first 2 months of life, and were scored for aggressive interactions. Results showed that dominance between litter-mates is established as early in development as the first day of life. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Attempts by males of the solitary bee Anthophora plumipes Pallas (Apoidea: Anthophoridae) to mate with foraging females at flowers of comfrey, Symphytum orientale, were studied. The mating system conformed to scramble competition polygyny. After an initial period of nectar foraging in the morning, males patrolled the comfrey and attempted to copulate with any females they encountered. The majority of females were unreceptive, and were able to reject the male after his initial pounce, which knocked the female to the ground. Females could experience rates of attempted copulation exceeding once every 3 s, which significantly reduced their rate of visiting flowers and hence prolonged the period required to provision nest cells. Females responded to male harassment by evasive flight and physical repulsion and also by a more general change in foraging behaviour. Females abandoned flowers on the outer parts of plants frequented by males, and foraged from flowers inside the plant's growth where males did not often venture. Consideration of sugar rewards per flower and handling times suggested that male harassment halved the rate of reward for females from exposed outer flowers. When males were removed from the site, females abandoned the inner flowers and foraged from more profitable outer flowers. When males were released, the original pattern of behaviour was quickly re-established. During poor weather the ability of females to provision cells became marginal, and male harassment could thus have significant consequences for female fitness.

AB Female brook sticklebacks develop distinct nuptial coloration following ovulation. When given a choice between a gravid, uncoloured, inter-spawning interval female and a gravid, nuptially coloured female, male brook sticklebacks from two Ontario populations (1) approached the nuptially coloured female first, (2) directed their first courtship pummel towards her, and (3) spent significantly more time with her than with the inter-spawning interval female. Males from Tooley Creek spent more of their time near the nuptially coloured female engaged in courtship behaviour and more of their time near the inter-spawning interval female engaged in aggressive behaviour. Males from Algonquin Park showed no difference in the intensity of courtship or aggression directed towards the two females. These results corroborate the hypothesis that female nuptial coloration plays a role in signalling courtship readiness in at least some gasterosteids. The hypothesis that males should become more discriminating in their choice of spawning partners as they increase their parental investment was tested by comparing male mate choice based upon female colour for males with no eggs, one clutch and two clutches. The results corroborated the hypothesis: compared to when they were eggless, males with two clutches (1) spent less time with the inter-spawning interval female, (2) spent more time with the nuptially coloured female, (3) spent a greater proportion of the time near the nuptially coloured female engaged in courtship behaviour, and (4) displayed a trend towards increasing levels of aggression directed towards the inter-spawning interval female with increasing parental investment.

AB There is no general theory of cache dispersal in food-storing animals. The present study of free-ranging black-capped chickadees, Parus atricapillus, was undertaken to determine whether caches were deployed in ways that might reduce the overall memory load required for cache recovery. Birds were studied in natural habitats of New York state's Hudson Valley during the time of the year when they lived in flocks. Birds were offered sunflower seeds at feeders during the autumn and winter. Storing flights ended usually at short distances from the feeder and tended to cluster around a preferred orientation. This orientation often persisted on subsequent days and overlapped with that of other flock members. The behaviour observed may reflect a compromise between the need to minimize the energy cost for food storing (dose to source), to minimize the risk of thievery (scatter-hoarding), and to optimize the memorization of caching sites. One hypothesis offered to explain this behaviour is that cached sites clustered in a particular direction will be remembered with reference to a common set of landmarks, and thus pose less of a memory load than items cached over a broad area using all directions away from a food source.

TI TRANSFER EXPERIMENTS OF SEYCHELLES WARBLERS TO NEW ISLANDS - CHANGES IN
   DISPERSAL AND HELPING-BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID DELAYED DISPERSAL; MODEL; WRENS
AB Young of the cooperatively breeding Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis, frequently remain on their natal territories and act as helpers. Independent reproduction may be constrained by habitat saturation (a shortage of breeding territories) or, alternatively, individuals on good territories may achieve higher fitness by staying and helping than by dispersing and breeding on inferior territories. Transfers of warblers to unoccupied islands showed that both habitat saturation and variation in territory quality dramatically affected the frequency of delayed dispersal. At first there was no cooperative breeding, but as all high-quality areas became occupied, young birds hatched on them began to stay as helpers, rather than occupy breeding vacancies on lower quality territories. However, as the number of helpers on high-quality territories increased, thereby reducing the helper's indirect component of inclusive fitness benefits from staying at home, it paid some helpers to leave, even to poor territories. Thereafter, young reared on poor territories did better to leave to breed on poor territories, rather than stay at home.

TI SONG TUTOR CHOICE BY ZEBRA FINCHES IN AVIARIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA; SELECTION; FATHERS
AB The social interactions and song learning of young male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were studied in two aviaries, each containing four breeding pairs and several other adult males. Half of the adults were of the fawn morph and half of the chestnut-flanked white. Seventeen young males were reared, and each tended to learn most of its song from one adult. They showed a strong tendency to learn song elements from males of the same morph as their father and, within that morph, the father tended to be the preferred tutor. Most learnt from the male with which they maintained greatest proximity. No relationship was found between song learning and the song length or singing rate of individual adults, or with various aspects of social behaviour, such as allopreening or aggression. No young bird was seen to be fed by an adult other than one of its parents; most of the young continued to associate more with their siblings than with other juveniles after independence, and there was some evidence that siblings that associated most closely developed most similar song characteristics. Differences in social relationships and in song learning from some earlier studies may stem from the greater space available in the aviaries used here.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID RANGING RHESUS-MONKEYS; BEHAVIOR; ANXIETY
AB Forty mother-infant dyads of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, living in a confined group were observed throughout the first 12 weeks of the infants' lives to identify the sources of variation in mother-infant relationships. To summarize mother and infant behaviour in a few basic behavioural dimensions, a multivariate analysis was employed. Principal component analysis extracted three factors that were labelled Infant Activity, Maternal Protectiveness and Maternal Rejection. Mother's age and matriline size both affected the quality of the mother-infant relationship. Older mothers were less protective towards their infants and mothers belonging to larger matrilines showed a higher frequency of rejection. Maternal experience had a minor influence on mother-infant relationships, whereas infant sex, maternal dominance rank, and the number of immature offspring present in the group had no effect on mother-infant relationships. In spite of the large number of variables investigated, the attributes of the mother-infant pair explained only a limited proportion of variation in the sample. A possible reason is that the mother's emotional reactivity, a variable not considered in this study, is a major factor in shaping monkey maternal behaviour.

ID HONEY BEES; NECTAR
AB The classification of food items into a selected set of categories can significantly enhance information processing by a foraging animal. The ability of bumblebees, Bombus flavifrons, to form simple categories of floral colours was tested. Bees recognized categories in a way that enhanced their ability to discriminate between rewarding and non-rewarding flowers. Bees also recognized novel members of learned categories. Both memorization and generalization based on similarity between floral types could be ruled out as the mechanisms underlying bees' behaviour. It is most likely that bees learned to attend to the stimulus that reliably identified members of a certain category; a similar mechanism may be commonly used by many other species including humans.

   (ASTEROCAMPA-LEILIA, NYMPHALIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPERATURE REGULATION; TERRITORIAL; LEPIDOPTERA; LIGHT
AB The thermal environment may constrain the evolution of mating behaviour of ectothermal organisms. This study evaluates the impact of the thermal environment on the behaviour of male insects waiting for females at encounter sites. In the morning, males of the desert hackberry butterfly, Asterocampa leilia, perch and wait for females on or adjacent to the larval foodplant. Over the course of a morning as temperature increases, male body posture (wing position and orientation to sun) and perch preferences (perch height and perch insolation) change. The results show that the body temperature of males at perch sites is largely independent of air temperature (i.e. they thermoregulate) and the body posture and perch preferences change with air temperature. Observations on thermocouple-implanted models indicate that the observed changes in behaviour lead to decreases in operative thoracic temperature. The results indicate that changes in wing position, perch height preferences, and insolation preferences have adaptive thermal consequences that may constrain mate detection.

ID MIGRATION; ZOOPLANKTON; CLADOCERAN
AB The effects of predator-conditioned water on two Daphnia behaviour patterns, vertical migration and polarotactic orientation in the horizontal plane, were tested using several clones of both D. longispina and D. magna. The smaller D. longispina showed statistically significant reductions in polarotactic orientation in invertebrate-conditioned water, while the larger D. magna responded only to fish-conditioned water with changes in vertical migration behaviour. The extent of the behavioural reaction to predator chemical cues is related to the level of predatory pressure in the ponds from which the clones came: the more predator species in a pond, the more likely a clone was to be responsive to chemical cues.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PLUMAGE POLYMORPHISM; AGGRESSION; MORPHS
AB White-throated sparrows are dimorphic, mating disassortatively by morph. In laboratory choice trials, females of both morphs preferred tan-striped males when allowed to interact with males (two-way choice), but displayed no preferences when one-way mirrors did not allow stimulus males to interact with them (one-way choice). Males of both morphs displayed significant preferences for white-striped females in one-way choice trials, but not in two-way trials. During within-sex competition trials, white-striped birds were dominant to tan-striped birds of the same sex. These results suggest that negative assortative mating is maintained in part because white-striped females outcompete tan-striped females for access to the preferred tan-striped males. Tan-striped females then pair with the less preferred white-striped males. A three-step process is proposed to account for the high level of negative assortative mating seen in the white-throated sparrow.

TI SYMMETRICAL ASSESSMENT OF FEMALE QUALITY BY MALE GAMMARUS-PULEX
   (AMPHIPODA) DURING STRUGGLES OVER PRECOPULA FEMALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Single male Gammarus pulex often attempt to take over females held in precopula by other males. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the role of assessment by males of relative resource-holding potential and resource value (female quality) in determining decisions during struggles. In the first, single males were presented with precopule pairs, the females of which varied considerably in fecundity and proximity to moult (and hence time to copulation). In the second, variation in female reproductive quality was reduced by staging stuggles over recently moulted females. During encounters, intruding males assessed female quality rapidly and accurately; the persistence of take-over attempts increased as time to female moult decreased (experiment 1) and as female size increased (experiment 2). The relative size of contestants did not influence the structure or duration of struggles, indicating that males do not assess relative resource-holding potential directly. Rather, as the absolute size of intruding males increased, take-over attempts became more vigorous in terms of the time spent in struggles and the number of tugs at females. Take-overs occurred when defending males were small relative to intruding males and small relative to their female partners. These results are discussed in the context of assessment strategies in general and Gammarus mating decisions in particular.

TI PARENT OFFSPRING CONFLICT RELATIVE TO PHASE OF LACTATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Weaning conflict in captive collared peccaries, Tayassu tajacu, was examined to test whether the highest proximate conflict occurs near the termination of lactation or near the mid-lactational decline in milk production. Since the frequency of conflict behaviour might be related to the condition of the nursing female, the subjects were placed on two dietary treatments corresponding to protein availability typical of conditions of drought (7.5%) and high rainfall (16.5%). Data were analysed  within three developmental phases: milk dependency (1-7 weeks), transition (7-15 weeks) and terminal (15-36 weeks). Nursing females did not take an active role in interrupting nursing bouts; in all but one phase (transition phase on low protein diet), nursing females interrupted less than half the suckling bouts. Three of four measures of conflict did not differ relative to phase of lactation analysed within diets. On the low protein diet, juveniles persisted at initiating unsuccessful attempts  more frequently in the third phase. Within each phase, measures of conflict were more frequent on the low protein diet than on the high protein diet. Juvenile persistence was a more sensitive indicator of conflict than nurser interruptions. Nutritional condition appears to be an important factor modifying the expression of parent-offspring conflict.

TI INDIVIDUALLY DISTINCT VOCALIZATIONS IN TIMBER WOLVES, CANIS-LUPUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Howls were recorded from seven captive wolves temporarily individually isolated from their pack-mates. Sound spectrograms of these recordings were then digitized and 14 variables were measured and subjected to multivariate statistical analyses. Both principal components analysis and discriminant analysis indicated that individuals could be reliably discriminated primarily on the basis of the fundamental frequency of howls and the variability of frequency within howls. The significance of the  presence of vocal signatures in this long distance vocalization is discussed in the context of wolf social organization.

AB The level of predatory threat encountered by fish may vary from population to population. In Trinidad, for example, guppies in Lower Aripo River encounter a range of fish predators. Guppies from the Paria River, by contrast, encounter few fish predators but probably experience a high degree of predation from freshwater prawns, Macrobrachium spp. Predation risk from all types of aquatic predators is low for guppies from the Upper Aripo River. Inspection behaviour allows prey fish to recognize and assess potential predators. The risk associated with this behaviour can be minimized if the attack cone around the predator''s jaw is avoided. This experiment investigated attack-cone avoidance behaviour during inspection of either a fish predator, Rivulus hartii or a macrobrachium, M. crenulatum, by wildcaught guppies. Inspecting Lower Aripo guppies kept a large distance between themselves and the rivulus. They also selectively avoided the dangerous mouth region. These Lower Aripo guppies did not, however, display attack-cone avoidance in the presence of the macrobrachium. Guppies from the Paria population were most wary when inspecting the macrobrachium. Upper Aripo guppies showed no attack-cone avoidance and displayed poor recognition of both predators. The results demonstrate that fish skilled at dealing with one type of predator gain no automatic advantage when faced with a novel predator. They also show that fish exposed to high levels of  predation in the wild will not necessarily be more cautious in circumstances where the level of danger is unknown.

TI THE TALE OF THE SCREAMING HAIRY ARMADILLO, THE GUINEA-PIG AND THE
   MARGINAL VALUE THEOREM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Foraging by screaming hairy armadillos, Chaetophractus vellerosus, and guinea pigs, Cavia porcellus, was studied in the laboratory. The main question was whether patch exploitation varies with overall capture rate as predicted by the marginal value theorem (MVT). Armadillos in experiment I and guinea pigs in experiment I and guinea pigs in experiment II experienced a single travel time between depleting patches of two kinds: goods and poor. There were two treatments, which differed in the  quality of poor patches. MVT predicts that within a treatment, more prey should be taken from good than from poor patches and between treatments, good patches should be exploited in direct relation to their own quality. In experiment III, guinea pigs experienced three treatments which differed in the travel requirement, while the two patch types remained the same. MVT predicts that within a treatment more prey should be taken from good than from poor patches and that between treatments more  prey should be taken from both patch types as travel requirement increases. The qualitative predictions were supported in the three experiments. The quantitative fit was good but there was a bias towards more severe patch exploitation than predicted. The results indicate that in these species patch exploitation depends on overall food availability as predicted by the MVT when overall food availability differs either because of patch type composition or because of differences in travel requirement between patches.

TI ROLES OF VOMERONASAL ORGAN CHEMORECEPTION IN TONGUE FLICKING,
   EXPLORATORY AND FEEDING-BEHAVIOR OF THE LIZARD, CHALCIDES-OCELLATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A correlation between elevated tongue flick rate and vomeronasal organ use has frequently formed the basis for studies of lizard chemosensory behaviour, although this hypothesis has not been tested directly. The relationship between vomeronasal organ use and tongue flick rate was investigated by testing ocellated skinks, Chalcides ocellatus, with normal or sealed vomeronasal ducts (which prevents chemical access to the vomeronasal organ) in a novel environment, and in their home boxes.  Lizards with normal vomeronasal organs exhibited higher tongue flick rates in novel environments than in their home boxes. Lizards with sealed vomeronasal ducts exhibited significantly lower tongue flick rates than did lizards with normal vomeronasal organs, and did not demonstrate elevated tongue flick rates relative to home box levels in response to the novel environment. Therefore, elevation of tongue flick rates in response to environmental stimuli appears to be dependent on a functional vomeronasal organ. However, sealing the vomeronasal ducts did not prevent an increase in movement in novel environments relative to home boxes indicating that detection of novel stimuli and resulting exploratory behaviour do not require a functional vomeronasal organ. Prey consumption, but not prey attack, was severely impaired in lizards with sealed vomeronasal ducts, suggesting that vomeronasal system identification of objects that are attacked is important for completion of predatory  sequences.

TI FEMALE CHOICE INCREASES FERTILIZATION SUCCESS IN THE AUSTRALIAN FROG,
   UPEROLEIA-LAEVIGATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of the Australian frog, Uperoleia laevigata (formerly referred to as U. rugosa), compete intensively for opportunities to attract and mate with females, but it is active female choice that determines which of these males are successful. Females select mates that are about 70% of their own body weight, choosing on the basis of the males'' calls. Females offered a choice of two synthetic calls approached the call with a dominant frequency equivalent to a male 70% of their body weight in preference to calls equivalent to heavier or lighter males. Artifical pairing of males and females showed that this choice is adaptive as only females mating with males that were 64-80% of their body weight had most of their clutch fertilized. Heavier males hamper oviposition and lighter males may have insufficient sperm to fertilize the whole clutch.

TI KLEPTOPARASITISM AS A PROBLEM OF PREY CHOICE - A STUDY ON
   MUDFLAT-FEEDING CURLEWS, NUMENIUS-ARQUATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Curlews feeding on intertidal flats attacked mainly conspecifics for prey, whereas they themselves also fell victim to kleptoparasitic attacks from gulls. There is no convincing evidence that robbers obtained other benefits, such as access to a good feeding site, besides the stolen prey itself. The data are consistent with the view that kleptoparasitism should be treated as a problem of prey choice, where attacks are initiated so as to maximize the net rate of energy gain. Attacks were directed mainly towards conspecifics handlings large prey animals. There was no evidence of a simple producer-scrounger dichotomy. Instead, a dominance hierarchy seems more likely, where each individual could initiate attacks, but did so predominantly towards subdominant individuals, according to immediate profitability.

TI A VETO GAME PLAYED BY BABOONS - A CHALLENGE TO THE USE OF THE
   PRISONERS-DILEMMA AS A PARADIGM FOR RECIPROCITY AND COOPERATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB According to a widely accepted paradigm, cooperation among animals resembles an iterated, two-player Prisoner''s Dilemma game. In this symmetrical game the two players have equivalent strategic options. Decisions are based only on information obtained in similar interactions with the same player in the past. The Prisoner''s Dilemma model ignores the social organization within which cooperation occurs. This paper advocates a set of alternative models based on N-player coalition games that apply especially to collaboration (that is, cooperation and reciprocity) within social groups. The model takes into account the effect of competition for the favours of suitable partners. In Coalition games negotiations are possible and the strategic options of the players can be unequal. An example of a Coalition game, the Veto game, is illustrated by patterns of coalition formation among adult males in a group of wild baboons Papio c. cynocephalus.

TI THE GOOD PARENT PROCESS OF SEXUAL SELECTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two general processes have been proposed to explain the evolution of epigamic traits (i.e. secondary sexual characteristics that evolve in response to mate choice). The good genes process maintains that epigamic traits may be used to assess the genetic quality of potential mates. The Fisherian process maintains that these traits can evolve without any effect beyond conferring sexual attractiveness to the bearer. A third process leading to the evolution of epigamic traits is presented here: the  good parent process. Epigamic traits arise through this process by clarifying the differences in non-heritable parental quality among potential mates. The good parent process is validated by a haploid population genetic model, which further suggests that increases in the frequency of good fathers in the population and phenotypic plasticity of the trait enhance the evolution of a good parent trait. Species in which this process should be active can be identified, and data from natural  populations can falsify or support the hypothesis that the good parent process dominated in the evolution of a particular epigamic trait. The three processes of epigamic trait evolution are not mutually exclusive. They may all occur in nature with different frequencies and intensities.

Two days later, a juvenile immigrant of the same sex had replaced each removed bird. When the adults were set free again in their respective territories, aggression against newcomers, especially from juvenile males, rose significantly. From 1 to 4 days after the adults returned, the newcomers left their respective flocks  and resumed their roaming. The results show that floaters were present and that resident juvenile males prevented them from attending intact flocks.

TI INDIVIDUAL FOOTDRUMMING SIGNATURES IN BANNER-TAILED KANGAROO RATS
   DIPODOMYS-SPECTABILIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Footdrumming of 35 individual banner-tailed kangaroo rats was recorded in their territories in south-eatern Arizona in years of both high and low population densities. Analyses revealed that rats create individually distinct footdrumming signals by varying the number of footdrums in the first footroll and the number of footrolls in a sequence. These signals remain constant within individuals over time and do not vary with either age or sex. The footdrumming patterns, therefore, have the  acoustical properites necessary for communicating neighbour recognition: signals vary between different individuals but remain constant within the same individual. In contrast, footdrumming rates (footdrums/s) are higher in young adults than in juveniles and older adults, and males drum at higher rates than females. These results suggest that footdrumming rate could communicate age, sex or vitality. Because footdrumming patterns of close neighbours diverge in high, but not in low, population  densities, individually distinct footdrumming patterns among neighbours may be especially important to territorial defence when rats live near large numbers of close neighbours.

TI INTRASEXUAL COMPETITION AND THE MATING SYSTEM IN PRIMARILY MONOGAMOUS
   BIRDS - THE CASE OF THE SONG SPARROW
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study focuses on the effect of intrasexual competition in each sex and its role in the occurrence of polygyny in a primarily monogamus song sparrow, Melospiza melodia, population. Polygyny resulted after males annexed neighbouring territories and after floating females settled on the territories of incubating females. Polygynous males raised more young than monogamous males. Females in polygynous groups often raised young without the aid of a male and consequently raised fewer young than  monogamous or male-aided females. Two-year-old males were most likely to become polygynous, but the reverse was found for females, suggesting that age-related differences in competitive ability influenced the observed pattern of matings. Added supplemental food on 15 territories resulted in a reduction in foraging time, an increase in body mass and a greater portion of the time budget spent in surveillance for floaters by both males and females. Floaters settled on control territories more  often than expected, even though reproductive success was four times higher on experimental territories, as expected if a territory owner''s ability to engage in territory defence affects the likelihood of polygyny. Models that emphasize the role of female choice over that of female competition for resources that limit reproduction predict that females settle where they are most likely to maximize their reproductive success. Monogamy is probably the most frequent mating association in this  population because males are usually unable to defend the territory of more than one female, and because territorial females are usually able to prevent settlement by floating females.

DT Article
AB A series of experiments was designed to elucidate the underlying bases of the signatures by which littermate A. cahirinus are discriminated from unfamiliar age-mates. When observed in groups of four animals each, unfamiliar non-kin that had been fed the same distinctively flavoured diet interacted more frequently than those fed different diets. Observed frequencies of dyadic pairing were similar among non-kin fed the same diet versus littermates that had been separated and maintained on  different diets; however, frequencies of dyadic pairings by both of these classes of age-mates were significantly greater than pairings by non-kin fed opposite diets. Littermates that were directly familiar with one another and also ate the same diet huddled together more often than did animals that had either been raised together or ate the same diet. These data, in conjunction with previous related research, suggest that diet and genotype contribute additively to the phenotypic signatures  mediating social recognition in A. cahirinus.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations were made of social and territorial behaviour in a wild high-density population of Mongolian gerbils. The social units were multi-male, multi-female age-structured groups, judged to be families. The operational sex ratio was male biased. Group size varied from two to about 17 animals. Non-overlapping territories were defined by a clustered distribution of burrows, by common areas of activity of group members, and by chases across border zones between the areas used by each group. Territory size was correlated with group size, and ranged from 325 to 1550 M2. Within groups, differential social status was indicated by behaviour patterns of dominant as well a subordinate character. Larger individuals dominated smaller ones, and males usually dominated females. Males ranged more widely and they were generally more active than females. The rate of sexual maturation in subadults varied according to group composition. Mainly the largest reproductively active males defended the territories by chasing, and also by marking along borders. An increased marking rate was observed in reproductively active males and females during oestrus. Three females were observed to copulate, two with more than one male. One female preferentially copulated with a neighbouring male. The functions of territorial defence, marking behaviour and promiscuous mating are discussed, and some cross-species comparisons are made. The present observations are to a large extent compatible with the results of relevant laboratory and seminatural studies.

TI PLANT-DESIGN AND NON-RANDOM FORAGING BY ANTS ON CROTON-BONPLANDIANUM
   BAILL (EUPHORBIACEAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Croton bonplandianum bears female flowers in inflorescences which are arranged in a regular pattern. Foraging individuals of the ant Camponotus sericius feed on the nectar in the nectary glands of female flowers. The pattern of movement of ants while foraging between these regularly placed inflorescences was highly systematic and distinctly exploratory. The ants tended to visit new inflorescences at each move and avoided revisting inflorescences. They followed this foraging pattern by adopting circular movements either to the left or to the right and avoiding other complex but equally effective moves. This was probably due to memory constraints. The ants predicted the resource quality of the subset of a patch by sampling a part of it. The inflorescences within a cluster were similar in quality. Using this relation ants could make decisions about continuing to forage in a cluster after sampling any one inflorescence. If the first inflorescence visited was of good quality they continued to forage on the rest of the cluster, while if the first inflorescence was of poor quality they abandoned the cluster. This ensured efficient foraging with minimal expenditure of time and energy.

TI INTRASPECIFIC NEST PARASITISM IN THE EUROPEAN STARLING STURNUS-VULGARIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Biochemical genetic markers were used along with conventional methods (abnormal laying sequence/clutch size, unusual egg shape/pigmentation) to identify intraspecific nest parasitism at two British nestbox colonies of the European starling. Between 11 and 37% of first clutches were parasitized during 1977-1979. Parasitic females probably comprised all of the following categories: (1) paired females contesting a nextbox occupied by another pair; (2) previously paired females who had laid a clutch but had been unsuccessful; (3) unpaired females who had copulated with males that already had a mate and nest site; and (4) ''professional'' nest parasites who distributed at least some of their eggs in one or more nests other than their own. Although parasitized nests had higher clutch sizes, parasitism led to fewer host young fledging per egg laid, mainly through the eviction of eggs and subsequent nest desertion. Number of parasitic young fledged per egg laid was highest when eggs were laid synchronously with the host, when host clutches were larger, or a smaller number of parasitic eggs were added to a nest, thus favouring parasites that distribute their eggs amongst a number of nests. A greater pressure on nest sites may have accounted for the higher levels of parasitism at the Aberdeen colony and for the greater number of parasite eggs laid in a nest. Although most parasitic female starlings appeared to be much less successful than nonparasitic ones, nest parasitism in the starling might evolve directly when one more of the following advantages are present. (1) There are no constraints on the number of eggs a female may lay but there are constraints on the number of young she may feed adequately. (2) Female survival is increased by having fewer or no eggs/young to care for. (3) Current feeding conditions favour the survival of more young than would be produced by the most common clutch size. Intraspecific nest parasitism is considered to be a first stage in the evolution of interspecific nest parasitism.

TI MATERNAL TIME BUDGETS OF GELADA BABOONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Data from gelada baboons, Theropithecus gelada, were used to evaluate Altmann''s (1980) model of maternal time budgets. The results provide substantial confirmation of the model''s general principles: the time that a female devoted to feeding increased with the age of her infant roughly in line with the model''s predictions. However, the rate of increase in feeding time was influenced both by environmental factors affecting the nutritional quality of the herbage and by the infant''s own feeding activities. The results suggest that Altmann''s assumption that the additional demand for feeding time is taken out of social time is only partially correct: in fact, social time was conserved as far as possible, with extra feeding time being taken out of resting time initially. Only when the demand for feeding time was so high that much of the available resting time was used up would the female release some of her social time. Evidence is presented to show that when females do give up social time, they seek to preserve those social relationships that are most important to their long-term reproductive interests.

TI THE EVOLUTIONARY IMPORTANCE OF BEHAVIORAL-DEVELOPMENT - THE ONTOGENY AND
   PHYLOGENY OF BIRD SONG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It has been proposed that ontogeny may be an important constraint on the evolution of morphological traits. In this paper, ontogeny is discussed as a possible constraint on behavioural evolution. A literature review of the development of song is oscine birds (Passeriformes; Passeres) shows that song development follows von Baer''s law; that is, that development proceeds from early, generally distributed stages to later, specialized stages. Song ontogeny is found to parallel phylogeny in a  lineage of sparrows (Emberizidae; Emberizinae). Possible cases of paedomorphosis (slowing down or truncation of development) in bird song are discussed, specifically in the family Mimidae and in the reed warbler, Acrocephalus palustris (Muscicapidae; Sylviinae). Finally, the implications of developmental constraints for the study of the adaptive significance of behaviour are discussed.

TI LOCATABILITY OF BEGGING CALLS IN NESTLING ALTRICIAL BIRDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Nestling begging calls of altricial species of birds have design features (wide frequency range, abrupt onsets and modulation in amplitude and frequency) that make them easily located by birds and mammals, and so may attract predators to the nest. To be maintained by natural selection, such calls must also be beneficial. It is argued here that sibling competition for food during the early stages of nestling development favours locatability of begging calls, presumably because noisy nestlings attract the attention of parents. In the magpie, Pica pica, begging calls of nestlings have a wider frequency spectrum before the nestlings'' eyes have opened, a trait that increases their locatability. A strategy of having locatable calls could spread if favoured by mechanisms that overcome the increased predation risk associated with such calls. Two mechanisms are proposed: increased attenuation of the signals by emphasizing higher frequencies (a feature commonly found in begging calls) and  dispersion of energy over a wide time-frequency range, a trait that, because of sound degradation, probably masks the estimate of source distance by predators. This hypothesis agrees with predictions of models of intra-blood conflict: when predation costs are higher, level of solicitation (locatability) should decrease. Hole-nesting species, which have a lower risk of predation, have calls with wider frequency ranges and lower (less attenuable) medium frequencies than those of open-nesting  species of a similar weight.

TI FOUNDER EFFECT AND CULTURAL-EVOLUTION OF SONGS IN AN ISOLATED POPULATION
   OF CHAFFINCHES, FRINGILLA-COELEBS, IN THE CHATHAM ISLANDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB English chaffinches introduced by humans to New Zealand last century have subsequently colonized the Chatham Islands about 800 km to the east. Cultural evolution in songs of the Chatham Island population was investigated by comparing a sample of 30 song types with six equivalent samples from sites in New Zealand. Statistical analysis of 13 variables recorded on each song type showed that the basic structure of song has not changed significantly since chaffinches colonized the Chathams around  1900. Unlike the New Zealand birds, the Chatham birds have not developed elaborate end phrases to their songs. Comparisons within and among syllable pools at each site suggest that the processes of cultural transmission and cultural mutation have been unaffected by colonization history. The major finding of the study is that the syllable pool in the isolated Chatham population is depauperate relative to those in the New Zealand population. The Chatham Island songs, however, have not diverged greatly because 18 of the 20 Chatham syllable types are also present in New Zealand. It is concluded that the Chatham Islands were colonized by a small number of founders who had already learnt their syllables and songs from adult conspecifics in New Zealand. This appears to be the first evidence of the effect of a bottleneck of small population sizes in reducing the diversity of the syllable pool in an isolated population.

TI REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR OF FEMALE WHITE-CROWNED SPARROWS - EFFECT OF
   DIALECTS AND SYNTHETIC HYBRID SONGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous laboratory studies showed that female white-crowned sparrows, Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli performed more copulation solicitation displays when stimulated with male songs characteristic of their own local area than when stimulated by songs from other geographical locations. This female bioassay of male song was used in the present study to identify the relative contributions of different song components to the discrimination made by female subjects. In experiment 1, females responded with more solicitation displays when stimulated by a song dialect that was characteristic of their natal experience or of their breeding experience than when stimulated by a song dialect that was characteristic of a neighbouring population. In experiments 2 and 3,, ''hybrid'' songs were created which were synthesized from the two stimuli used in experiment 1. The females responded differentially to several of the hybrid songs. Replacing syllables of the ''local'' dialect control song with those of a neighbouring population which sang a different dialect indicated two general kinds of results: (1) it was necessary to replace about half of the local song with alien song components to obtain a significant reduction in female display; (2) some regions of the song were more important than others in controlling female sexual response. The results have implications for the functional descriptions of song ''dialects'' and for the more general proposition that different kinds of information are encoded in different parts of the songs of songbirds.

TI POINTING AS AN ACT OF SOCIAL COMMUNICATION BY MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Four rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta, were trained on average in 428 trials to indicate by pointing with the extended arm which of two food boxes contained a food reward. They then rapidly learn to select the box indicated (by pointing) by a human experimenter, making only 11-17 errors in 100 trials; whereas animals previously not trained to point performed at chance. It is concluded that rhesus monkeys, like chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, can be trained to point, whereas pigmy chimpanzees, Pan paniscus, may point naturally in the way a human child does.

TI THE GUARD HONEY-BEE - ONTOGENY AND BEHAVIORAL VARIABILITY OF WORKERS
   PERFORMING A SPECIALIZED TASK
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Guarding is a relatively unstudied aspect of honey bee, Apis mellifera L., worker behaviour. The aim of this study was to characterize quantitatively the ontogeny and individual variability of guarding behaviour, the allocation of workers to the guard population in a colony, and the intercolonial variability of guarding behaviour. Guarding is a discrete task performed by a distinct group of workers that are younger than foragers and older than house bees. Workers that guarded initiated the behaviour between the ages of 7 and 22 days. The mean age of the onset of guarding varied; the minimum mean age of guards for a colony was 13.6 days and the maximum was 16.0 days. Workers varied in the length of time they spent as a guard. Most bees guarded for less than 1 day; however, some guarded up to 6 consecutive days. The more time a bee spent guarding during a day the more likely that the bee was to guard for more than 1 day. Bees that guarded for more than 1 day also had longer and more frequent individual guarding bouts. All colonies that were studied had guard populations, but not all workers guarded. A relatively small proportion of any age cohort was observed to guard. The percentage of an age cohort that guarded varied among colonies, as did the size of the guard population. Guarding is a specialized task in that few bees guard, but guarding does not appear to require experience because so few bees remained as guards for very long. There was intercolonial variation  in all aspects of the ontogeny of guarding and in allocation of workers to guarding. This variation is discussed in the light of other studies of variation in worker behaviour.

TI THE SOCIAL-CONSEQUENCES OF HONEY-BEE POLYANDRY - THE EFFECTS OF KINSHIP
   ON WORKER INTERACTIONS WITHIN COLONIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Honey bees, Apis mellifera L., are polyandrous and several males simultaneously father offspring within a single colony. The relatedness of female colony members therefore varies with their paternity; workers encounter both patrilineal full sister (.ovrhdot.r = 0.75) and non-patrilineal half-sister (.hivin.r = 0.25) nestmates. The impact of this intra-colony genetic variation on social grooming and trophallaxis (liquid food exchange) among workers in colonies consisting of two  phenotypically-distinct worker patrilines was examined. Workers in these colonies groomed and fed a disproportionately large number of full sisters despite a tendency to encounter a disporportionately large number of half-sisters. Thus, workers actively discriminated between full and half-sisters. This patrilineal discrimination occurred both in colonies with laying queens and in a queenless colony rearing replacement queens. These results suggest that intracolony genetic variation may have a major effect on colony social organization.

TI RISK IN MOBBING FOR SOLITARY AND COLONIAL SWALLOWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) often nest solitarily and are ecologically similar to colonially nesting cliff swallows (H. pyrrhonota). Northern rough-winged swallows (Stelgidopteryx serripennis) also nest solitarily and are ecologically similar to colonially nesting bank swallows (Riparia riparia). We investigated risk-taking in the mobbing of predators for these four species of North American swallows. We presented model owl and weasel predators and examined tendencies of individuals  to dive at these predators during mobbing. Individuals of the two solitary species were significantly more likely to dive at predators than were individuals of the two colonial species. Since diving may be risky, we suggest that solitary species take greater per capita risks in mobbing than do colonial species. The reduced risk of falling victim during mobbing may be a benefit of group living that is perhaps independent of the effectiveness of mobbing.

TI THE DYNAMICS OF THE DAILY ROUND OF THE HARVESTER ANT COLONY
   (POGONOMYRMEX-BARBATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Colonies of the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, do various tasks outside the nest. There is a daily temporal pattern in the numbers of ants engaged in each of five activities: foraging, nest maintenance, patrolling, midden work and convening. Perturbations were carried out in the field to investigate how the daily round changes in response to environmental events and colony needs. Interfering with nest maintenance, foraging or both caused changes in the temporal patterns in all five of the observed activities. Removing nest maintenance workers, foragers or both caused the numbers involved in all five activities to decrease, and there were temporal patterns in the effects of removals. The results of both interference and removal experiments show that the extent to which a worker group does one activity affects the behaviour of other groups. When nest maintenance or foraging is impeded experimentally, these two activities are of reciprocal priority. When both are impeded,  foraging is of higher priority than nest maintenance.

TI DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN FULL-SIBLING SPINY MICE (ACOMYS-CAHIRINUS) BY
   OLFACTORY SIGNATURES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Discrimination between individual full siblings was tested in spiny mice (Acomys cahirinus). At weaning, intact litters were separated into two pairs so that animals only had social contact with one of their full siblings. Following 10 days of being housed in pairs, the four weanling from a given litter were reunited in an observation terrarium. Pairings by familiar siblings were more frequent than unfamiliar-sibling pairings, indicating that interactions among close kin are mediated by the recognition of individual signatures rather than general phenotypic traits shared by all members of a kin class. Animals rendered anosmic by intranasal injections of zinc sulphate displayed no evidence of discriminating between familiar and unfamiliar siblings. Olfactory cues therefore appear to function as the signatures by which individual siblings are recognized. Since all aniamls were fed identical diets and otherwise maintained in similar environments, the differences in olfactory  signatures between full siblings are most likely a function of genetic variability within this class of kin.

TI SEARCHING FOR CRYPTIC PREY - EVIDENCE FOR OPTIMAL SEARCH RATES AND THE
   FORMATION OF SEARCH IMAGES IN QUAIL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It has previously been proposed that the success of a predator foraging for cryptic prey can be enhanced in two different ways: by the adoption of an optimal search rate and by the formation of a search image. The optimal search rate reflects a trade-off between the rate at which prey are encountered (which increases with search rate) and the probability of detecting an encountered prey item (which decreases with search rate). The formation of a search image increases a predator''s ability to  detect cryptic prey. To test these hypotheses three series of experiments were performed in which bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) searched for artificial prey in a large aviary. The colour of the prey was varied to achieve different degrees of camouflage. The results provide qualitative support for the hypothesis that the birds adjust their search speed to maximize the rate of prey capture. The use of search images is suggested by the observation that the probability of detection tends  to increase with successive captures, and to decrease between captures.

TI SALAMANDER TERRITORIALITY - PHEROMONAL MARKERS AS ADVERTISEMENT BY MALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A laboratory experiment was performed to test the hypothesis that male red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) use pheromones contained in faecal pellets to identify male-marked territories. Each of 25 males was tested randomly under four conditions: (1) a burrow marked with its own faecal pellet versus one marked with a conspecific''s pellet; (2) own-marked versus surrogate-marked burrows (the surrogate being a pellet of wadded paper); (3) conspecific-marked versus surrogate-marked  burrows; and (4) a control of two surrogate-marked burrows. Males spent significantly more time in own-marked than in conspecific-marked burrows and significantly more time in surrogate-marked than in conspecific-marked burrows. Males favoured own-marked over surrogate-marked burrows. No position bias was found in the control. Males spent significantly more time nose-tapping (olfactory sampling) to a conspecific''s pellet when it was paired with a surrogate but showed no differences in the other  three tests. Significantly more time was spent in a submissive posture in front of the conspecific-marked burrow than in front of either their own-marked or the surrogate-marked burrows; no difference was found between own-marked versus surrogate-marked burrows or in the control. Time spent in the threat posture did not differ significantly between burrows in any condition. These data permit the inferences that males of P. cinereus use faecal pellets to mark and identify territories, avoid or  display submissively toward burrows marked by conspecific males, and prefer own-marked shelters.

TI A NOVEL AUTOSTIMULATORY PHEROMONE REGULATING TRANSPORT OF LEAVES IN
   ATTA-CEPHALOTES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Workers of the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes mark freshly cut and stored leaves with an abdominal secretion, prior to transport. Such leaves are more readily picked up than unmarked leaves. This effect, and subsequent marking, can be experimentally induced by an extract of Dufour''s gland, which contains a number of straight-chain alkanes and an alkene. The components active in releasing pick-up and marking when applied to filter-paper discs are n-tridecane and (Z)-9-nonadecene, and the  latter also affects transport behaviour. These compounds appear to have a role in regulating the chain transport of leaves from the cutting site to the nest; the secretion alters the transport behaviour of the ant that applies it, and this pheromone is therefore partly autostimulatory.

TI MATING PATTERNS, SOCIETIES AND THE ECOGEOGRAPHY OF MACAQUES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Review
AB A 29-month field study of the pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina), and a review of the literature on its genus, suggests that, in this cercopithecine group, resource distribution may influence male grouping tendency not by way of female distribution, but rather indirectly through female sexual behaviour. This variation on a usual mammalian theme is achieved by female control of sexual interaction, which allows females to establish either of 2 social conditions. These have different implications for male behaviour, affecting the quality of inter-male relations and male copulatory behaviour. Ecological correlates of the 2 social conditions are discussed.

TI ON FIGHTING IN MICE - IS THERE A SENSITIVE PERIOD FOR ISOLATION EFFECTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To investigate the differential age-duration effects of isolation in promoting attacks and fighting in male laboratory mice (Mus musculus), a factorial study of 5 different isolation intervals (0,40,41,42,43 days) initiated at 5 different ages (21, 28, 35, 56, 84 days since birth) was completed. Five hundred ICR mice (250 experimental isolates; 250 control partners) were studied in a procedure that yielded detailed information on the interactional processes that led up to attacks and  fighting. Measures of non-social reactivity and weight were taken for all animals. The results support the proposition that the effect of isolation is a joint function of the developmental status of the animal at the time of isolation, the duration of isolation, and the developmental status of the partner. Beyond the notion of a sensitive period, the effects of isolation are superimposed upon species-typical developmental changes in both the subject and the partner.

TI THE ROLE OF FREQUENCY-MODULATION IN CONTROLLING THE RESPONSE OF MALLARD
   DUCKLINGS (ANAS-PLATYRHYNCHOS) TO CONSPECIFIC DISTRESS CALLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three experiments examined the response of mallard ducklings to conspecific distress calls. In experiment 1, a synthetic call was constructed from a single distress note, buy recording it on a digital disc and then using a software routine to regularly repeat this stored note with the average period (267 ms) of the original call. Ducklings were then tested for their tendency to inhibit their own distress vocalizations in response to either this synthetic call, the original call, or a constant-frequency tone mimic. They showed a significantly stronger inhibitory response to the synthetic call than to the tone mimic, but an even stronger response to the original call. The former result indicated that the synthetic call was an effective stimulus, and suggested that some aspect of the frequency modulation found in distress notes is required to evoke the normal duckling inhibitory response. The latter result further suggested that the acoustic variability found in the original call, but not the synthetic call, may be of importance for controlling duckling behavior. Experiment 2 demonstrated that several other minor differences between the synthetic call and original call (number of notes per call and the digital recording of the synthetic call) could not account for the difference in duckling response to these 2 calls. Finally, in experiment 3, two additional synthetic stimuli were constructed from the digitized note, by first excising either the initial (front-chop) or terminal (rear-chop) frequency modulation found in each distress note, then creating amplitude envelopes for these new notes similar to that of the unaltered note, and finally repeating these notes to form calls with the same note period as the original call. The ducklings tested with the synthetic normal-note call and synthetic front-chop call showed a significantly stronger inhibitory response than the ducklings tested with the synthetic rear-chop call and the tone mimic. The terminal descending frequency sweep is apparently an important feature of distress notes for triggering the response of ducklings to conspecific distress calls.

TI AUDITORY ACUITY IN THE ORIENTATION BEHAVIOR OF THE BUSHCRICKET
   PACHYSAGELLA-AUSTRALIS WALKER (ORTHOPTERA, TETTIGONIIDAE, SAGINAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The female tettigoniid P. australis (Saginae) orients to the call of the conspecific with an angular acuity of .+-. 5.degree.. This acuity is mediated by sound entering the tympanic receptors through the auditory trachea and the slits exterior to the tympanic membranes. The phonokinetic response of females was filmed in an arena. The slit system was blocked on both anterior and posterior ports with the effect that the female spiralled towards the sound source; blocking the posterior slit alone reduced the auditory acuity as did the partial occlusion of the fore slit, but in both cases the female located the male. Complete blocking of the auditory spiracle caused the insect to spiral towards the unoperated side: reducing the sound input to one side by some 8-12 dB, by plugging the auditory bulla with compacted cotton wool, did not substantially affect the orientation pattern of the insect. Ablation of the tympanic organ on 1 side caused the female to move in a circular pattern to the unoperated side. A hypothesis is formulated whereby the female, when actively orienting to the calling male, may use the slit port system to gain a high degree of auditory acuity to sound in front of her body axis. When off target she may use the less accurate spiracular input system. This system, with its greater sensitivity to high frequency sounds, may function as an effective anti-predator warning system.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB Observations of breeding activities of male and female crayfish (O. rusticus) in a natural stream population during the explosive spring breeding period, and supplemental laboratory observations, indicate a promiscuous mating system characterized by intense intermale aggression. Males wandered extensively over the substrate, fought frequently with each other and attempted to disrupt copulating pairs. Larger males (as distinguished by large chela size) more frequently initiated and won aggressive encounters and interrupted copulating pairs more successfully than smaller males, but were subjected to greater predation. Intense intermale aggression ceased when females sequestered themselves under rocks in the stream or were removed from the laboratory population. Brief resistance by females to approaching males, along with sequestering behavior, suggests that female choice may also occur.

TI EVOLUTIONARY AND NEUROBIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF SELECTIVE PHONOTAXIS IN
   THE SPRING PEEPER (HYLA-CRUCIFER)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of the spring peeper (H. crucifer) in central Missouri [USA] produce frequency-modulated, sinusoidal advertisement calls with a duration of 90-250 ms, and a mid-point frequency of 2800-3360 Hz. The frequency of the call is inversely correlated with body size. In playback experiments with synthetic stimuli, females did not prefer a frequency-modulated call to a call of constant frequency. Females preferred a call with a duration of 150 ms to sounds with durations of 40, 75 and 400 ms; a call of 300 ms was just as attractive as the 150-ms call. Females preferred a call of 2875 Hz to alternatives of 4000 Hz and 2600 Hz. The auditory system of H. crucifer is thus only roughly tuned to the temporal and spectral properties of the advertisement call. The female''s specificity with respect to duration alone is adequate for species recognition, but intraspecific mate choice based on call frequency is extremely unlikely.

TI COLONIAL BREEDING REDUCES NEST PREDATION IN THE COMMON GULL
   (LARUS-CANUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It is often suggested that colonial breeding reduces nest predation for birds with a high defense capacity, but experimental comparison of predation at solitary and colonial nests is seldom feasible within a single species. Such a test in the commonn gull (L. canus) is discussed. The rate of predation on experimental eggs was significantly lower near colonies than near solitary gull nests and the eggs survived longer at the edge of a colony than farther away. Communal mobbing of nest predators is the likely reason. In both of 2 yr, almost all nests of solitary gulls were destroyed by predators; most clutches survived in colonies. Nest predation strongly selects for colonial breeding in the present population of common gulls.

TI LOCOMOTOR CAPACITY AND FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF KALAHARI LACERTID LIZARDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Closely related lacertid lizards (Eremias, Nucras) in the Kalahari desert differ in patterns of foraging behavior. Some species are relatively sedentary (sit-and-wait); others are more active (widely-foraging) predators. Whether whole-animal locomotor capacities (cruising endurance on a treadmill, initial speed and maximum burst speed in a racetrack, and sprint endurance in a torus-shaped track) correlated with interspecific differences in foraging behavior was determined. Two of 3 widely-foraging species had greater cruising endurance, greater sprint endurance, but lower burst speed than did a sit-and-wait species. The 2 spp. that sprinted quickly also had limited endurance, and vice versa. Pre-feeding negatively influenced endurance but not sprint capacity. Theoretical models of foraging behavior should recognize that ectotherms have limited endurance, that there can be a trade-off between speed and endurance, and that pre-feeding can reduce some aspects of locomotor capacity.

TI THE CAREGIVING CARE-SEEKING BALANCE IN CAPTIVE COMMON MARMOSETS
   (CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A hypothesis to explain differences in infant social development in species with multiple caregivers is described. The hypothesis states that the distribution of an infant''s time and activities among the individuals in its group is determined by the balance between the relative amounts of care-seeking by the infant and caregiving by the other members of the group. This generates several predictions that are investigated by experimentally reducing the care available to a group of infant common marmosets (C. jacchus) and comparing their interactions with caregivers with those of a control group of infants that experienced normal levels of care. The results bear out several of the predictions: infants receiving less care than usual spend less time in non-care-seeking activities and there are some increases in care-seeking behavior; infants continue to seek differentially from different caregivers, and no compensation among caregivers in their behavior towards infants is found.

TI SHORT-TERM LEARNING AND THE SEARCHING ACCURACY OF EGG-LAYING BUTTERFLIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Searching constraints influence foraging patterns in 3 spp. of Colias butterflies [C. philodice eriphyle, C. alexandra, C. meadii]. The activity of egg-laying females is partitioned into periods of seaching for oviposition plants and periods of visiting flowers for nectar. Eggs are laid most frequently upon legume host-plants, although females frequently land upon non-legume species, particularly those bearing a superficial resemblance to suitable hosts. The average frequency of these  landing errors decreases over the course of an egg-laying flight, implying that females learn to identify host-plants more accurately on the basis of recent experience. Landing accuracy is low after periods of nectar-feeding, which suggests a trade-off between the 2 searching modalities. Within oviposition sequences, females that visit a narrow range of host species make fewer landing errors than females visiting a broader host-plant set. Two interpretations of these data are presented: that  partitioning searching time into discrete modes may enhance overall searching efficiency; and that experience and searching specialization may increase searching accuracy in invertebrates, as demonstrated previously for vertebrates. Searching dynamics of this type may explain some discrepancies between the predictions made by simple optimal diet models and the occurrence of switching behaviors in foragers.

TI THE ADVANTAGES OF SOCIAL FORAGING IN DOWNY WOODPECKERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The advantages gained by downy woodpeckers (P. pubescens) which join mixed-species winter flocks were investigated. Woodpeckers foraging alone showed high levels of vigilance as measured by head-cocking rates, and low feeding rates. Woodpeckers foraging with 1 or 2 flock members showed intermediate rates of head-cocking and feeding, while woodpeckers foraging with flocks of 3 or more birds showed low head-cocking rates and high feeding rates. Although local enhancement and copying may contribute to the woodpeckers'' increased foraging efficiency in a flock, these do not appear to be the main factors. As downy woodpeckers spend less time on vigilance, they devote more time to foraging, thereby increasing their foraging efficiency.

TI CONTEXT-CORRELATED PARAMETERS OF SNAKE AND LIZARD TONGUE-FLICKING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Three parameters of tongue-flicking in snakes and lizards (oscillation duration, oscillation number and relative circumscribed area) were examined in filmed captive contexts. A comparative survey of 4 lizard [Tiliqua scincoides, Gerrhonotus liocephalus, G. kingi, Abronia deppi], and 10 snake species [Tropidophus greenwayi, Boa constrictor, Boaedon fuliginosus, Boiga dendrophila, Chrysopelea ornata, Elaphe guttata, E. obsoleta, Gonyosoma oxycephalum, Ophedrys aestivus, Spilotes pullatus] uncovered a consistent trend for exploratory tongue flicks to have both shorter oscillation durations and smaller relative circumscribed areas than defensive tongue flicks. Young sibling garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) studied in 4 contexts (feeding, exploration, social, defense) replicated the above results and clearly distinguished the other 2 contexts as well. Fine-grained studies of tongue movement topography have methodological and evolutionary implications for the study of squamate reptile behavior.

TI A FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATION OF TOP-BOTTOM ASYMMETRY IN VERTICAL ORBWEBS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The hypothesis that orb-weaving spiders (Nuctenea scloptaria) improve their ability to catch entangled prey by locating the hub of their web (the location where they often sit and wait for prey to strike the web) somewhat above the web''s center was tested. In both field and laboratory tests spiders reached a vibration source below them faster than they reached the same source located an equal distance above them. The difference was apparently due to the greater amount of time required to run in the upward direction, since the time taken to react to the stimulus was the same for both stimulus locations. If the spider''s aim is to build a web in which the average time to reach prey is minimized, it should locate the hub such that the distances from hub to top and bottom of the web are directly proportional to the running speeds in the 2 directions. This is what was found.

TI BEHAVIORAL MECHANISMS IN TERRITORY AND GROUP MAINTENANCE OF THE BROWN
   HYENA, HYAENA-BRUNNEA, IN THE SOUTHERN KALAHARI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Most brown hyaenas (Hyaena burnnea) in the southern Kalahari live in small social groups which inhabit large territories, but the members of a group forage solitarily. The remainder of the population comprise dispersing subadults and nomadic adult males. Aggression is not marked between animals of the same sex from neighboring territories and in its extreme takes the form of neck-biting. Interactions between group living hyaenas and nomads are less aggressive. Little evidence for a dominance hierarchy among group members was obtained and little aggression between group members was observed. Group cohesion is maintained through the greeting ceremony, allogrooming and possibly some forms of muzzle-wrestling. Muzzle-wresting also seems to be particularly implicated in subadult recruitment and expulsion which are important in regulating group size.

TI FEMALE MATE CHOICE IN THE CICHLID FISH CICHLASOMA-NIGROFASCIATUM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male body size (standard length) and prior reproductive experience were tested for their influence on the mate choice of naive female convict cichlid fish, C. nigrofasciatum. Females showed no preference based on male reproductive experience, but significantly preferred the larger of 2 males. The possibility that the size dimorphism is a sexually-selected trait in male C. nigrofasciatum is discussed. Individual broods of C. nigrofasciatum were reared and sexually mature animals measured to determine the relationship between sex, age and size. Males of the same age showed sufficient size variation to serve as a basis for female choice. The size variation necessary for selection to operate exists in male C. nigrofasciatum. Male body size may be a sexually selected trait in this monogamous species.

TI A MODEL FOR THE EVOLUTION OF DESPOTIC VERSUS EGALITARIAN SOCIETIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An optimization model that defines some conditions under which group-living and cooperating individuals interact in a despotic vs. an egalitarian manner is presented. The model assumes that dominants within groups can bias resources or fitness in their favor to the limits established by the subordinates'' options outside the group. Ecological factors, such as the cost of dispersing and relative benefit of group living compared to solitary living, determine the the subordinates'' options and greatly affect the degree of bias the dominant can impose. The degree of relatedness among group members also had a large impact on the degree bias. To determine whether groups should be composed of relatives or non-relatives, a 2nd optimization analysis seeks the best biasing and disperal strategy from the point of view of a dominant individual. Specific sets of conditions favor the evolution of the following kinds of behavior within the societies: solitary living or non-cooperation,  egalitarian cooperation among relatives, despotic cooperation among relatives, egalitarian cooperation among non-relatives, and despotic cooperation among non-relatives. The model provides insights into the interactions between a basic behavioral process, i.e., dominance, and ecological contexts in the determining aspects of population structure such as group size, dispersal pattern, group composition and fitness bias within groups. Three examples of animal [bird, lion, mongoose] societies with different degrees of bias which closely fit the predictions of the model are listed.

TI DENSITY-DEPENDENT MORTALITY AND THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Existing models of kin selection implicitly assume that the intensity of density-dependent mortality depends on the size or density of the entire deme. If individuals compete for locally limited resources, then mortality may also depend on local population density. Conditions are derived for evolutionary equilibrium when the fitness of an individual depends on the phenotypes of a local group of conspecifics with which it interacts and the size of the local group. In general, altruistic behaviors which reduce the individual fitness of the actor but increase that of the recipient are favored towards individuals whose coefficient of relationship exceeds a threshold value. Harming behaviors which reduce the individual fitness of both the actor and the recipient are favored towards individuals below this threshold value. The magnitude of this threshold depends on the nature of the processes that cause density-dependent mortality and the average coefficient of relationship in the group.

TI BROOD SUCCESS IN VARIABLE ENVIRONMENTS - IMPLICATIONS FOR PARENTAL CARE
   ALLOCATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A model is developed which makes predictions about intraspecific variation in parental care patterns. The model assumes that animals can respond to predictable changes in conditions for rearing offspring, and can adjust the amount of parental care they provide. The following predictions are made: where the environment or the parent''s condition varies predictably, animals should provide more care to successive broods under improving conditions, and less care under deteriorating conditions; in stochastic environments, variation in brood success during the period of parental care should have a predictable effect on subsequent brood-care; and, in non-uniform environments or populations, parents facing higher than average mortality risks of types independent of parental effort should increase care provided for current offspring. Parents whose mortality risks result from parental effort should provide less care for their offspring. These predictions are assessed in relation to the available empirical evidence. Much of this suggests that parental care patterns vary within species and may often be adjusted by individuals according to prevailing and projected conditions. Data could not be found to test all aspects of the theory, so further field studies would be valuable.

TI THE FUNCTION OF COURTSHIP SONG RHYTHMS IN DROSOPHILA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The courtship songs of Drosophila are produced by male''s wing vibration and consist of a series of pulses, with an inter-pulse interval (IPI) of 34 ms for D. melanogaster and 48 ms for D. simulans. The IPI are not constant in length during courtship, but oscillate sinusoidally with 55-s cycles in the former species and 35-s cycles in the latter. D. melanogaster females were stimulated by artificially generated courtship songs and they mate fastest when the song incorporates a 55-s oscillation superimposed on a 34-ms IPI. D. simulans females, on the other hand, mate fastest with a 48-ms IPI and a 35-s oscillation period. Consequently these newly-discovered song cycles produce significant mating enhancement in these species, with the females showing a preference for songs which carry both the species-specific IPI and the species-specific IPI rhythm.

AB Free-flying males of the checkered white butterfly, P. protodice, were presented with tethered females that varied with respect to both size (as measured by forewing length) and age (as measured by wing wear). Because males make a substantial investment in their offspring through nutrients passed to the female during copulation, they were expected to court young and large females for longer times than older and smaller females, and they did so. Additional experiments suggest that size discriminations are made on the basis of apparent wing area and that age discriminations are made on the basis of an age-related increase in UV reflectance that occurs in females. The adaptive value of these discriminations is examined.

TI EFFECTS OF WATER CONDUCTIVITY ON ELECTRO-COMMUNICATION IN THE
   WEAK-ELECTRIC FISH BRIENOMYRUS-NIGER (MORMYRIFORMES)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A characteristic electric organ discharge display in social encounters between mormyrid fish is a temporary discharge cessation. Using this response, the useful range of electrocommunication under different water conductivity conditions was investigated in the mormyrid B. niger. An individual fish was confined to a porous ceramic shelter tube and moved from a starting distance of 380 cm toward a similarly confined conspecific until discharge cessation occurred. The moved fish was subsequently returned to its original position. Water conductivity affects the peak-to-peak source voltage of the electric organ and the sensitivity of the fish''s electroreceptors. Within a range of 10-36,000 .mu.S/cm, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the electric organ discharge declined as a power function. At 120 .mu.S/cm, the amplitude was 50%, and at 300 .mu.S/cm, 30% of the 10 .mu.S/cm value. The interfish distance at which discharge cessation occurred and the associated electric field gradients were dependent on water conductivity and upon the spatial orientation of the 2 fish (end-to-end or parallel orientations of their shelter tubes). The respective ranges were from 135 cm and 0.02 mV/cm at 52 .mu.S/cm (parallel orientation) to 22 cm and 0.36 mV/cm at 678 .mu.S/cm (end-to-end orientation). When the data for both tube orientations were combined, the relationship between water conductivity (x) and the distance at which discharge cessation occurred (y) could be expressed by a power function, y = K .cntdot. xa (with K = 102.97 and a = .sbd.0.56). When an electrically silent fish was moved away from its conspecific, a discharge resumption in the form of a high-frequency rebound occasionally effected changes in the other fish''s discharge activity at distances up to 157 cm (with an associated electric field gradient of 0.01 mV/cm under the lowest conductivity condition).

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Synthetic call notes were broadcast to male E. coqui treefrogs in their natural habitat. The frogs avoided acoustic overlap with relatively long duration tone stimuli by calling only within the short silent interval between tones. A temporal change in call pattern was observed in response to tone stimuli of various frequencies and intensities. This response is the basis for construction of a behavioral auditory threshold function for this species. This function does not show a sensitivity maximum at frequencies corresponding to those in the advertisement call; it demonstrates that the frogs are capable of behaviorally responding to sounds over a frequency range which is greater than that required for detection of the species-specific vocalizations, and is sufficient for detection of at least 1 sympatric anuran species.

TI CENTRAL PLACE FORAGING IN RATTUS-NORVEGICUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rats could accumulate food pellets by responding on 1 lever, and then gain access to them by responding on a 2nd lever N times (experiment 1), by ceasing to respond on the 1st lever for D seconds (experiment 2), or by making a single, vigorous response to force W on the 2nd lever (experiment 3). The design may be viewed as an analog of central place foraging. As N (distance), D (time), or W (effort) increased, load (the average number of pellets accumulated before they were eaten) also increased. Apparently delay mediated the effect of the other independent variables. A simple model of central place foraging accommodated the data.

TI DIVISION OF LABOR AND SPECIFICATION OF CASTES IN THE RED IMPORTED FIRE
   ANT SOLENOPSIS-INVICTA BUREN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Division of labor in S. invicta follows a familiar pattern: younger, smaller ants tend toward brood care while older, larger ants tend toward foraging. Long-term observations of marked individuals reveal that length of nursing and foraging careers and the age of transition between these activities vary between and within size groups, and are related to length of life. Experiments with entire colonies show that larger ants are more likely than smaller ants to forage for insect prey. There are 2 main worker castes, nurses and foragers, whose members span a wide age-size range, and a large reserve subcaste, heterogeneous in age, size and behavior: reserves may nurse, forage, store liquid food or relay food from nurses to foragers. The proportion of ants engaged in foraging decreases with colony size because many ants in large colonies are not exposed to recruitment signals.

TI CHANGES IN THE BEHAVIOR OF A CARABID BEETLE (PTEROSTICHUS-MELANARIUS)
   FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO FOOD AND WATER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Six experiments elucidate behavioral consequences of feeding and drinking in a predaceous ground beetle (P. melanarius). A sensitizing effect follows feeding but not drinking. This effect, which facilitates the subsequent location of food in an open field, cannot be accounted for in terms of increased locomotion. The enhanced ability to locate food following feeding lasts no more than .apprx. 10 min. The sensitizing effect is not specific to the kind of food consumed, but the consummatory response of eating is necessary. The effect seems to enhance the ability to locate water.

TI DIFFERENTIAL REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND FACULTATIVE ADJUSTMENT OF
   SEX-RATIOS AMONG CAPTIVE FEMALE BONNET MACAQUES (MACACA-RADIATA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a group of captive bonnet macaques (M. radiata) housed at the California [USA] Primate Research Center, variance in reproductive success among females is primarily due to differences in infant survival. The infants of low-ranking females have a smaller probability of surviving to 6 mo. of age than do the infants of other females. In addition, the juvenile daughters of low-ranking females are more vulnerable to behaviorally induced mortality than are other immature animals. Observational evidence indicates that this mortality is the direct result of aggression by unrelated, higher-ranking adult females. Although infants'' sex is not consistently related to survival, yearly fluctuations in the survival of male and female infants are reflected in the extent and direction of the skew in the sex ratio of offspring produced the following year. Years in which the highest proportion of male infants survive are followed by years in which the largest proportions of the birth cohorts are composed of males, and years in which the largest proportions of females survive are followed by years in which the largest proportions of birth cohorts are composed of females. For infant females the probability of surviving is reduced when a substantial proproportion of the birth cohort is composed of females. The same pattern is evident among the sons of low-ranking females. The adaptive significance of behaviorally induced variation in reproductive success among females is considered in relation to these data.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB From Nov. 1977-March 1978 the scent-marking behavior of free-ranging coyotes in southern Quebec [Canada] was recorded. Fourteen animals were marked by foot-pad ablation, which made it possible to recognize individuals'' tracks in the snow and to relate scent-marking with social organization. A total of 949 scent-marks were observed. The identity of the animals was known for 50% of the tracking distances. Animals living in territorial groups (pairs and pairs with juveniles) marked more than twice as much as solitary non-territorial individuals. The former used stronger forms of marking significantly more often than the latter.

TI DO DIGGER WASPS COMMIT THE CONCORDE FALLACY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The Concorde fallacy is a theoretical error which tempts economists and evolutionists. It amounts to investing further in a project simply because one has invested in it heavily in the past, rather than because of potential future return on investment. Digger wasps, S. ichneumoneus, disconcertingly appear to behave as if following the Concorde fallacy. Pairs of females fight over jointly occupied nests, provisioned with paralyzed katydids. The prior investment by each wasp in the nest is measured as the number of katydids that she has put into it. The true value of the nest is approximated by the total number of katydids there. The wasp with the least prior investment may be the one most likely to surrender. In a post-hoc attempt at rationalizing this Concordian result, some pitfalls of naive optimality speculations are examined and analysis in terms of evolutionary stable strategies is recommended.

TI ANALYSIS OF HUNGER FROM FEEDING RATE OBSERVATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The satiation of a feeding animal can be treated as a state variable and studied along the lines of black box analysis. This yields a method of checking whether a single state variable suffices to describe the animal''s internal state: an operational definition of satiation (or its complement, hunger); and predictions of the feeding rate in various feeding regimes. An analysis is given for an idealized animal; food supply is constant. No further assumptions are required regarding the physiological or anatomical interpretation of satiation, and only minimal, qualitative assumptions regarding its autonomous rate of change (digestion rate). Replacing satiation by a transformed state variable produces an alternative system description that may have advantages in some applications.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Territorial male great tits (P. major L.) usually forage on the ground, sing from perches with a mean height of 9.3 m, and perform most other activities between 2 and 4 m. Analyses of their habitat''s visual and acoustical stratification indicate that great tits sing from high perches to make themselves hard to locate visually rather than to make their songs carry farther. The birds'' selection of inconspicuous singing spots is further substantiated by their striking preference for hawthorn [Crataegus spp.] trees, which have an extremely dense crown and produce leaves very early in the year.

DT Article
AB Social factors influencing reproductive activity in laboratory groups of gerbils were investigated using the ventral scent-gland as an index of reproductive condition. Sexual maturation and breeding were suppressed in female offspring remaining with their parents. In family groups living in enclosures, daughters rarely bred in the presence of their mother but breeding activity increased after her death. Intra-female aggression resulted in the re-establishment of a single breeding female in groups where more than 1 started to breed. In a controlled social situation in which females were caged with their mothers, sexual maturation was suppressed in the presence of their mother and the continuing presence of her 2nd litter, but not in the presence of a non-pregnant mother or a mother whose 2nd litter was removed.

AB Cockerels (40) were exposed to an artificial training model for 15 days. These sessions were between 1 and 15 days (I groups); 16 and 30 days (II groups); or 31 and 45 days (III groups) after hatching. Otherwise the subjects were reared either in isolation (groups Ii, IIi, IIIi) or in pairs with a pullet (groups I.female., II.female., III.female.). Sexual tests giving a choice between the training model and a novel model or a conspecific were performed at maturity (5 mo.). Following responses during training suggested that all birds except group IIIi had established a strong filial attachment bond with their model. Results of tests on adults showed that the birds in group IIIi, with weak filial attachments to the training model, were strongly sexually imprinted with the training model. The birds in groups Ii and IIi, with strong filial attachment to the training model, did not generally attempt to mate with the training model. All socially reared birds mated preferentially with the conspecific choice object but they also mated with the training model towards which they were all previously filially attached. The development of a sexual preference may not be a direct consequence of the filial attachment.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The aggressive behavior of red-brown and green Actinia individuals during intra- and inter-color morph encounters staged in the laboratory is described. By considering the colors and relative sizes of the opponents, the outcomes of contests are predictable to the observer. Red-brown anemones were highly aggressive. Larger individuals attacked before smaller components and subsequently won encounters. A variable threshold for aggression appears to underlie this difference; an attempt to correlate threshold with absolute size was only partially successful. Using the results of many encounters, it is possible to establish a branching and overlapping dominance hierarchy among red-brown anemones. Green individuals were less aggressive and predominantly lost contests with red-brown anemones.

Aggression was higher on the inner beach than on the mudflat or outer beach. For all species on the inner beach, and for black-bellied plovers Pluvialis squatarola on the mudflat, aggression increased as density increased; whereas for sanderlings Calidris alba on the outer beach, aggression decreased as numbers increased. Interspecific aggression occurred only on the inner beach. Although the total amount of aggression did not correlate with body size, several parameters of aggression did (interspecific aggression index, percentage of encounters that were interspecific, and percentage of interspecific encounters won). These factors are discussed in terms of competition.

TI OPTIMAL FORAGING OF STICKLEBACKS ON SWARMING PREY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Hungry sticklebacks, G. aculeatus, preferentially attacked the densest region of a swarm of water fleas [Daphnia magna], but with decreasing attack readiness they increasingly preferred less dense regions. Such a hunger dependent change in feeding preference has not yet been dealt with by optimal foraging theory. A model, which assumes that high swarm densities provide high feeding rates (because of small inter-prey distances) but also high costs of confusion, predicts that a predator should always choose the lowest prey density in which it can achieve a feeding rate sufficient to satisfy its hunger. Some predictions of the model were experimentally verified. Hungry fish have a higher feeding rate in a high prey density than in a lower density and less hungry fish have a higher rate in a low density than in a high density.

The number of ants recruited to a food source depends on the food quality and on the duration of starvation of the colony, and is related to the concentration of trail pheromone on the trail but not to the number of ants initially returning to the nest from the food source. There is a relationship between the concentration of pheromone on the trail and the attractiveness of the food. A component of the trail pheromone, methyl 4-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylate, elicited similar recruitment behavior to a natural trail. Individual workers of A. cephalotes appear to modulate the number of ants recruited for food retrieval by varying the quantity of pheromone secreted from the poison sac during trail-laying.

TI REPRODUCTIVE SYNCHRONY, PARENTAL INVESTMENT, AND THE EVOLUTIONARY
   DYNAMICS OF SEXUAL SELECTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Computer simulations showed that reproductive synchrony in the greater investing sex can evolve as a strategy for increasing the investment of mates. The potential for synchrony to increase in frequency for this reason decreased with increasing population size, decreasing importance of synchrony-enforced investment, increasing variance in quality among members of the lesser investing sex, and decreasing male:female sex ratio. By reducing the payoffs to desertion, synchrony may result in the evolution of uniquely effective forms of parental care by the lesser investing sex, making desertion unprofitable regardless of the availability of potential mates. Relative levels of optimal parental investment are subject to change through the action of sexual selection itself.

TI OPTIMAL FORAGING IN BUMBLEBEES - RULE OF MOVEMENT BETWEEN FLOWERS WITHIN
   INFLORESCENCES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Nectar-collecting bumblebees will probably forage in ways that maximize their net rate of energy intake. Attention is focused on the manner in which the bumblebees move from one flower to another within inflorescences. Observations were made on workers of B. appositus, which were collecting nectar from Aconitum columbianum (monkshood). The rule of movement of the bumblebees was determined and compared, in terms of net rate of energy intake, with several possible alternative rules. Two of these alternatives gave equally high net rates of energy intake. The observed rule was very similar in nature to one of these and indistinguishable from both in terms of net rate of energy intake.

DT Article
AB A free-ranging troop of 108-130 yellow baboons (P. cynocephalus) was sampled systematically for 1596 h. Seasonal variations in the area of the range of the troop and the degree to which the patterns of range use of the troop were clumped in space are correlated with diversity of use of sleeping sites, time of departure from sleeping trees, number of impregnable females in the troop and number of emigrations from and immigrations into the troop by adult males. The reproductive strategies of troop members, especially those of impregnable females, are suggested to influence patterns of range use. Some effects of the presence of observers on the troop are measured and discussed.

TI PATERNITY ASSURANCE AND ALTERED ROLES IN THE MATING-BEHAVIOR OF A GIANT
   WATER BUG, ABEDUS-HERBERTI (HETEROPTERA, BELOSTOMATIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Natural selection theory predicts that male brooding giant water bugs, A. herberti Hidalgo, should possess paternity assurance mechanisms and have altered roles in courtship. Mating behavior of this species was studied to check these predictions. Females were aggressive in courtship, but male display was an essential element. Copulation always preceded oviposition, and copulation and oviposition were cyclical events under male control. Females engaged in cyclical polyandry in the laboratory, and this threat under natural conditions presumably favored the male-dominated system of alternating bouts of copulation and oviposition. Male and gravid female bugs seemed equally eager to exchange brooding services for eggs under laboratory conditions. Courtship roles are discussed in relation to relative parental investment and availability of eligible males.

TI BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATIONS TO HIGH-DENSITY NESTING IN COMMON GUILLEMOT
   URIA-AALGE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Common guillemots characteristically nest in dense groups in close bodily contact. Behavioral adaptations to high density nesting were examined by comparing the guillemot with the closely related razorbill [Alca torda], which nests at lower densities, and by comparing the behavior of guillemots nesting at different densities. Guillemots perform active and passive appeasement displays more frequently at higher densities and more frequently than razorbills. Guillemots return to the colony 4 mo. earlier than razorbills and perform site-ownership displays more frequently. Extra-marital mounting is common among guillemots but not among razorbills. Guillemots are able to recognize their own egg but razorbills cannot. The size of each species'' repertoire of social signals is related to their nesting dispersion and to the degree of intraspecific social contact.

TI ROLE OF LANDSCAPE FEATURES IN NONSENSE ORIENTATION OF MALLARD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Individual releases of 1500 individual mallard [Anas platyrhynchos] were made in sunny conditions and under total, thick overcast. At short distances, 0.7-14.1 km, ''nonsense'' orientation to the NW was shown only when the sun-compass could operate, and learned landmarks were no substitute for the latter. Landscape features, especially water bodies, did influence the direction of flight and its termination. The degree of familiarity with specific water bodies was important. Time-shifting experiments again indicated that sun-compass orientation had priority over learned landmarks. Although our knowledge of the sensory parameters involved is increased, the function of ''nonsense'' orientation remains obscure.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB To investigate the initial stage of the lost-year puzzle of sea turtle ecology, both hatchlings from the natural nesting ground at Tortuguero, Costa Rica and hatchlings from Tortuguero eggs that had hatched on a beach in Bermuda were tracked individually after their departure from these beaches. Of the Bermuda beach most were tracked by swimmers equipped with face mask and flippers and followed by a boat. Tracking off Tortuguero was done by an observer in a following boat. Non-random departure courses were maintained even when the swimming hatchlings had moved over the horizon from all fixed objects on the shore. Observations were made on swimming and diving behavior and on predator relationships of traveling turtles. The procedures described are useful research techniques and will be used for more extensive tracking in future seasons.

TI MOUNTAIN GAZELLE AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior of mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) in Israel was investigated. Most agonistic encounters occur between members of the same age, sex and social class. Females and immature males did not exhibit the full repertory of display patterns. The intensity of fighting gradually increases as the males mature. However, fights between territorial males are ritualized and not as violent as fights between adult bachelor males. Some encounters, especially among the immature males, take place without recognizable function and situational motivation, while others are linked with the coordination of group activity, enforcement of individual distance and territory establishment and maintenance. Horn contact occurs more frequency in the encounters of immature bachelor males than in those of adults or territorial males.

TI EVALUATION OF USE OF MARKOV MODELS TO DESCRIBE BEHAVIOR OF RATS AT A
   CHOICE POINT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Markov models were used to describe the vacillations of rats at the choice point of a T-maze and to put forward an account of the spontaneous alternation of choices that occurs even following rewarded trials. Rats (3) were given 11 unrewarded trials a day for 12 days. The frequency distribution of VTE''s (vicarious trial and error), defined as head in arm followed by withdrawal, matched the predicted distributions and one of the models considered was consistent with other aspects of the data. When 9 rats were given a single session of 31 trials with food reward except on trials 12-21 and the categories used to define the states of the model were head in arm and choice of arm, a 1st order Markov model gave an adequate description of choice point behavior. But when more detailed categories were used, the transition probabilities were not stationary throughout a trial, so the data were inconsistent with a 1st order Markov model. An appropriate model of choice behavior may depend upon the level of description used. Reward did not have a consistent effect upon the parameters of the models.

TI ROLE OF VISION IN SEA-FINDING ORIENTATION OF GREEN TURTLE (CHELONIA
   MYDAS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sea-finding orientation of the nesting and newly hatched green turtle was tested in the field when the turtles were wearing filter-holding spectacles and when they were in walled or unwalled arenas. The intensity of incident light from different azimuth directions was monitored with a photometer. Sea-finding is primarily a visual process. A direct view of the sea is not necessary. Perception of polarized light or celestial compass cues is not involved. Blurring of images fails to disrupt the orientation. The experiments with color filters indicate that these marine turtles may be less sensitive to red light than are fresh water turtles. Brightness preference rather than color preference appears to form the basis of the guidance system. The principal sea-finding process is inspection of the surrounding landscape and a direction choice based on the relative locations of the open and bright (seaward) horizon versus the darker, elevated outline of dunes and trees.

TI LEARNING OF DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENTS AND MOVEMENT REVERSALS BY MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB After difficulty was encountered in learning reversed movement-directions, 4 cynamolgus monkeys were subjected to an extended training procedure designed so that they might gradually learn this motor behavior and eventually acquire the conceptual response tendency of movement-reversal. Although results on a single pair of positions followed by generalization to additional pairs indicated a high degree of learning in terms of both trials/ reversal and overall percentage of errors, subsequent performance on various transfer and test trials suggests that the continuous improvement was due to the learning of supporting habits rather than the intended concept. Ample opportunity was provided at each critical transfer stage for the demonstration of concept learning, but there were no indications of such a development. The failure in acquisition of the movement-reversal concept is believed to be due to some combination of conceptual difficulty, motor system involvement, plus interference factors specific to the conditions of this investigation. Some suggestive evidence was discussed in connection with the development of irrelevant response tendencies and the most probable factors which contributed to their dominance.

TI ULTRA-SOUNDS IN YOUNG RODENTS .I. CHANGES WITH AGE IN ALBINO MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Pups of albino mice Utters were monitored in the range 60-80 kc/sec with an ultrasound detector, during isolation and retrieving. Quantitative and qualitative changes with age in their ultrasonic calls were analyzed. Numbers of detections rose on the 4th day, i.e. with the opening of the ears, fell practically to zero after the 13th day, i.e. with the opening of the eyes, and were systematically higher during retrieving than during isolation. The frequency (kc/sec) of the ultrasonic calls might decrease with age and, on the 4th day, the calls probably stay at a constant frequency for longer periods than on earlier and later days.

TI ACTIVITY MEASURED BY RUNNING WHEELS AND OBSERVATION DURING OESTROUS
   CYCLE PREGNANCY AND PSEUDOPREGNANCY IN GOLDEN HAMSTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Wheel-running and direct observation of animals in their home cages were used to measure the activity of golden hamsters through the estrous cycle, pregnancy and pseudopregnancy. Both methods showed that the proestrous and estrous days of the cycle were days of increased activity. Levels of wheel-running fell immediately after copulation and were low throughout pregnancy and pseudopregnancy. Except for bar-chewing, categories of behavior scored in the home cages did not show a comparable decline. Nest-building increased during pregnancy. Sleeping was reduced on days 5 and 10 of pregnancy. The differences between the 2 methods of recording activity are discussed, as are the physiological bases of the changes in behavior.

TI SOCIAL FEEDING IN DOMESTIC CHICKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A series of experiments related to the feeding of individual chicks in groups was reported. Experiment I tested the effects of social contact, food deprivation, and group size. Earlier findings that physical contact is necessary for social facilitation were confirmed. Facilitation was maximal at 6 hr. food deprivation: there was little evidence of facilitation at 0 and 24 hr. Facilitation was not enhanced by increasing group size. Experiment n tested the hypothesis that facilitation of feeding could be accounted for in terms of interfering emotional responses. Defecation as an index of emotion in various conditions of social contact did not confirm the hypothesis. Experiment in demonstrated that the feeding behavior of a subject could be manipulated by varying the deprivation of a companion. Experiment IV reinvestigated the effect of group size and the results confirmed those of Experiment I. It was concluded that social facilitation of feeding is the product of some specific form of behavioral interaction.

TI EXPERIMENTS ON NESTING BEHAVIOUR OF LAYSAN + BLACKFOOTED ALBATROSSES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior of the Laysan (Diomedea immutabilis), and black-footed albatross (D. nigripes) was studies on Midway Island. Neither attempts to retrieve a displaced egg or chick. When given a choice, D. immutabilis usually chooses the empty nest rather than a displaced egg, however nigripes usually chooses the egg. Both species usually choose the nest rather than a displaced chick. Given a choice between an egg and a chick on opposite sides of an empty nest, both species usually choose the nest or the egg. A variety of foreign objects substituted in the nest for the egg are accepted and incubated, but the birds choose a normal egg in preference to such objects when given a choice. Relocation of the entire nest is usually not accepted permanently. Intra- and interspecific nest exchanges are usually not accepted. The relation of these responses to the usual pattern of nesting behavior is discussed and interpreted in terms of the ecology of the species.

AB During courtship male D. melanogaster vibrate their wings and this movement sexually stimulates the females. Therefore the effects of changing wing area by various methods was tested. Increased wing area resulted in heightened sexual success and decreased wing area in lowered success, the relationship between the 2 factors being linear. Approximately 80% of the stimulation was found to be via vibration.

TI INDIVIDUAL DISTANCE IN 2 SPECIES OF MACAQUE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations were made on 2 groups of Macaca nemestrina (pigtails) and 2 of Macaca radiata (bonnets), each containing 1 male and 4 females. The records included the durations of passive contact and proximity (within 1 foot) between subjects and each subject''s location in the pen. A significant difference between the species in the durations of passive contact but not in the durations of proximity was obtained. It was shown also that the distribution of the subjects involved considerable reference to selected features of the physical environment as well as to other animals. Regarding individual distance phenomena in monkeys the results of this study suggest that contact and proximity may be manifestations of different underlying systems, and that the tendency towards contact may be species-specific; behavior relating to individual distances between adults may be significant in the ontogeny of the social behavior of their young; and studies of individual distance must take account of the possible coercive effects of the physical environment.

AB Animal signals, while informative, are unlikely to be entirely reliable. Models of such partially honest communication have traditionally taken the form of 'honest-enough' signalling, in which a subset of signallers can signal at lower cost and therefore exaggerate their perceived ability or condition. Although support for these models has been demonstrated, alternatives are rarely tested in nature. Recent theory has highlighted an alternative model that also results in partial reliability, yet functions through a different mechanism. In so-called hybrid equilibria, all signallers pay the same costs given their condition, yet low-quality signallers sometimes spoof the high-quality signal, which receivers sometimes heed and sometimes ignore. Although theoretically well established, documentation of hybrid equilibria in nature is rare. Here, using previously collected behavioural data from the field and literature, we detail a game-theoretic model based on the natural history of hummingbirds. We demonstrate that an unusual female plumage polymorphism found in these birds is best explained as a hybrid equilibrium. In addition to explaining the persistence of polymorphism, the model also offers testable parameters that may predict the wide range of sex variation in plumage found across hummingbirds and other taxa, including bright and dull monomorphism and sexual dimorphism. Ultimately, our findings show that intersexual mimicry can be modelled as a hybrid equilibrium, that hybrid signals likely exist in nature, and that there is the need for a greater diversity of models to explain stable communication.

   PREFERENCES; PERFORMANCE
AB Alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) offer a unique window into how sexual selection can shape cognition and nonreproductive behaviour. Sexual selection more broadly has been shown to shape cognitive traits but has rarely been investigated in the context of ARTs. Furthermore, the divergent morphology and sexual behaviour associated with ARTs may lead to different socioecological challenges (e.g. predation, space use) that further shape nonreproductive behaviours. We take advantage of the behavioural diversity in alternative reproductive tactics among male El Abra swordtails, Xiphophorus nigrensis, to ask how cognition and behaviour diverge between male tactics. We tested courting (large), coercive (small) and mixed-strategy (intermediate-sized) male phenotypes in four assays to evaluate boldness, aggression, exploration, spatial learning and spatiotemporal learning. We found that the courting-only large male phenotype had faster latencies to the reward in the spatial learning assay than the other two male phenotypes and also had greater accuracy than chance. Furthermore, we found that courting phenotypes (large and intermediate-sized males) had greater increases in accuracy over successive trials than the coercive-only small male phenotype. We also found that small, coercive male phenotypes were bolder than large and intermediate-sized males. We found no differences in aggressive behaviour (directed at a mirror) or spatiotemporal learning (shuttle box assay) across the three phenotypes. We suggest that courting males' superior spatial learning abilities may reflect their defence of females at ephemeral foraging patches as well as their need for reliable escape routes from predators. Coercive males' increased boldness may bolster their persistent behaviour and reflect reduced predation pressure. These results suggest that sexual selection for alternative reproductive strategies affects nonreproductive behaviour and cognition in directions that may align with divergent socioecological challenges associated with each mating type.

   CONSEQUENCES; ATTENDANCE
AB To acquire or retain a higher quality breeding site, individuals may occupy sites outside the breeding season, with those investing more time and energy in this benefiting from improved breeding success. However, despite this benefit, the occupancy patterns of individuals may vary. Occupancy may be influenced by the distance individuals travel from breeding sites during the nonbreeding season; individuals nearer the colony may undertake occupancy earlier and more frequently than conspecifics because of shorter commuting distances from migration and foraging locations. Occupancy may also be energetically costly and affect how individuals are able to allocate their time to other key behaviours such as foraging. However, our understanding of how occupancy behaviour relates to an individual's distribution and ability to balance time and energy allocated to other behaviours is limited. Using data from a population of common guillemots, Uria aalge, a colonially breeding seabird, on the Isle of May, U.K., we investigated how nonbreeding occupancy of breeding sites is related to at-sea distribution, and how much energy and time individuals allocate to behaviours throughout the nonbreeding season We used bird-borne geolocators and time-depth recorders to record distribution and estimate time allocated to behaviours including occupancy, flight and foraging. Individuals that remained nearer to the colony before their first return then returned earlier and had shorter bouts of absence thereafter. Individuals also experienced a trade-off in the time spent in occupancy or foraging. Our data allowed us to estimate the increase in foraging efficiency required to offset the lost foraging time in individuals that occupied breeding sites. Overall, despite its known benefits, individuals varied in their timing and pattern of occupancy. We suggest that achieving consistently high breeding success, via nonbreeding season occupancy, may depend on an individual's distribution and ability to forage efficiently throughout the nonbreeding season.

   STRESS; EVOLUTION; BIAS
AB Recent research has used behavioural asymmetries in dogs as an indirect measure of their emotional states from inferred asymmetries in brain activity. Different hypotheses predict differences in behaviour based on emotional salience (right-hemisphere hypothesis), valence (valence hypothesis) or motivation (approach-withdrawal hypothesis). As testing different hypotheses requires having a measure of the consistency of a lateralized response across stimuli of similar emotional significance, we investigated dogs' responses to two emotionally positive and approach-motivating stimuli (food and toy) presented within an apparatus in which dogs could see the positive stimulus (anticipatory phase) before being given access to it. Moreover, to assess the degree to which expressions of lateralized behaviour are similar across different functional responses to an emotionally competent stimulus (and, thus, to explore the generalizability of different hypotheses), biases were analysed both at the level of sensory processing (i.e. lateralized eye use) as well as 'postprocessing' motor action (i.e. lateralized tail-wagging behaviour) during stimulus inspection. Overall, dogs showed a right-eye/left-hemisphere dominance when inspecting the food, but no population level bias for the toy; although they displayed consistent individual level biases. This difference cannot be explained by simply referring to the stimuli with regards to their general emotional salience (right-hemisphere hypothesis), valence (valence hypothesis), or general motivational tendencies (approach-withdrawal hypothesis). In relation to tail wagging, laterality patterns for both stimuli involved considerable inter-/intraindividual variability, with no common directional bias at a population level. Expressions of lateralized activity can therefore vary between sensory perceptual and expressive motor processes. These results suggest that emotion-related behavioural/brain lateralization reflects a complex phenomenon that probably involves processes modulated by multiple factors. The contribution of laterality patterns to informing assessments of animals' emotions might be more limited than generally assumed. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB The Vandenbergh effect, or male-mediated maturation, occurs when females reach sexual maturation upon exposure to a novel male. Male-mediated maturation is found across mammals, including in geladas, Theropithecus gelada, where it may be an adaptive counterstrategy to infanticide that follows the immigration of a new male; maturing after male immigration maximizes a female's chances of weaning her first offspring before the next infanticidal male immigrates (the 'optimal timing hypothesis'). Alternatively, the nonadaptive 'Bruce effect by-product hypothesis' posits that male-mediated maturation in geladas (and possibly other mammals) is triggered by the same physiological changes that, in pregnant females, produce spontaneous abortion (the Bruce effect). We test both hypotheses using theory and observational data. We show that neither male-mediated maturation nor its associated hormonal changes occur in baboons (Papio cynocephalus x Papio anubis), a primate without the Bruce effect. An individual-based model suggests that male-mediated maturation should not evolve via adaptive evolution in either geladas or baboons. Finally, we derive the selection coefficient for malemediated maturation and show it is likely to be very small because male-mediated maturation yields only marginal potential benefits unless the system is extremely fine-tuned. We conclude that malemediated maturation in geladas is a by-product of the Bruce effect and more broadly that the Vandenbergh effect may be nonadaptive.

AB Dispersal is critical to population persistence, colonization and connectivity which are all critical components of invasive success. While individual propensity to disperse varies within populations, the underlying mechanisms promoting individual dispersal remain unclear. Collectively, dispersal is influenced by the environment and individual phenotype. Here we investigated individual dispersal propensity in the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata, and related individual variation in dispersal behaviour to phenotype and social/environmental conditions. Namely, we addressed the effect of sex ratio (social/ environmental factor) on the tendency for individuals to disperse across physical barriers via jumping behaviour. Jumping is vital for the dispersal of many aquatic species and has been anecdotally linked to the guppy's global invasive success. We found similar jumping behaviour for males and females, with population sex ratio not influencing the magnitude of male or female dispersal. Further, we found consistent among-individual variation in jumping probability; individual differences explained 17.46% and 7.92% of total variation in jumping probability for males and females, respectively. These results strongly indicate that sex ratio does not influence jumping behaviour, suggesting that species invasions are mediated by a nonrandom subset of individuals with greater dispersal tendencies. Overall, this study stresses the need to move the focus of invasion biology from the species level to incorporate information on individual variation in behaviour. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB The increasing use of artificial light at night (ALAN) is an anthropogenic disturbance with ecoevolutionary consequences for both nocturnal and diurnal organisms. It has been hypothesized that light pollution could create a 'night-light' niche providing new opportunities for diurnal organisms to forage and reproduce at night, with fitness consequences still scarcely explored. We exposed diurnal parasitoid wasps (Venturia canescens) to control (0 lx), low (0.7 lx) or high (20 lx) intensity of light at night throughout their lives and monitored changes in behavioural and life history traits. Light pollution influenced the night-time activity of wasps, with increased feeding and egg laying at night and a tendency for higher night-time reproductive success under a high intensity of light pollution. Surprisingly, high light pollution also increased the wasps' life span. Light pollution did not significantly affect lifetime reproductive success but did affect the distribution of ovipositions between day and night. Additionally, we showed that reproductive senescence occurred in V. canescens and that offspring development time was influenced by light pollution, in interaction with maternal age. These findings highlight the use of the 'night-light' niche in a diurnal insect exposed to light pollution, with potential implications for population dynamics, especially in natural conditions.

AB Motivation to seek social interactions is inherent to all social species. For instance, even with risk of disease transmission in a recent pandemic, humans sought out frequent in-person social interactions. In other social animals, socialization can be prioritized even over water or food consumption. Zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, are highly gregarious songbirds widely used in behavioural and physiological research. Songbirds, like humans, are vocal learners during development, which rely on intense auditory learning. Aside from supporting song learning, auditory learning further supports individual identification, mate choice and outcome associations in songbirds. To study auditory learning in a laboratory setting, studies often employ operant paradigms with food restriction and reinforcement and require complete social isolation, which can result in stress and other unintended physiological consequences for social species. Thus, in this work, we designed an operant behavioural method leveraging the sociality of zebra finches for goal-directed behaviours. Our approach relies on visual social reinforcement, without depriving the animals of food or social contact. Using this task, we found that visual social reinforcement was a strong motivational drive for operant behaviour. Motivation was sensitive to familiarity towards the stimulus animal and higher when engaging with a familiar versus a novel individual. We further show that this tool can be used to assess auditory discrimination learning using either songs or synthetic pure tones as stimuli. As birds gained experience in the task, they developed a strategy to maximize reward acquisition in spite of receiving more punishment, i.e. liberal response bias. Our operant paradigm provides an alternative to tasks using food reinforcement and could be applied to a variety of highly social species, such as rodents and nonhuman primates.

AB Virtual reality (VR) enables standardized stimuli to provoke behavioural responses in animals; however, in fish studies VR has been limited to either basic virtual simulation projected below the bowl for freely swimming individuals or a simple virtual arena rendered over a large field of view for head-restrained individuals. We developed a novel immersive VR set-up with real-time rendering of animated 3D scenarios, validated in a proof-of-concept study on the behaviour of coral reef postlarval fish. Fish use a variety of cues to select a habitat during the recruitment stage, and to recognize conspecifics and predators, but which visual cues are used remains unknown. We measured behavioural responses of groups of five convict postlarval surgeonfish, Acanthurus triostegus, to simulations of habitats, static or moving shoals of conspecifics, predators and nonaggressive heterospecifics. Postlarval fish were consistently attracted to virtual corals and conspecifics presented statically, but repulsed by their predators (bluefin jacks, Caranx melampygus). When simulated shoals repeatedly passed nearby, they were again attracted by conspecifics, showing a tendency to follow the shoal, whereas they moved repeatedly to the back of the passing predator shoal. They also discriminated between species of similar sizes: they were attracted more to conspecifics than butterflyfish, Forcipiger longirostris, and repulsed more by predators than parrotfish, Scarus psittacus. The quality of visual simulations was high enough to identify visual cues (size, body shape, colour pattern) used by postlarval fish in species recognition. Despite a tracking technology limited to fish 2D positions in the aquarium, preventing the real-time updating of the rendered viewpoint, we could show that VR and modern tracking technologies offer new possibilities to investigate fish behaviour through the quantitative analysis of their physical reactions to highly controlled scenarios.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

ID PREY; DECISIONS
AB Optimal escape models assume that decisions to escape after a predation attempt depend on the initial risk assessment. However, few studies have explored animals' decisions to return to normal activities after their first escape and how the ecological context influences these behaviours. To address these gaps, we investigated the influence of substrate type on escape behaviour and refuge use in the spider Aglaoctenus castaneus. Individuals forage on sheet webs but hide in funnels after detecting potential threats. Spiders from two populations build webs either on injurious substrates that can harm predators or on noninjurious substrates. The dominant injurious substrates include a large thorny palm species in the 'thorny palm' population and a razor grass in the 'razor grass' population. We hypothesized that spiders constructing webs on injurious substrates would (1) display reduced sensitivity to approaching predators by hiding in their funnels and (2) would return to their sheet web more quickly after detecting a predator. We also assessed whether these behaviours were correlated across and within populations and whether they were affected by the social context (couples or solitary individuals). Spiders inhabiting injurious substrates exhibited shorter flight initiation distances (FIDs) compared to those inhabiting noninjurious substrates. Interpopulation variation was observed, with spiders from the thorny palm population displaying shorter FID and lower hiding time than those from the razor grass population. However, there was no correlation between FID and hiding time. Spiders from the thorny palm population showed less sensitivity to predators, probably because thorny palm location was safer than the razor grass location. In conclusion, A. castaneus can adjust risk-taking behaviours depending on the damaging potential of the substrate for predators. We propose new hypotheses with the aim of improving risk assessment research.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 'Cumulative cultural evolution' broadly describes the process by which cultural traits accumulate improvements to efficacy over generations of social learning and innovation. The term can arguably be applied without much controversy to the cultural evolution of tool use, for example. However, it has recently gained momentum in the aesthetic realm as well, where it has been used to describe changes to sexually selected cultural traits. These, the argument goes, can gain efficacy in the sense of evoking stronger emotional responses from receivers. Here, we use examples from birdsong literature to outline our objections to the application of cumulative cultural evolution to cultural traits that achieve popularity based on no standard other than social or sexual preference. Moreover, we distinguish between categories of cultural traits that are preferred for different functional reasons, presenting arguments for or against describing changes to each as improvements. We conclude by proposing that a detailed and nuanced understanding of the mechanisms and outcomes of cultural change is of more service to behavioural and cultural science than a fraught binary distinction between what we can and cannot label 'cumulative'.

AB Animals frequently forage in groups on ephemeral resources to profit from social information and increased efficiency. Greater spear-nosed bats, Phyllostomus hastatus, develop group-specific social calls, which are hypothesized to coordinate social foraging to feed on patchily distributed balsa flowers. To test this, we tagged all members of three social groups of P. hastatus on Isla Col & DBLBOND;on, Panama & DBLBOND;, using high-frequency GPS during a season when balsa had begun to flower. We found that bats commuted 20-30 km to foraging sites, more than double the distance reported previously. In contrast to our expectations, we found that tagged individuals did not commute together, but did join group members in small foraging patches with high densities of flowering balsas on the mainland. We hypothesized that close proximity to group members would increase foraging efficiency if social foraging were used to find flower clusters, but distance between tagged individuals did not predict foraging efficiency or energy expenditure. However, decreased distance among tagged bats positively influenced the time spent outside roosing caves and increased the duration and synchrony of resting. These results suggest that social proximity appears to be more important during resting and that factors other than increased feeding efficiency may structure social relationships of group members while foraging. It appears that, depending on the local resource landscape, these bats have an excellent map even of distant resources and that they use social information only for current patch discovery, and thus, they do not appear to rely on social information during daily foraging.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Eusocial insects operate as an integrated collective with tasks allocated among individuals. This applies also to reproduction, through coordinated mating flights between male and female reproductives. While in some species male sexuals take only a single mating flight and never return, in the western honey bee, Apis mellifera, the male sexuals (drones) live in the colony throughout their lives. Prior research has focused almost exclusively on drone behaviour outside the nest (mating flights), while ignoring the majority of their life, which is spent inside the nest. To understand the in-nest behaviour of drones across their lives, we used the BeesBook tracking system to track 192 individually marked drones continuously for over 20 days, to examine how drones moved and spent time in the nest. In agreement with previous work, we found that drones spend most of their time immobile at the nest periphery. However, we also observed that drones have periods of in-nest hyperactivity, during which they become the most active individuals in the entire colony. This in-nest hyperactivity develops in drones after age 7 days, occurs daily in the afternoon and coincides with drones taking outside trips. We found strong synchronization across the drones in the start/end of activity, such that the drones in the colony exhibited a 'shared activation period'. The duration of the shared activation period depended on the weather; when conditions were suitable for mating flights, the activation period was extended. At the individual level, activation order changed from day to day, suggesting that both the external influence of weather conditions as well as exchange of social information influenced individual activation. Using an accumulation-to-threshold model of drone activation, we show that simulations using social information match experimental observations. These results provide new insight into the in-nest behaviour of drones and how their behaviour reflects their role as the male gametes of the colony.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Remating with the same partner across multiple breeding attempts has been proven a successful strategy for many monogamous breeders across taxa. In birds, especially in migratory species, former partners often reunite at the previous nesting site. As a result, being faithful to a site is closely associated with being faithful to a partner. The long-billed dowitcher, Limnodromus scolopaceus, is a short-distance migrant that breeds in socially monogamous pairs on Arctic tundra. However, unlike all other monogamous species that breed in the same habitat, dowitchers show extreme low site fidelity. In this study, we tracked the annual migratory movements of 21 breeding pairs of long-billed dowitchers in 2019/2020 using 2 g ARGOS satellite transmitters. We estimated the similarity of autumn migration trajectories and showed that former breeding pair members did not have more similar migration routes than random male-female pairs. The space use during autumn stopover and wintering, and the breeding residency area in the following summer, did not overlap between former breeding partners, except for one pair in the autumn and the winter. Mean breeding dispersal was 171 km; true site fidelity was 16.6% for males and zero for females and hence mate fidelity was zero. Our results confirm the exceptionally low site fidelity and the absence of mate fidelity in long-billed dowitchers. Selection favouring site and mate fidelity may be weak for species with mate defence polygamy and uniparental care but should be stronger in socially monogamous systems with biparental care. It remains unclear why the fitness benefits of site and mate familiarity would be smaller for long-billed dowitchers, or why the benefits of yearly flexibility in the choice of a breeding site would outweigh the costs associated with finding a new partner. Given the life history of the species, in particular the fact that former pair members rarely use the same stopover or wintering sites, breeding site fidelity is likely to be a prerequisite for mate fidelity.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Males that employ dynamic courtship displays to attract females may tactically adjust their courtship in response to their social environment. However, we know little about how sexual signals are adjusted in complex natural settings, where individuals are competing for attention against a backdrop of signals from nearby and distant rivals. We investigated this using data from the WildCrickets project, a wild population of field crickets, Gryllus campestris, continuously monitored via CCTV cameras. We used over a million scan samples from 129 males across 51 days to explore how the singing and proximity of other males influenced male singing behaviour. We first quantified the spatial network of the males to un-derstand how the extent of singing overlap is affected by the distance between them, and found a moderate overlap across the whole population, regardless of distance. We then used a finer-grained analysis controlling for the effect of environmental variables. At distances greater than 1 m, we found a stimulatory effect of singing by other males on a focal male's singing behaviour, leading to males singing in the same time intervals. The overlap in singing became weaker as the distance between males increased. Conversely, we found that males were less likely to call when another male was singing very close by (within 1 m), suggesting an inhibitory effect. These findings reveal how, in a dynamic social network in a wild population, males perform fine-scale adjustments to their signalling behaviour in response to signalling by other males both nearby and far away.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Predators differ in various attributes: body size, sociality, speed, preferred prey size, hunting mode, etc. Together, these characteristics contribute to the predator's overall dangerousness, which is likely to underlie variations in the nature and strength of a prey's antipredator responses. This link, although somehow intuitive, has rarely been quantified in natural ecosystems. The goal of this study was to compare the antipredator response of a prey to two predators with contrasting dangerousness in large terrestrial mammals, focusing on the less studied reactive spatial response. We assessed whether the reactive spatial response of plains zebras, Equus quagga, differed after an encounter with African lions, Panthera leo, or spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta. We expected lions to be perceived as more dangerous and hence to induce a stronger reactive spatial response than hyaenas. Using data from GPS collars deployed simultaneously on the three species, we studied the reactive spatial responses of zebras after they came close to either predator. We found that zebras responded differently, and more strongly to lions than to hyaenas. Indeed, zebras were twice as likely to flee after encountering a lion than a hyaena and, immediately after an encounter with a lion, zebras moved on average faster and further than after an encounter with a hyaena. The results of this study are consistent with a correlation between predator dangerousness and the strength of the prey's antipredator response. Future studies covering other pairs of large carnivores are needed to rigorously assess the role of the different predator attributes (body size, speed, preferred prey and hunting mode).& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social group structure often has consequences for individual fitness and ecological and evolutionary processes, but group structure is not fixed because of demographic processes: individuals die, disperse or are recruited into social groups. Thus, it is important to understand how demographic social roles and the loss of individuals with different roles modify group structure. We studied yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer, and performed a series of statistical/topological knockouts on observed marmot social networks to investigate how the social roles of individuals from specific age-sex categories (adult/ yearling, males/females) contribute to group social structure and to ask whether the loss of different roles has varying structural effects. We focused on five central aspects of overall social structure: density, the global clustering coefficient, reciprocity, global degree centrality and the coefficient of variation of strength. Somewhat surprisingly, given that marmots live in matrilines, our knockout results suggested that males played a key role in shaping networks: yearling males were a key cohesive element and adult males were central players in agonistic networks. Thus, social networks are dynamic and their structure is shaped in the interplay of demographic processes and individual social behaviour.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB A major goal of evolutionary biology is to understand how sexual traits arise and diversify among populations. One way to address this objective is by studying sexual traits in closely related species and their hybrids. Here, we used this approach to study the evolution of elaborate behavioural display characteristics used during courtship. We focus on bearded manakins (genus: Manacus), where males of this avian clade perform an acrobatic jump-snap display to court females. Hybridization is common among Manacus taxa, and thus, we studied courtship dance behaviour in a hybrid population between golden-collared manakins, Manacus vitellinus, and white-collared manakins, Manacus candei. We found that, despite being genetically more similar to white-collared manakins, hybrid males performed key dance manoeuvres like golden-collared manakins. Hybrids performed other dance manoeuvres inter-mediate to the two species, or more like their white-collared parents. Select components of the birds' dance routines may have therefore introgressed from the golden-collared population into the white -collared populations. We hypothesize that such modular evolution occurs in response to sexual selec-tion, whereby specific components of the bird's dance routine shift to yield a broader change in its functional appearance.

AB Mate choice is a key driver of evolutionary phenomena such as sexual dimorphism. Social mate choice is studied less often than reproductive mate choice, but for species that exhibit biparental care, choice of a social mate may have important implications for offspring survival and success. Many species make pairing decisions based on size that can lead to population-scale pairing patterns such as assortative and disassortative mating by size. Other size-based pairing patterns, such as females pairing with males larger than themselves, have been commonly studied in humans, but less often studied in nonhuman animal systems. Here we show that sexually size-dimorphic mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, appear to exhibit multiple self-referential pairing patterns when choosing a social mate. Females paired with males that were larger than themselves more often than expected by chance, and they paired with males that were slightly larger than themselves more often than they paired with males that were much larger than themselves. Preference for slightly larger males versus much larger males did not appear to be driven by reproductive benefits as there were no statistically significant differences in reproductive performance between pairs in which males were slightly larger and pairs in which males were much larger than females. Our results indicate that self-referential pairing beyond positive and negative assortment may be common in nonhuman animal systems.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Understanding the development of social relationships, or the process of socialization, can provide in-sights into the processes by which social network structures emerge and vary across species. In this analysis, we investigated the process of network formation from a developmental perspective using data from three groups of wild vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus. We used a dynamic social network approach that allowed us to capture patterns of social change over time. Specifically, we considered the temporal dynamics of two separate interaction networks, spatial and grooming associations, and investigated these patterns between the sexes. We used these data to test predictions derived from a developmental framework on relationship formation put forward by Kohn (2019, Animal Behaviour, 154,1-6). We found that females and males differed in their grooming patterns but were similar in their spatial associations. Furthermore, spatial proximity ego-networks showed seasonal patterns, whereas grooming ego-networks did not. When all relevant centrality measures were considered in concert, we found evidence to suggest that a distinctive network structure forms across the course of development, with ego-networks composed of few strong ties and many weak ties, regardless of behaviour and sex. However, these networks were not produced according to the processes described by Kohn (2019), perhaps because Kohn's framework is concerned mainly with network composition and not structure. Overall, our results provide evidence for social niche construction across development, with the for-mation of a core social 'bubble' of strong ties that can provide a consistent and predictable immediate social environment. More broadly, these patterns suggest that network formation is a process of ongoing adjustment to the social environment, and not an attempt to meet an optimal end goal.

AB Parasitoids need to find their hosts in patchy environments that differ in profitability. To maximize foraging efficiency, parasitoids use volatile information of plants on which their hosts feed. The blend of plant volatiles emitted is affected by genetic variation in plants and by the herbivore species feeding on the plant.How parasitoids deal with variation in plant volatiles induced by host or nonhost herbivores on various plant genotypes in a plant stand is unclear. In a wind tunnel, we examined foraging behaviour of the parasitoid Cotesia glomerata in mixes of white cabbage cultivars with host (Pieris brassicae) and nonhost herbivores (Mamestra brassicae or Delia radicum). We specifically studied the efficiency of parasitoids in locating a host-infested plant when having to pass three other plants that varied in volatile emission by cultivar and herbivore identity. We show that foraging decisions of C. glomerata are affected by the apparency of volatile cues from upwind host-infested plants. We found that parasitoids flew over the first three plants more often when the last plant was a host-infested attractive cultivar and the first three plants were a less attractive cultivar, regardless of the presence of host or nonhost herbivores. Furthermore, parasitoids spent more time on the first three plants if these were infested with host or nonhost larvae, and this effect was stronger when the first three plants were of the attractive cultivar. Our results suggest that parasitoids may more easily locate host herbivores on plant genotypes with more apparent volatile information. However, host location efficiency is affected by the contrast with other plumes of plant volatiles derived from genotypic variation in plants and induction of volatiles by nonhost herbivores.

AB Animals can time their behaviours at predictable intervals. Their precision for doing so, however, may depend on the duration of the intervals. Laboratory experiments with animals show that timing preci-sion decreases in proportion to the duration of the interval, a phenomenon known as scalar timing. In these experiments, animals are trained to wait for arbitrary intervals of time to get rewarded. In nature, animals time intervals as part of many stereotyped behaviours, regardless of whether the intervals are learned. It is unknown whether timing in this context is also scalar. Here, we tested for scalar timing in the song of the scaly-breasted wren, Microcerculus marginatus, which consists of whistles separated by intervals that increase in duration from less than 1 s to more than 10 s. We found that in nearly half of the songs, the timing of whistles was better explained by a model of constant precision rather than one of scalar timing. Moreover, in songs showing support for constant precision, the precision at the longest intervals was higher than that of nonhuman mammals and birds trained in the laboratory for timing presses at an operant device. The precision of the wren is also higher than that of humans, except when the latter count to increase their performance at timing. This study highlights the value of studying natural behaviours to uncover diverse strategies in interval timing among animals.

AB A way of untangling the trade-off between investment in current offspring versus self-maintenance and future reproductive success is to determine how both parents allocate food between themselves and their offspring according to food availability. The hoopoe, Upupa epops, is an excellent model to test hypotheses about these decisions, since it is a central-place forager, a short-lived species and it reproduces successfully in captivity. We created different conditions of food availability (abundant/scarce) at two stages of the nestling period and provided different prey qualities in terms of digestibility and/or size. We hypothesized that parents would prioritize current offspring over their own maintenance. We predicted that (1) parents would offer their nestlings larger/more digestible prey, while they would eat smaller/less digestible prey and (2) when food was scarce, parents would not reduce the amount offered to nestlings. We found that both parents delivered high-quality prey to their nestlings at both stages and ate prey of lower digestibility in the early stage and smaller prey in the late stage. These results support the expectations for central-place foragers, as adults delivered the best prey to nestlings. When food availability was limited, parents at both nestling stages did not reduce the amount of consumed biomass. Despite nestlings receiving similar biomass in both treatments at the early stage, they experienced a reduction in biomass at the late stage when food was scarce. Therefore, hoopoes did not follow the typical strategy of a short-lived species, probably due to energy constraints related to a larger home range and prolonged nestling periods. In addition, females showed a more flexible response than males to changes in food availability, especially at the end of the breeding period. These sex-dependent responses could be related to different parental care investment at this stage when males take care of fledglings until independence and females are preparing for a second clutch.

AB Mimicry has long been a focus of research, but little is known about how and why many species of bird incorporate imitations of heterospecific sounds into their vocal displays. Crucial to understanding mimetic song is determining what sounds are mimicked and in what contexts such mimicry is produced. The superb lyrebird, Menura novaehollandiae, is a large oscine passerine with a lek-like mating system. Both sexes are accurate and versatile vocal mimics of the vocalizations of other species, but little is known about how males deploy their repertoire of mimicked sounds across contexts. Using extended focal watches, we recorded adult males displaying during the breeding season. We found that males mimicked heterospecific songs and nonalarm calls during 'recital' displays usually performed while they were perched and visually inconspicuous. In contrast, during visually conspicuous 'dance' displays, commonly performed on display mounds, males only mimicked heterospecific alarm calls. While much rarer than recital displays, dance displays were associated with the final stages of mate choice preceding copulation. These results provide the first evidence of any species varying its repertoire of mimicked sounds with different sexual contexts. Previous work suggests that mimicry in dance displays functions deceptively to manipulate the antipredator responses of females during the final stages of courtship. However, the structure and context of recital mimicry closely resembles the sexual advertisement song performed by nonmimicking songbirds. Given the importance of mimicry in the acoustic ecology of lyrebirds, our results suggest that with recital song males advertise the quality of their mimicry as it likely benefits both male and female offspring. Our finding that male superb lyrebirds mimic functionally distinct heterospecific vocalizations during different modes of courtship suggests that the evolution and maintenance of avian vocal displays are more complex than previously thought.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Investigating the impact of parasitism on host phenotype is key to understanding parasite transmission ecology, host behavioural ecology and host-parasite coevolution. Previous studies have provided evidence that avian odour is one such phenotypic trait, as mosquitoes that vector the haemosporidian blood parasite Plasmodium tend to prefer birds that are already infected. Preen oil is a major source of avian odour, yet studies to date have not identified differences in preen oil odour based on the presence or absence of haemosporidian infection. Because preen oil can vary with physiological dynamics, we predicted that the composition of preen oil odours might vary according to parasite load, rather than solely by the presence or absence of infection. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to characterize the composition of volatile compounds in preen oil taken from female dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis carolinensis, and asked whether their composition varied with relative haemosporidian parasite load, which we assessed using quantitative PCR. We identified a subset of volatile compounds (a 'blend') and two specific compounds that varied with increasing parasite load. Importantly, the quantity of these compounds did not vary based on parasite presence or absence, suggesting that birds with low parasite loads might be phenotypically indistinguishable from uninfected birds. The volatile blend associated with parasite load also varied with sampling date, suggesting a possible seasonal relapse of chronic infections triggered by shifts in junco host reproductive state. Furthermore, we found a positive relationship between parasite load and a volatile blend shown in a previous study to predict reproductive success in juncos. This is the first study to demonstrate quantitative differences in avian host odour based on haemosporidian parasite load. Our findings highlight the importance of focusing on parasite load, rather than solely presence or absence, in investigating host-parasite interactions.

AB Animals use social information to select and modify mate preferences. Future mate choice decisions for previous partners may depend on the outcomes of their mating interactions. Using meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, we investigated whether their preference for the location of a previous mating encounter would be maintained or modified depending on the outcome of the mating encounter. We conducted preference tests in a T-maze before and after subjects were paired. First, the subjects were allowed to choose between two potential mates and were then paired with their preferred individual for 4 h. They were then returned to an empty T-maze 6 days (males) and 21 days (males and females) following the paired encounter and allowed to explore, during which we recorded the time that individuals spent investigating each section of the maze that previously contained the partner and alternative conspecifics. The outcome of the mating encounters did not cause males to maintain or modify their preference for the location of their partners, 6 days later. Likewise, males and females did not maintain or modify their preferences for the location of their partners, 21 days later, if a barrier prevented them from mating and if they made no mating attempt. This was also exhibited among female subjects whose partners attempted to mate. However, 21 days later (the length of gestation for females), males that successfully mated or attempted to mate maintained their preference for the location of their mate, while females that mated either maintained or modified their preference for the location of their mate depending on whether they produced pups. These results suggest that meadow voles use the information they gain from previous interactions to guide their future mate preferences. Their ability to recall the location of successful mating encounters may be a way to increase their overall fitness. (c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although interspecific interactions appear to be less competitive than intraspecific ones, interspecific territoriality is much more frequent and more stable than is commonly believed. When territorial interactions between competing species are repeated, discrimination between heterospecifics can allow for a more precise allocation of resources and risk. An example of such a strategic approach is the dearenemy effect, according to which individuals are less aggressive to familiar than unfamiliar individuals. We investigated the occurrence of the dear-enemy effect in territorial interactions between two nonpasserine bird species: water rail, Rallus aquaticus, and little crake, Zapornia parva, which compete for food and nest site resources. We used a cross-species playback experiment where water rails received calls of strangers and neighbouring little crakes, while little crakes received calls of water rails in the same manner. In addition, each focal pair was exposed to control calls of little grebes, Tachybaptus ruficollis. In both species, territory holders produced more calls in response to heterospecific strangers than heterospecific neighbours, and the response to control stimuli was the weakest. Furthermore, little crakes often approached and attacked the loudspeakers and mostly when they heard the calls of stranger water rails. Our results indicate that both species were able to distinguish not only each other from the control species, but also specific individuals of the second species. In line with the dear-enemy effect, water rails and little crakes adjusted their territorial response according to the intruder's status, being most aggressive to heterospecific strangers. These findings suggest an adaptive territorial response to resource competition that is commonly confirmed among conspecifics but rarely between individuals of different species.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals may use long-distance foraging trips to capitalize on spatiotemporal variation in food availability, allowing individuals to maximize resource gain from foraging effort. This is particularly important for dimorphic species with polygynous mating where males face strong selection pressures to attain large size and access to reproductive females. We tracked 17 male Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, during their prolonged postbreeding trips and assessed links between their movements and environmental predictors of profitable feeding areas. Males made one of two types of trips: a long trip to the Antarctic ice edge or shorter trips to areas where the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current fronts generate high biological activity. The trip type was not determined by body size but was related to departure date from the breeding area, suggesting that males must trade off opportunities at the breeding area (reproductive, social interactions) and foraging opportunities between breeding seasons. Regardless of trip structure, males focused search effort far from foraging areas of central-place foraging seabirds and seals including female Antarctic fur seals provisioning offspring. Males showed clear spatiotemporal patterns in dive behaviour, with deep dives in shelf waters during the day and predominantly shallower dives in pelagic waters at night. Diel dive patterns showed monthly changes in photoperiod and lunar phase, consistent with feeding on vertically migrating prey. However, males did not use area-restricted search to focus dive effort, instead performing a mix of foraging and nonforaging behaviour within and between restricted search areas. We discuss the scale and type of inference that can be made from movement models, given the behavioural constraints that govern long-distance trips in vast, heterogeneous environments like the Southern Ocean.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sexual coercion is widespread in the animal kingdom. Its direct forms, including harassment and forced copulation, have largely been investigated as an expression of (alternative) male reproductive strategies, rather than the result of a sexual conflict between the sexes. Likewise, the frequent occurrence of forced copulations in orang-utans (Pongo spp.) has been attributed to male strategies and more recently also to concealed female fecundity. So far, however, the immediate contextual variables leading to forced copulations have rarely been examined. We compared two orang-utan populations, Suaq (Pongo abelii, Sumatra) and Tuanan (Pongo pygmaeus, Borneo), both characterized by an individual-based fission fusion lifestyle, whereas their socioecology differs. We assessed how the occurrence of female resisted and voluntary copulations was affected by female reproductive state, male morph (unflanged or flanged), measures of male-male competition, male-female relationship and ecological factors. Besides female reproductive state and male morph, predictors of female resistance were related to male male competition. First, female resistance was more likely towards subordinate males who were displaced from proximity to the female by another male during that association. Second, the presence of additional flanged males increased the probability of female resistance. Third, the latency to both the arrival of another male and to the end of the association after sexual interactions was shorter if there was female resistance. We conclude that sexual coercion in orang-utans is highly dependent on the vicinity of more dominant males and can only be understood in the light of sexual conflict: While males force copulations when at risk of losing access to a female and thus follow a 'now-or-never' strategy, female resistance follows a 'not-you-now' pattern, which is ultimately consistent with an infanticide avoidance strategy.

AB Human activities worldwide are increasingly releasing low-frequency noise into the environment. Anthropogenic noise imposes a novel stress for wild animals and has become an increasing global concern. Many animals have been found to mitigate noise disturbance by modifying their acoustic parameters, yet the calling behaviours of species that breed near airports have not been explored in detail, especially for amphibians. Here, we measured the environmental noise of a swamp close to the runway at Haikou Meilan Airport in China. We also recorded the calls of four anuran species that reproduce in this swamp, and we measured the sound pressure levels of each focal species. These frogs vary in their call amplitude and possess disparate spectral and temporal traits. We show that two frog species characterized by lower frequency calls increase their call frequency when an airplane takes off. Moreover, three anuran species characterized by higher call rates significantly reduce their call rates (or call efforts) in response to airplane flyby. These results suggest that animals' behavioural adaptation to human-made noise may be species specific. Because call frequency and call effort have close relationships with reproductive success, we deduce that such noise-induced behaviour adjustments may influence the fitness of taxa that depend on communication by sound.

AB Courtship songs in mice have been investigated to understand the mechanisms and ecological relevance of vocal communication. There is evidence that courtship song characteristics vary between individuals from different genetic backgrounds, but little is known about whether individuals, even within the same strain, differ consistently from each other in the syntactical composition and complexity of their songs. In a first confirmatory experiment, we aimed to systematically identify syntactical features typical of songs from different mouse strains, by assessing the composition and complexity (i.e. entropy) of the syntax (i.e. how the different syllables are organized within a song) of male laboratory mice from four different strains (Mus musculus f. domestica: C57BL/6J, BALB/c, DBA/2 and B6D2F1). Mice were individually presented with a swab containing fresh female urine for 5 min to elicit courtship songs. The four strains differed not only in the composition but also in the complexity of their syntax. In a second experiment, we investigated repeatability over time as a marker of individuality as well as the occurrence of recurring motifs (i.e. identical sets of syllables that are repeated within a song) of BALB/c and DBA/2 mice. The same procedure as in the first experiment was followed, but in addition testing was repeated weekly over 3 weeks. In both strains, most syllable types showed moderate to high repeatability, indicating individuality in song syntax. However, a descriptive hierarchical cluster analysis indicated remarkable variability in how similar the syntaxes of songs from the same individual were over time. Furthermore, individuals varied in the expression of recurring motifs. Our study shows that not only the genetic background but also individuality can affect variability in courtship songs in mice. Together, these findings raise intriguing questions on whether different individual singing strategies exist during courtship. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Urban animals often show bolder behaviour towards humans than their nonurban conspecifics. How-ever, it is unclear to what extent this difference is due to consistent individual characteristics or to plasticity such as habituation. To address this question, we investigated parental risk-taking behaviour in 371 female great tits in urban and forest populations by checking their nest repeatedly (several times per week, for up to nine breeding episodes) and recording their behavioural responses to this recurring disturbance during incubation. We found that urban females were bolder, as they stayed on the nest more often than females in forests. Furthermore, great tits produced alarm calls around the nests more frequently in urban than in forest habitats. There was no habitat difference in the frequency of an antipredator behaviour, the hissing threat display on the nest, although this was rare in both habitats. We also tested the consistency and plasticity of risk-taking behaviour on three different temporal scales (within breeding attempts, between broods within a year and across years). Staying on the nest was highly repeatable within females, whereas alarm calls had low repeatability within pairs at all three temporal scales. The probability of staying on the nest increased within breeding attempts, whereas the probability of alarm calls increased across years. Neither consistency nor plasticity in these components of risk taking differed between urban and forest habitats. We conclude that urban birds are bolder in multiple behavioural measures and, overall, both stable individual differences and behavioural plasticity may have contributed to the higher risk taking we often see in urban populations. Furthermore, staying on the nest appears to be an individually consistent trait in female great tits regardless of habitat ur-banization, providing a low-impact measurement of risk taking, which may potentially facilitate field studies related to individual differences in behaviour.

AB Sexual signal evolution is shaped by whether only one or both sexes execute mate choice. When mate choice by both sexes is considered, the same signalling modality is generally inferred for males and females. In the noctuid moth Chloridea (Heliothis) virescens (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), both sexes may be signallers and responders, as both emit a sex-specific pheromone. Male mate choice is based on the female sex pheromone, perceived via the antennae, and has been well documented. However, whether females choose partners and whether their choice is based on the male pheromone are unknown. Since female mate choice is expected when males vary in quality, we reared males on two different larval diets that affected their size, which correlated positively with their fitness. When given a choice, more females mated with larger than with smaller males, and these females produced more eggs and larvae. Female choice was not affected by the absolute amount or composition of the male pheromone. Moreover, we found that antennaless females mated as readily as intact females, indicating that antennal sensory input is not required for females to mate. To determine whether females make an active choice, we studied courtship behaviour in detail and observed that females determined the outcome of courtship by moving away from the male (avoidance) or by facilitating copulation with an abdominal bend (acceptance). Additionally, we discovered that tactile sensory stimuli may be involved during courtship. Because tactile interactions may mediate contact-based (chemical) communication, we also investigated putative pheromone components on moth legs, but found no differences between the sexes. Together, our study is the first comprehensive investigation of female mate choice in a heliothine moth. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB Why is polyandry such a common mating behaviour when it exposes females to a range of significant fitness costs? Here, we investigated whether polyandry protects females against reduced male fertility caused by thermal stress from heatwave conditions. Sperm production and function are vulnerable to heat, and heatwave conditions are forecast to increase as our climate warms, so we examined these effects on female reproduction and mating behaviour in the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, a promiscuous ectotherm model in which fertility is damaged by environmental warming. We tested whether polyandrous matings, or polyandrous sperm stores, protect females against reduced male fertility caused by heatwave conditions, and whether females flexibly adjust their remating behaviour to enable fertility rescue. We found that polyandry protected females against reduced male fertility: monogamous matings with males exposed to heatwave conditions halved female offspring production, but opportunities to mate with five of these males allowed normal female reproductive output. By contrast with this fertility improvement following polyandrous mating opportunities, there was no protective benefit for females already carrying sperm stores from multiple males, which suffered similar heatwave damage within the female tract as monogamous sperm stores. Importantly, female polyandry was flexible to male condition, with females showing greater motivation to remate with new males if their previous mate had been damaged by heatwave exposure, enabling a rapid reproductive rescue. Our results reveal that flexible polyandry enables females to rescue their fertility when male reproductive function is compromised by heatwave conditions, a phenomenon that may become more prevalent under climate change.

AB Invasive species often possess a suite of behaviours that increase their likelihood of establishing populations in novel environments. These suites often include combinations of high motility, exploration, aggression, boldness or plasticity in resource use. In Australia, invasive house geckos, Hemidactylus frenatus, have continued to expand their range since the 1960s, spreading from predominantly human disturbed areas to peri-urban regions. Here, we used open-field tests to investigate whether invasive house geckos showed greater exploratory activity and boldness than native Australian house geckos, Gehyra dubia. We expected that, like many other successful invasive species, invasive house geckos would be bolder and show greater exploratory activity than native house geckos. Consistent with our expectations, invasive house geckos showed significantly higher levels of exploratory activity, travelling on average 1.6 times further than native house geckos. However, none of our boldness tests indicated that invasive house geckos were bolder than native house geckos. In addition, we found no influence of sex on exploratory activity or boldness in either species. While invasive house geckos were not bolder than native house geckos, their increased exploratory activity may have contributed to their successful expansion into the natural environments surrounding urbanized areas.

AB The decision to engage in escalated fighting involves an interplay between the individual's estimate of the value of the resource under dispute and the ability of the combatants to invest sufficient time and energy in the contest. Although fallow deer, Dama dama, contests usually take place between pairs of individuals, they are sometimes terminated by the intervention of dominant third-party individuals. Theory argues that these interventions prevent subordinates from gaining a competitive boost via a winner effect; thus, interveners benefit by removing this threat to their status. Prior to intervention, third-party individuals often approach and closely follow the competing dyad before either abandoning their interest in the contest, or physically targeting one of the contestants. This study investigated the possibility that third-party following is an assessment process whereby individuals monitor the quality of fighting rivals during the annual rut. We tested three hypotheses: (1) that third-party followers are socially dominant individuals, that (2) follow contests to assess the current quality of high-ranking rivals (3) when resource abundance (i.e. the number of oestrous females) is high. Our results show that socially dominant individuals are most likely to follow contests; however, contrary to expectation, third-party males tended to follow dyads consisting of low-ranking rivals. We also show that as resource abundance increased in the population there was an increased tendency for males to follow contests, and a reduction in the probability of engaging in a third-party intervention of the contest. As expected by theory, dominance and resource abundance were important correlates of third-party following. Our results support the idea that socially dominant males monitor subordinate males that possess sufficient resources to expend in fighting, and that thus may be a threat to their status.

AB Behaviour is a highly labile trait that can be rapidly modified to mitigate the effects of changing environmental conditions. Among the biotic and abiotic factors acting to prompt plastic responses, the social environment has been proposed as being one of the primary modulating forces on behaviour. Being part of a group has particular influence on the expression of risky behaviour in that added eyes and ears serve to decrease a group member's vulnerability to predation resulting in the mean behavioural expression of behaviours such as activity and/or exploration increasing with group size. A large body of work has documented such group size effects. However, as this process may operate at the individual level it is unclear how the social environment affects the consistent expression of personality. Thus, we examined the interactive effects of behavioural phenotype and social context on the stability of individual behaviour in the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata. Lizards were exposed to a series of assays measuring activity, exploration and boldness in groups of one, two, four and eight. Repeatability was determined across group size treatments and the combined effects of social context and behavioural type on behavioural plasticity were assessed. We found that the predicted patterns of group size effects were only observed when each lizard's behavioural phenotype was considered. Inactive and shy lizards increased their behaviour with increasing group size whereas active and bold lizards exhibited the opposite pattern. Additionally, the degree to which an individual adjusted its behavioural response was contingent upon its behavioural phenotype, with slow lizards showing higher levels of responsiveness than fast lizards. Despite this plasticity, between-individual differences in the expression of activity, exploration and boldness persisted. Thus, our study provides strong evidence that the effects of an individual's personality are stronger than those of group size.

AB Uncertainty can arise in interactions with both social partners and nonliving objects. Previous research has shown that humans display higher aversion to uncertainty arising from social interactions than to uncertainty caused by interactions with objects such as gambling machines, and that this difference may be mediated by betrayal aversion. We investigated whether chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, differentiate between social and nonsocial forms of uncertainty. Subjects participated in two experiments, each involving a social and a nonsocial condition. In both experiments, choosing the safe option resulted in immediate access to low-value food. Choosing the uncertain option could result in access to high-value food, but only if the partner (social condition) or a machine (nonsocial condition) proved trustworthy. In experiment 1, where chimpanzees had no prior information on reciprocation rates (i.e. decided under uncertainty), chimpanzees were less likely to choose the uncertain option when they interacted with a partner than with a machine. When they did choose the uncertain option, chimpanzees also hesitated longer in the social condition. In experiment 2, where chimpanzees had learned the statistical probabilities on reciprocation rates (i.e. decided under risk), they did not distinguish between social and nonsocial situations and were generally risk averse. These results suggest that chimpanzees are more averse to engaging in uncertain choices when the source of uncertainty is a conspecific than when it is a machine; when confronted with risky choices, chimpanzees show no such tendency.

AB Animal personality is defined as consistent individual behaviour over time and across contexts, yet most studies to date only measure behaviour within a single life stage. Up to this point, developmental perspectives in the field of animal personality have received little attention. Here, we review those empirical studies that have assessed personality across major developmental periods, including metamorphosis and/or sexual maturation. We specifically focus on life history differences between direct and indirect development to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying personality development. We also discuss conceptual and methodological inconsistencies across the studies reviewed here that may impede the advancement of animal personality theory. We found that personality traits tend to be stable within life stages but typically are not consistent across critical developmental events (metamorphosis and/or sexual maturation). We conclude that assessing personality within single life stages only provides a snapshot of an individual's behavioural repertoire, while long-term consideration may offer a more complete understanding on the evolution and maintenance of animal personality.

AB Memories linked to specific locations provide information for animals to plan future actions and anticipate the occurrence of events. Here, we examined goal-directed travel towards locations where biologically meaningful events had previously taken place to elucidate the relative importance of past social and ecological information for route planning. We inferred goal-directed travelling by detecting long sections of straight-line travel, followed by significant directional changes along travel trajectories of five neighbouring groups of black howler monkeys, Alouatta pigra, at Palenque National Park, Mexico. Post hoc, we determined at the approached locations: (1) the behaviour of the group; (2) the occurrence of previous intergroup interactions; and (3) the ecological properties of the feeding tree (i.e. importance in diet, level of phenological synchrony). The likelihood of goal-directed travel towards a location to engage in loud calling increased after having experienced an encounter with a neighbouring group at that same location in the past. Additionally, the likelihood of goal-directed travel towards a location to forage on fruits increased when the approached tree was considered important in the diet with highly synchronous phenological cycles. Our results indicate that route planning in wild animals involves an integration of both social and ecological variables. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Paleontologists and biologists generally utilize different lines of evidence and approaches to study, conceptualize and categorize animal behaviour, which has led to a divide between the two disciplines and lack of integration of their data. Numerous filters impact the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record. Here, we utilize 13 broad categories of behaviour representing the range of modern studies of animal behaviour and assess how they are represented in the fossil record. The data summarized in an existing compilation of 'fossil behaviours' is used to estimate the relative occurrence of each category. We also examine the taxonomic coverage of fossil animal behaviour using the same source. We found that feeding and habitat selection-related behaviours were disproportionately represented. Examples of other behavioural categories, especially social ones, such as mating, communication or parenting were considerably rarer, whereas personality or play were not represented at all. Arthropods tended to be most well represented, including insects in amber, followed by vertebrates. Taxonomic coverage was overall fairly diverse. A broader literature search was used to identify the oldest paleontological evidence of each behavioural category. We found that most categories probably appeared by the end of the Cambrian radiation. Finally, we suggest that the preservation of behaviour in fossils can be estimated from first principles, such as the amount of time animals engage in a behaviour or which behaviours impact a substrate. Reconstructing the evolution of behaviour in deep time requires understanding how the fossil record captures behavioural information. We strongly encourage paleontologists and biologists studying behaviour to work together to help complete our understanding of animal behaviour across the entirety of its evolutionary history.

AB Why females mate multiply has been a long-standing question in evolutionary ecology. In attempts to answer this question, many studies on diverse taxa have highlighted various costs and benefits associated with reproduction. However, how the costs of mating differ from the costs of harassment and whether they vary with environmental conditions are unknown. To explore this, we compared various fitness traits of singly mated Callosobruchus maculatus females, with or without access to water, subjected to different levels of male exposure: no male (i.e. no mating or harassment), ablated male present (i.e. harassment only), intact male present (i.e. both mating and harassment), exposure to males for a short time (i.e. repeated mating but with minimal harassment). We found that, overall, females lived longer in wet than in dry environments, and that the effects of male exposure on female life span differed between environments: wet environments showed cumulative costs of harassment and mating, while differing levels of male exposure had no effect in dry environments. Further, while females laid more eggs in dry environments, females mating repeatedly were more fecund than females housed with ablated males in both environments, suggesting both benefits of repeated mating and costs of harassment, which are environmentally independent. Finally, offspring survival was dependent on a complex interaction between environment and male exposure, potentially reflecting environmental differences in resource allocation trade-offs.

AB Latin America was fundamental in the intellectual formation of the founders of modern biology (e.g. Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, Henry Bates and William D. Hamilton), but these pioneers directed their findings primarily to a European audience. Only later did European ethological influence reach Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. From there, the study of behaviour moved to Ecuador and Colombia; Brazilians and Mexicans were further influenced by networks of researchers from the U.S.A. Latin American contributions to ethology and animal behaviour are broadly visible, with a few important centres, especially in Brazil and Mexico. More recently, there also has been a Latin American scientific diaspora, mainly to Europe, U.S.A., Canada and Australia (among other countries), with many ethologists and behavioural scientists becoming active members of the Animal Behavior Society. Latin American scholars, both those who stayed in Latin America and those who are part of the diaspora, have made significant scientific advances, while also demonstrating an ongoing commitment to the development of science in Latin America. Information on the ethology of endemic Latin American species has provided some fundamental theoretical insights, which have also enhanced ethological knowledge.

AB Mating with multiple partners is common across animal taxa. Males mate multiply because reproductive success positively correlates with mating success. In contrast, multiple mating is expected to increase the direct (material) or indirect (genetic) benefits accrued by females but not necessarily increase their reproductive success. Cases in which female reproductive success increases with mating success could be due to females acquiring material resources that directly increase reproductive output. Because multiple mating likely increases reproductive success more in males than in females, males typically experience greater sexual selection. Consequently, males in harem polygynous species, where a few males can monopolize access to several females in a population, are expected to be under stronger sexual selection than females. We field-test these predictions by using the harem polygynous Wellington tree weta, Hemideina crassidens. Here, we develop microsatellite markers for H. crassidens and use them to genotype females, their offspring and putative sires to estimate the opportunity for selection as well as quantify natural rates of multiple mating and its effect on male and female reproductive success (number of hatchlings). We found that both sexes mate multiply and that reproductive success increases with mating success in both sexes. Males and females have similar total opportunities for selection, and sexual selection comprises approximately 50% of the total selection operating in males. We found that female oviposition rate increases with mating success, but we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that females derive indirect benefits from polyandry. Our study provides strong evidence that male and female H. crassidens derive significant direct fitness benefits from multiple mating under natural conditions.

AB Individual animals differ in their responses to external stressors, and sociability has been shown to impact whether or not an individual will avoid a stressor. However, the effect of collective group behaviour on individual avoidance in response to a stressor has not been elucidated. In this study, we sought to determine whether stressor avoidance behaviour in individuals is affected by the behaviour of a familiar shoal, and if social personality is a driver of avoidance behaviour. Bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, were exposed to either carbon dioxide or rising temperatures in a shuttle box choice tank. All bluegill were exposed to a stressor in isolation, then their social personalities were quantified using a social network assay. Bluegill were then exposed to the same stressor in the presence of a familiar shoal, with the entire shoal being able to respond to the stressor. We found that being in a shoal significantly decreased individual avoidance thresholds to both carbon dioxide and temperature, but neither avoidance behaviour in isolation nor individual social personality type was predictive of this response. The presence of the shoal was the primary driver of the difference in avoidance behaviour when bluegill were in isolation versus when they were in groups. Potential mechanisms, both behavioural and physiological, for the relationship between group behaviour and stressor avoidance are discussed. Our results provide evidence that group movements impact individual avoidance of stressors, which may have implications for the behaviour of animals in response to decreasing habitat quality.

AB Chemical communication mediates many social interactions in insects but is still less well understood than other forms of communication. In particular, chemical signalling of social dominance is believed to play an important role in competitive interactions in both sexes, but much of the evidence is correlational. Here we manipulated social dominance and examined its effect on CHC profiles in Telostylinus angusticollis, a fly with a resource defence polygyny mating system. Focal individuals' perception of their own dominance status was manipulated by placing them in an arena with larger or smaller competitors to render them 'subordinate' or 'dominant.' We found that social dominance treatment affected males' and females' social status (quantified as proximity to the larval medium/oviposition dish), as well as their CHC profiles. Dominant individuals tended to have CHC profiles less similar to those of the opposite sex. Moreover, dominant females exhibited an overall elevation of all CHC expression, relative to subordinate females, whereas males that perceived themselves as subordinate exhibited a near-significant down-regulation of male-limited CHCs. Our findings suggest that T. angusticollis males and females alter their CHC profiles in response to their self-perceived social dominance status. These chemical signals could play a role in social interactions both within and between the sexes. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The evolution of group living transformed the history of animal life on earth, yielding substantial selective benefits. Yet, without overcoming fundamental challenges such as how to coordinate movements with conspecifics, animals cannot maintain cohesion, and coordination is thus a prerequisite for the evolution of sociality in nonstationary animals. Although it has been considered that animal groups must coordinate the timing and direction of movements, coordinating speed is also essential to prevent the group from splitting. We investigated speed consensus in homing pigeon, Columba livia, flocks using high-resolution GPS. Despite observable differences in average solo speed (which was positively correlated with bird mass) compromises of up to 6% from the preferred solo speed were made to reach consensus in flocks. These results match theory which suggests that groups fly at an intermediate of solo speeds, which suggests speed averaging. By virtue of minimizing extreme compromises, speed averaging can maximize selective benefits across the group, suggesting shared consensus for group speed could be ubiquitous across taxa. Nevertheless, despite group-wide advantages, contemporary flight models have suggested unequal energetic costs in favour of individuals with intermediate body mass/preferred speed (hence the 'Goldilocks principle').

AB Interfemale competition regimes in primate societies have been described as despotic or egalitarian based on female social behaviour. Hierarchies and nepotism are typical of despotic primates, where dominance rank and kinship are known to be strong drivers of who grooms whom and who fights with whom. However, a general theory for what structures female-female interactions in egalitarian societies remains underdeveloped. We present two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses that each propose a mechanism for levelling social advantages in a group by conferring social favour to all or most females over time: transitory states (age, residency status and reproductive state) bias social interactions and/or reciprocity governs social interactions. In this study, we (1) determined that a group of red colobus monkeys, Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, are highly egalitarian; (2) tested our hypotheses for how egalitarianism may be maintained in this group; and (3) analysed findings across primate studies for support for either hypothesis. In red colobus, agonistic interactions were predicted by age - a transitory state - and transitory states and reciprocity predicted grooming interactions: avid groomers, older females and short-term resident females received more grooming. In addition, behavioural indicators of social status (aggression given and grooming received) were not associated with reproductive success in red colobus, as might be expected in an egalitarian group where variance in fitness should be low. Across primates, we found that transitory states commonly structure social interactions in egalitarian societies but not in despotic societies and that reciprocity is highly variable, especially among egalitarian societies. Rotating social advantage as females shift among transitory states and/or reciprocate grooming may lower interfemale skew in social benefits and potentially in lifetime reproductive success in egalitarian groups, setting them apart from despotic societies where dominance hierarchies and kinship maintain a more static and unequal distribution of social advantage.

AB Reproductive success is often highly skewed in animal populations. Yet the processes leading to this are not always clear. Similarly, connections in animal social networks are often nonrandomly distributed, with some individuals with many connections and others with few, yet whether there are simple explanations for this pattern has not been determined. Numerous social interactions involve dyads embedded within a wider network. As a result, it may be possible to model which individuals accumulate social interactions through a more general understanding of the social network's structure, and how this structure changes over time. We analysed fighting and mating interactions across the breeding season in a population of wild field crickets under surveillance from a network of video cameras. We fitted stochastic actor-oriented models to determine the dynamic process by which networks of cricket fighting and mating interactions form, and how they co-influence each other. We found crickets tended to fight those in close spatial proximity to them and those possessing a mutual connection in the fighting network, and heavier crickets fought more often. We also found that crickets that mated with many others tended to fight less in the following time period. This demonstrates that a mixture of spatial constraints, characteristics of individuals and characteristics of the immediate social environment are key for determining social interactions. The mating interaction network required very few parameters to understand its growth and thus its structure; only homophily by mating success was required to simulate the skew of mating interactions seen in this population. This demonstrates that relatively simple, but dynamic, processes can give highly skewed distributions of mating success. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Behavioural phenotypes are notable for their plasticity, in that individual behaviour patterns can be expressed ephemerally in response to an appropriate stimulus and then disappear. In the absence of an appropriate stimulus, behavioural phenotypes can remain unexpressed over many generations, yet the capacity to perform the behaviour can be retained. Here we discuss potential evolutionary influences of unexpressed behavioural phenotypes using two examples, one from the post-glacial adaptive radiation of the threespine stickleback fish, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and one from a far more ancient radiation, that of Pheidole ants. These radiations demonstrate that unexpressed phenotypes can persist for thousands or more generations in a condition that permits re-expression when an appropriate stimulus appears in the environment. We describe possible explanations for persistence of unexpressed phenotypes and demonstrate that in the absence of an appropriate phylogeny, re-expressed traits could be interpreted as true novelties in the group. We then discuss the way in which loss of expression can lead to parallelism in adaptive radiations - a mechanism that is rarely considered. We conclude by examining the way in which reappearance of unexpressed ancestral traits has the potential to facilitate population persistence if ancestral environments reappear and discuss the reasons that the evolutionary implications of behavioural plasticity are not better studied.

AB Humans have drastically increased the availability of many once-limited nutrients, resulting in potential attraction of animals to now toxic, novel nutritional conditions. For instance, herbivores are attracted to sodium in many terrestrial ecosystems because sodium occurs in much lower concentrations in plants than in animals. However, sodium availability has increased due to crop irrigation or distribution of deicing salts along roads. While moderate increases in once-limited sodium may be beneficial, large increases are potentially toxic. Here, we investigate whether increased sodium along roadsides is functioning as an ecological trap, drawing butterflies to oviposit and forage on plants with toxic levels of sodium. As in many other animals, butterflies exhibit sodium-specific foraging behaviour - males will 'puddle' for minerals on mud, dung or carrion; yet sodium-seeking behaviours at other life stages remain unexplored. We present data from a series of field- and laboratory-based sodium preference trials using both caterpillars and ovipositing adult females. Female monarch and cabbage white butterflies did not show any preference for laying eggs on sodium-enriched plants, either at moderate levels that are likely to be physiologically beneficial, or at potentially toxic levels typical of high-traffic roads. Monarch caterpillars somewhat avoided the plants highest in sodium, but this behaviour is unlikely to compensate for the failure of ovipositing females to avoid toxic high-sodium plants. These results suggest that while butterflies frequently use sodium-enriched roadside habitats, they are unlikely to be seeking out or avoiding these areas due to elevated sodium.

ID PUTTING MECHANISMS; VIOLATIONS; MODELS
AB In humans, as in many other animals, preferences between options can be reversed when other irrelevant options are added to the choice set. Heuristics theories view such puzzling departure from economic rationality as evidence that decisions rely on simple rules that make a context-dependent use of the available information. The computational mechanisms underlying these rules, however, remain largely unresolved. Using a sequential sampling model of decision making, I show that irrational decisions may arise when an information processing mechanism that works optimally in one-choice tasks is co-opted in multiple-choice contexts. The model supports the assumption that different heuristics may sometimes be the elusive expression of a single general mechanism and that natural selection, rather than promoting the evolution of different mechanisms and rules, may favour the parsimonious use of bounded computational resources.

AB Many animals use visual signals to indicate their aggressive intentions. While much research has focused on these signals as predictors of an individual's behavioural motivations, how these social signals are perceived by others and whether social rank influences the response to these signals remain poorly understood. Using the cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher, we investigated how visual signals influence social interactions. To do so, we conducted two experiments in which we manipulated the intensity of facial bars - which are used as a visual threat signal in this species - and assessed how these manipulations influenced social interactions. In experiment 1, we found that N. pulcher displayed less submission towards conspecifics with reduced facial bars compared to conspecifics with enhanced bars, but they did not exhibit an affiliative preference towards either stimuli. In experiment 2, we found that dominant males and large helpers, but not dominant females, performed more aggression towards a conspecific territory intruder with reduced facial bars. Large helpers seemed particularly sensitive to facial bar intensity, performing similar to 4x as much aggression towards intruders with reduced facial bars compared to controls; an increase greater than that of dominants of either sex. Thus, taken together our results show that N. pulcher use facial bar intensity as a measure of the threat imposed by a conspecific, and helpers display high rates of territory defence towards conspecific territory intruders that are likely perceived as less threatening. Visual signals are clearly considered during social interactions, and the responses to such signals can be influenced by one's own social rank.

AB Noise is a form of human-induced rapid environmental change, and mounting evidence suggests that it can affect the sensory environment and consequently the decision-making ability of animals. However, while the effects of anthropogenic noise on individual organisms in the context of movement patterns, foraging and predation risk have been reported, relatively little is known about how noise impacts groups and intraspecific interactions. Here we investigated the effects of anthropogenic noise on grouping preference (i.e. being with conspecifics or alone) in the European hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus. Hermit crabs live in empty gastropod shells and frequently fight with each other to gain an optimal-fitting shell. Thus, crabs' grouping preference may depend on the optimality of their own shell and thus on their motivation to gain another. To test the effect of shell size and its interaction with noise exposure on grouping preferences, crabs were housed in either suboptimal or optimal shells before being exposed to playbacks of either ship noise or an ambient sound (control) and given the choice to group with one or five conspecifics or to remain alone in a neutral zone. Crabs occupying suboptimal shells had a longer latency to enter the zone with a single crab than crabs in optimal shells. This difference was only seen in the ambient sound treatment, disappearing completely under ship noise. Under ambient sound, crabs in optimal shells spent most of their time close to a single crab, while crabs in suboptimal shells showed no clear preference. However, exposure to ship noise reversed the effect of shell quality on grouping preference. Our results demonstrate that exposure to anthropogenic noise can alter not only individual behaviour but also social behaviour.

AB Referential communication provides a sophisticated way in which animals can communicate information about their environment. Previously, research demonstrated that honey bee stop signals encode predator danger in their fundamental frequency and danger context in their duration. Here, we show that these signals also encode danger in their vibrational amplitude. Stop signals elicited by the more dangerous predator, the large hornet (Vespa mandarinia) had significantly 1.5-fold higher vibrational amplitudes than those elicited by the small hornet predator (Vespa velutina). We measured the freezing vibrational response thresholds, and show that natural signals exceed these response thresholds. Finally, with artificial playbacks of the vibratory stop signal, we demonstrate that these signals referentially encode the danger that foragers experience at food source. Stop signals elicited by the larger and significantly more dangerous predator (V. mandarinia) were significantly 1.4-fold more inhibitory than stop signals elicited by the smaller and less dangerous predator (V. velutina).

AB The relative importance of individual and social learning in acquiring complex technological skills in animals is debated, especially the influence of processes allowing high copying fidelity (namely, imitation and teaching). We investigated how immature wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, acquired the technique for extracting underground honey. This technique is interesting because (1) adults perform exploration, pounding and perforation in nonrandom but highly flexible action sequences to locate underground bee nests, (2) they have individual preferences for how to perforate the ground and (3) the nests are deeply buried and concealed, making success difficult to achieve. We analysed the behaviour of 16 immatures recorded by camera traps at 50 sites, and tested the influence of individual attributes (namely, age and sex) and maternal behaviour; we also tested whether mothers provided learning opportunities for their offspring. We found that, as they aged, immatures of both sexes progressively matched adults' behaviour in action sequences and observed their social models more continuously. Immature males used the most common grip type used by adults for perforating (namely, the coordinated use of hands and feet) progressively more as they aged, but no effect of maternal preferences was detected. Thus, the adult technique was probably acquired via a combination of physical maturation (i.e. increased body strength and motor coordination) and observational learning, although individual learning could not be completely ruled out. Finally, the proportion of time mothers spent inactive at bee nest sites was high when they were accompanied by young daughters and decreased as daughters aged, while the opposite pattern was found for sons. Mothers may thus stimulate learning by immatures by adjusting their behaviour according to their offspring's sex and age. Overall, we showed that immature chimpanzees acquired this complex tool use behaviour via a combination of social and nonsocial learning processes, including potential maternal stimulation.

   RESPONSES
AB In some bird species, males and females coordinate their songs into duets. Variation in the level of coordination in these displays may reflect cooperation or conflict. In grey-breasted wood-wrens, Henicorhina leucophrys, both sexes initiate duets with equal frequency, so duets are the product of both male and female behaviour, but the level of coordination in duets varies. This makes them an ideal system to test the motivation of both males and females for answering their partner to form duets. We played back male and female solos and duets to territorial pairs to test for evidence of cooperation or conflict in the use of duets in this species. If duets serve a cooperative function, pairs should coordinate their response to simulated intrusions and respond most strongly to duet playback. If duets reflect conflict, individuals should respond most strongly to same-sex solos. In response to duet playback, pairs approached the speaker together and sang duets at a high rate, suggesting that males and females work cooperatively to defend their territory from an intruding pair. However, females initiated more songs and answered more of their partner's songs in response to female playbacks, supporting the conflict hypothesis. Males also initiated more songs in response to male solo playback, but answer rate was consistently high across all treatments. These results support a growing body of evidence that suggests that duets are multifunctional and may result from both cooperation and conflict within a pair.

AB Signalling is energetically expensive and increases the risk of predation and parasite infection. To balance the costs and benefits of mate attraction, individuals may adopt an alternative mating strategy such as satellite behaviour, in which nonsignalling males will settle near signalling males and attempt to intercept approaching females. While many suggest that alternative strategies are 'making the best of a bad job', little research has examined whether satellites, particularly obligate satellites, have the potential to increase their mating success by preferentially targeting more attractive signallers. Using the Pacific field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, we tested the hypothesis that males are more likely to act as satellites to signalling males with particularly attractive songs, as these callers are likely to attract the most females. In this species, a novel male wing mutation, 'flatwing', renders some males unable to call. Flatwings are obligate satellites, while nonmutated, normal-wing males switch between calling and satellite strategies. We presented males with calling song models varying in the percentage of long-to-short chirps, a characteristic important in female choice. As was shown for females in previous work, flatwings exhibited a strong preference for calling songs composed of 60% long chirp. Normal wing males did not prefer any particular calling song model. Our results lead to the paradoxical conclusion that males with highly attractive songs may not have the highest mating success. Such male preference for male sexual signals may oppose selection by females and increase competition between signalling and satellite males. This could potentially slow the rate of male trait evolution and influence the evolution of male competition. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In some species, especially those that form breeding aggregations, males form groups around females vying for fertilizations. These mating groups are often highly variable in size even during a single breeding event. We examined this variation in the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, a species in which some females (nesting in pairs) attract additional males (satellites) and spawn in groups whereas others spawn only with their attached male. The observed distribution of group sizes often consists of an overabundance of pairs with no satellite males and groups with large numbers of satellites. We characterized this variation using well-known models of count data, such as the Poisson and negative binomial distributions, and evaluated how operational sex ratio (OSR) and pair density contribute to the observed variation. We complemented this descriptive approach with spatially explicit simulations of the group formation process. By comparing our simulation results to the observed breeding aggregation data, we identified how simple behavioural rules might contribute to the variation we observe. Those rules amount to hypotheses about pair and satellite arrival at the beach and satellite sampling of and choice among pairs. We found that the observed variation could be explained by a consistent high frequency of females that attract satellites in combination with males that sample different fractions of the beach as pair density and OSR vary. Furthermore, our simulations suggested that males are not choosy in joining pairs on the beach, despite variation among pairs in the fertilization success satellites can achieve. This suggests that new insights might come from investigating the costs and benefits of male choice and the sensory mechanisms satellite males use to assess the breeding aggregation before coming ashore.

AB Most animals including humans use vision to detect, identify, evaluate and respond to potential prey items in complex environments. Theories predict that predators' visual search performance is better when targets are similar than when targets are dissimilar and require divided attention, and this may contribute to colour pattern polymorphism in prey. Most prey also vary in size, but how size variation influences detectability and search performance of predators that utilize polymorphic prey has received little attention. To evaluate the effect of size variability on prey detection we asked human subjects to search for images of black, grey and striped pygmy grasshoppers presented on computer screens in size-variable (large, medium and small) or in size-invariable (all medium) sequences (populations) against photographs of natural grasshopper habitat. Results showed that size variability either increased or reduced detection of medium-sized targets depending on colour morph. To evaluate whether bias in perceived size varies depending on colour pattern, subjects were asked to discriminate between two grasshopper images of identical size that were presented in pairs against a monochromatic background. Subjects more often incorrectly classified one of the two identical-sized targets as being larger than the other in colour-dimorphic than in monomorphic presentations. The distinctly patterned (striped) morph elicited stronger size perception biases than the dorsally grey or black morphs, and striped grasshoppers were incorrectly classified more often as smaller than grey grasshoppers. The direction of the effect of size variability on detection changed across colour patterns as the bias in perceived size increased. Such joint effects of variation in size and colour pattern on detection and perception can impact the outcome of behavioural and evolutionary interactions between visually oriented predators and their camouflaged prey. This may have consequences for population dynamics, evolution of polymorphisms, community species composition and ecosystem functioning. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To understand how natural selection may act on cognitive processes, it is necessary to reliably determine interindividual variation in cognitive abilities. However, an individual's performance in a cognitive test may be influenced by the social environment. The social environment explains variation between species in cognitive performances, with species that live in larger groups purportedly demonstrating more advanced cognitive abilities. It also explains variation in cognitive performances within species, with larger groups more likely to solve novel problems than smaller groups. Surprisingly, an effect of group size on individual variation in cognitive performance has rarely been investigated and much of our knowledge stems from impaired performance of individuals reared in isolation. Using a within-subjects design we assayed individual learning performance of adult female pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, while housed in groups of three and five. Individuals experienced the group sizes in a different order, but were presented with two spatial discrimination tasks, each with a distinct cue set, in a fixed order. We found that across both tasks individuals housed in the large groups had higher levels of success than individuals housed in the small groups. Individuals had higher levels of success on their second than their first task, irrespective of group size. We suggest that the expression of individual learning performance is responsive to the current social environment but the mechanisms underpinning this relationship require further investigation. Our study demonstrates that it is important to account for an individual's social environment when attempting to characterize cognitive capacities. It also demonstrates the flexibility of an individual's cognitive performance depending on the social context.

AB Thermoregulatory behaviours are of great importance for ectotherms buffering against the impact of temperature extremes. Such behaviours bring not only benefits but also organism level costs such as decreased food availability and foraging efficiency and thus lead to energetic costs and metabolic consequences. However, there remains an important gap in our knowledge to link thermoregulatory behaviour to population level ecological consequences. Aphids, as ectothermic invertebrates, can escape from thermal extremes by either dropping off the plant they are on or moving to suitable microclimates. Here we used the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, as a model system to test the hypothesis that aphids may behaviourally avoid heat stress while also altering their microhabitat utilization leading to demographic consequences. We found that heat stress drove the aphids to leave their host plant; this reduction in host plant residence was associated with increasing leaf temperatures indicating that aphids exhibit thermoregulatory behaviour to escape heat stress. Specifically, we found that behavioural thermoregulation made the aphids disperse and redistribute themselves within different microclimates and thus led to changes in microhabitat utilization. We also discovered that leaving the host plant during behavioural thermoregulation resulted in a considerable decrease in aphids' survival probability due to their inefficient relocation to other plants and increased risk of starvation. Finally, we found that the aphids' thermoregulatory behaviour prevented heat stress while concurrently resulting in decreased survival and reproduction. Together, these findings support our hypothesis that behavioural thermoregulation alters microhabitat utilization and demographic rates in aphids. This study highlights the importance of behavioural thermoregulation and its ecological consequences and has important implications for understanding population responses in the context of current climate change.

AB Social network analyses allow researchers to describe patterns of social interactions and their consequences in animal societies. Since direct observations in natural settings are often difficult, researchers often use tracking technologies to build proximity-based social networks. However, because both social behaviour (e.g. conspecific attraction) and environmental heterogeneity (e.g. resources attracting individuals independently) affect rates of interaction, identifying the processes that shape social networks is challenging. We tracked sleepy lizards, Tiliqua rugosa, using global positioning system (GPS) telemetry to investigate whether they show conspecific attraction or avoidance beyond any shared space use driven by environmental heterogeneity. Since these lizards have strong pair bonds and nonoverlapping core home ranges, we predicted different interaction rates between inter- and intrasex dyads and compared social network indices among dyad types (male-male, female-female and intersex) using node-identity permutation tests. We also mapped interactions onto the home ranges (using distance from the centre as an index) and contrasted observed social networks with those expected from a spatially explicit null model. We found that dyad types differed in their interaction patterns. Intersex dyads had stronger connections (higher edge weight) than a null expectation, and stronger than for same-sex dyads. Same-sex dyads did not differ in edge weight from the null expectation, but were significantly more common (higher degree). Males had larger home ranges than females and consequently male-male dyads interacted further away from their home range centres. Moreover, the locations of these interactions also differed from the null expectations more strongly than other dyad types. Hence, we conclude that males predominantly interacted with each other at the peripheries of their home range, presumably reflecting territorial behaviour. By applying a novel analysis technique, we accounted for the nonsocial component of space use and revealed sex-specific interaction patterns and the contribution of conspecific attraction to the social structure in this species. More generally we report how mapping the locations of nonrandom interaction rates provides broad information on the behaviours they represent.

AB Egg size reflects the amount of energy that female parents have invested in their offspring prior to hatching, and is thus often used as a proxy for prehatching investment. According to life history theory, prehatching investment, in turn, trades off with posthatching investment, as the amount of resources allocated at the prehatching stage diminishes the resources available at the posthatching stage. As small eggs have smaller energy reserves than large eggs, the offspring originating from small eggs may have higher hunger levels, and thus beg more, offering the parents information about the need for more posthatching care. However, little is known about the relationship between egg size and begging behaviour, and the fitness correlates of the two. In this study, we directly investigated the association between these two traits in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. Concurrently, we examined the effects of egg size on two components of offspring fitness: offspring growth and survival. We found no association between egg size and offspring begging behaviour. Egg size did, however, show a mostly positive, albeit indirect, association with offspring fitness traits (development time, size and survival). Therefore, an increase in egg size does have an impact on offspring fitness, but this impact is not mediated through offspring begging. To our knowledge, this is the first time the relationship between egg size and begging behaviour has been investigated directly.

AB A periodic dayenight environment is critical for daily behavioural patterns and advanced brain functions such as learning and cognition in animals. We investigated whether a no-night light environment would impair these functions in parent and F1 and F2 zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Particularly, we examined song acquisition as a measure of learning, tested cognitive performance with reference to spatial and colour association tasks, and assessed personality with respect to an exploratory trait, first in the parent (P) and subsequently in F1 and F2 birds born and raised under 12:12 h light:dark or constant light (hence no-night, LL) environments. Daily patterns in activity and singing were monitored as circadian response indicators. After initial decay, the rhythmic patterns in daily activity and singing were restored after several weeks in the majority of P and F1 birds under LL; F2 birds displayed robust circadian rhythms in both behavioural patterns under LL. Further, LL decreased participation and performance in cognitive tests and reduced exploratory behaviour in birds from all generations. Overall, we found negative effects of the LL environment on daily behavioural patterns, advanced brain functions (i. e. learning and cognition) and personality in zebra finches when adult and in subsequent generations. These results give insights into the possible impact on animals of night-time illumination such as in an overly lit urban habitat. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Boldness, the willingness of individuals to engage in risky behaviour, is one of the most studied personality traits. It has been measured using a variety of tests; however, measuring a behaviour using different assays may lead to a jingle fallacy. The few studies that have attempted to determine whether these different assays are comparable have produced mixed results. A lack of repeatability between boldness measures under standardized and natural conditions may be the source of this variation. Here, we tested whether risk-taking behaviour of free-living African striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, measured in a laboratory using open field tests is comparable with measures of risk-taking behaviour from startle tests. These measures were then compared with measures of risk-taking behaviour obtained from equivalent open field and startle tests performed on the same individuals under natural conditions. During open field tests, we assessed the time an individual spent away from the wall of the arena (in the laboratory) or from its nest (in nature). During startle tests, we measured the latency to re-emerge from either a protective box (in the laboratory) or a nest (under natural conditions) after an individual was scared away. Our results showed that risk-taking behaviour measured using the open field and the startle tests were repeatable within the same context (tested twice per assay) and across contexts (laboratory, nature). However, open field measures of risk-taking behaviour were not correlated with startle measures, supporting the idea that the two tests are assaying different personality traits. The variations in the outcome observed in the two assays probably resulted from the presentation of threatening stimuli in the startle test. We propose that, at least in striped mice, the startle test is more suitable for measuring anxiety than boldness. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Prey species may adjust their use of antipredator behaviours to counter the hunting strategies (e.g. ambush versus cursorial) and the level of risk imposed by different predators. Studies of suites of behaviours across well-defined contrasts of predation risk and type are rare, however. Here we explored the degree to which six herbivore species adjusted their antipredator behaviours to two predator treatments (lion, Panthera leo, versus cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, and wild dogs, Lycaon pictus). We focused on prey behaviour (vigilance, grouping, temporal use) at waterholes. We predicted that if the hunting strategy of the predator was the key driver of antipredator behaviour, ambushing lions would elicit a greater response than cursorial cheetah and wild dogs. Alternatively, if predator preference was the main driver, then we expected prey species to adjust their antipredator behaviours in response to the predators that specifically target them (i.e. preferred prey of the different predators). Overall, we found that the herbivores maintained greater vigilance, generally moved in larger groups and used waterholes less at dawn, at dusk or at night (when lions are active) when exposed to the potential threat of ambushing lions. However, some species within the accessible prey range of cheetah and/or wild dogs (i.e. red hartebeest, warthog, gemsbok) moved in larger groups when exposed to these predators. Yet, the magnitude of the differences in group size for these herbivores were small. Thus, we suggest that, overall, the potential threat of ambushing lions was the main driver of antipredator behaviour around waterholes, probably determined by prey weight preference and the possibility of being ambushed.

AB Many species form social groups with dominance hierarchies. Often, individuals possess a status signal that indicates dominance rank. Songbirds produce songs that are used to attract mates or repel rivals, and acoustic features within songs can also indicate an individual's quality, including dominance rank. Acoustic status signals have been reported in the songs of male black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, a nonmigratory North American songbird. Here we used two operant conditioning tasks to examine acoustic preference for and discrimination of conspecific songs produced by males varying in dominance rank. We used a choice preference task to examine birds' preferences for listening to dominant or subordinate songs and conducted an instrumental learning task to determine whether chickadees considered dominant and subordinate songs as belonging to separate signal categories based on acoustic features. Overall, our results provide little evidence that birds used open-ended categorization when discriminating, but there is evidence that songs from different geographical regions may contain acoustic similarity based on dominance rank. Consistent with previous song discrimination studies with black-capped chickadees, we found sex differences in discrimination abilities, with females learning the discrimination faster than males. We also found evidence that performance accuracy during the instrumental learning task correlates with acoustic song preference. Overall, these results suggest that when biologically relevant signals (e.g. male songs) are used as stimuli during a perceptual task, the birds' responses may be differentially affected based on individual differences among the subjects performing the task (including sex and underlying preference) and the salience associated with the stimuli (e.g. dominance rank of the singer).

AB A group's composition is important for its success. Colonies of the spider Anelosimus studiosus appear to have responded to this pressure by evolving the ability to maintain mixtures of docile versus aggressive individuals that help colonies avoid extinction. Here we demonstrate that colony extinction events unite the optimal group composition of all colony constituents, regardless of phenotype, with that of the colony as a whole. This is because colony extinction events explain the majority of individual mortality events in A. studiosus. Through within-and across-habitat colony manipulations, we further determined that reduction in reproductive output by individuals bearing overabundant phenotypes underlies the ability of colonies to adaptively regulate their compositions. When we experimentally created colonies with an overabundance of the docile or aggressive phenotype, individuals bearing the overabundant phenotype exhibited reduced reproductive output, which helped to move colony compositions back towards their site-specific optima. Colonies displaced from their native sites continued to recreate the patterns of reproductive output that characterized their site of origin, suggesting a genetic component to this trait. Individuals thus appear to adaptively cull their reproductive output depending on their phenotype and the composition of their colony. There is also considerable parent-offspring colony resemblance in the extent to which colonies can or do track their ideal compositions. This conveys a kind of collective heritability to this trait. Together, while group selection appears to be the principal driver of ongoing selection on group composition in A. studiosus, patterns of selection among individuals within groups appear to promote colonies' ability to track their ideal mixtures.

AB Despite the many study systems in which predation has played a major role in phenotypic diversification and speciation, the underlying selective regimes imposed by different predator assemblages have rarely been quantified. We did so for the damselfly genus Enallagma which strongly diverged in antipredator traits when the ancestral species occupying lakes containing fish (hereafter fish lakes) repeatedly invaded fishless lakes with dragonfly larvae as top predators (hereafter dragonfly lakes). In two selection experiments in field enclosures we quantified the selection on two key escape traits of two fish-lake Enallagma species associated with survival selection by fish in the ancestral fish lakes and by dragonfly predators in the invaded fishless, dragonfly lakes. In accordance with the different hunting modes, fish imposed selection for a decreased swimming propensity while dragonfly larvae imposed selection for increased swimming speed in one of the two species. In two complementary quantitative genetic rearing experiments, we found relatively low but significant broad-sense heritabilities for both escape traits. Integrating these estimates for the selection coefficients and the heritabilities suggests that the evolutionary increase in swimming speed associated with the habitat shift may have occurred rapidly. Our study suggests that the phenotypic evolution of ecologically important traits related to habitat shifts may occur at an ecological timescale.

AB In many areas of animal behaviour research, improvements in our ability to collect large and detailed data sets are outstripping our ability to analyse them. These diverse, complex and often highdimensional data sets exhibit nonlinear dependencies and unknown interactions across multiple variables, and may fail to conform to the assumptions of many classical statistical methods. The field of machine learning provides methodologies that are ideally suited to the task of extracting knowledge from these data. In this review, we aim to introduce animal behaviourists unfamiliar with machine learning (ML) to the promise of these techniques for the analysis of complex behavioural data. We start by describing the rationale behind ML and review a number of animal behaviour studies where ML has been successfully deployed. The ML framework is then introduced by presenting several unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Following this overview, we illustrate key ML approaches by developing data analytical pipelines for three different case studies that exemplify the types of behavioural and ecological questions ML can address. The first uses a large number of spectral and morphological characteristics that describe the appearance of pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, eggs to assign them to putative clutches. The second takes a continuous data stream of feeder visits from PIT (passive integrated transponder)-tagged jackdaws, Corvus monedula, and extracts foraging events from it, which permits the construction of social networks. Our final example uses aerial images to train a classifier that detects the presence of wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, to count individuals in a population. With the advent of cheaper sensing and tracking technologies an unprecedented amount of data on animal behaviour is becoming available. We believe that ML will play a central role in translating these data into scientific knowledge and become a useful addition to the animal behaviourist's analytical toolkit. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB This essay focuses on a dozen predictions from a previous analysis of the evolution of communication in the presence of noise. First of all, (1) noise creates an unavoidable trade-off between two kinds of error by receivers. Furthermore, (2) a receiver's optimal criterion for response depends on the level of signals and (3) a signaller's optimal level of signalling depends on the receiver's criterion. As a result, (4) communication in noise can evolve to a joint optimum. (5) Communication at a joint optimum is honest on average. (6) Joint optima for communication in noise do not eliminate noise. (7) Many parameters of communication in noise remain poorly studied. (8) Noise leads to strong predictions for the evolution of exaggeration and thresholds. (9) Signals for advertising and for warning are contrasts in probable costs of errors. (10) The evolution of new signals and responses encounters a hurdle. (11) New signals and responses can evolve by exploitation. (12) Joint evolution of signallers and receivers has a predictable direction. These predictions will remain untested hypotheses until communication in noise is studied more thoroughly than it has been previously. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Cognition is one of the mechanisms underlying behavioural flexibility, but flexibility of cognition itself may vary as a result of trade-offs between the ability to learn new information and the ability to retain old memories. How and when cognitive flexibility is constrained by this trade-off remains poorly understood. We investigated cognitive flexibility in wild food-caching mountain chickadees, Poecile gambeli, at different elevations experiencing different levels of environmental harshness during the nonbreeding season, using a spatial learning and memory reversal paradigm. There were no significant differences in sampling strategies between elevations, but high-elevation chickadees performed worse than low-elevation chickadees on the reversal task, indicating lower cognitive flexibility. Compared to the initial learning task, low-elevation chickadees improved their performance during the reversal task, while high-elevation chickadees performed worse. High-elevation birds inspected previously rewarding locations more frequently than other locations, suggesting that reduced cognitive flexibility is associated with proactive interference. Considering that high-elevation chickadees cache more food and are likely more dependent on these caches than their conspecifics from low elevation, and that chickadees from both elevations use similar sampling strategies, our findings suggest that stronger memories of more caches might interfere with acquisition and retention of new memories. Overall, our results suggest that predictably harsh environments might favour stronger memories at the expense of decreased cognitive flexibility, which is likely driven by increased proactive interference.

ID APHAENOGASTER; INSECT
AB Tool use by nonhuman animals has received much research attention in the last couple of decades. Nevertheless, research has focused mostly on vertebrates, particularly primates and corvids, even though tool use has also been documented in insects. One of the best documented examples involves ants using debris (e. g. sand grains, mud, leaf fragments) to collect and transport liquid food to their nest. However, little is known about the factors that determine the selection of materials to be used as tools. We investigated tool selection in two species of Aphaenogaster ants by giving them the choice between different kinds of potential tools (natural and artificial objects). Ant workers showed a clear preference for certain materials to be used as tool objects. Tool selection was also shaped by familiarity with the material as ants developed a preference for artificial tools with a good soaking capacity that cannot be found in their natural environment. Our results indicate that ants of this genus have evolved unique foraging strategies and show plasticity in their behaviour.

AB Microplastics are ubiquitous in the marine environment. Their small size makes them bioavailable to a range of organisms and studies have reported ingestion across the food chain. Few studies have demonstrated physical transfer of microplastics between organisms, and no research has assessed the ecological impacts of transferred microplastics and contaminants over different trophic levels. Contaminants associated with plastics can alter animal behaviour; thus, exploring changes in behaviour may be fundamental in understanding ecosystem effects of microplastics. This study explored the effects of microplastics and associated contaminants through the food chain in the marine intertidal zone. We exposed beach hoppers, Platorchestia smithi, to environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics and then fed them to Krefft's frillgobies, Bathygobius krefftii, ray-finned fish that inhabit shallow coastal ecosystems. We tested fish personality to see whether there were any changes that could be attributed to trophic transfer of microplastics, as even subtle changes in behaviour can have cascading effects on other organisms and the wider ecosystem. Exploring behavioural changes in response to contaminant exposure is a developing area in ecotoxicology due to its increased sensitivity compared with the traditional LD50 approach. While gobies readily ingested contaminated beach hoppers, we detected no effect of microplastic trophic transfer on fish personality relative to control groups. While chronic exposure studies assessing a suite of behaviours are required, it is possible that the transfer of microplastics via trophic interactions does not provide an additional exposure pathway for contaminants through the food web.

AB Climate-mediated range shifts into eco-evolutionary novel habitats have the potential to alter the ecology and behaviour of range-expanding species. Of particular concern are behaviours that have a strong impact on the ecology and life history of expanding species. Behaviours that control the spatial patterns of habitat use may be particularly important. We examined site fidelity and foraging foray behaviour of the mangrove tree crab, Aratus pisonii, in its historic mangrove habitat and the recently colonized eco-evolutionary novel salt marsh. In the mangrove, A. pisonii showed both strong site fidelity to individual trees and a foraging pattern wherein they made foraging forays that decreased in frequency as their distance from the home tree increased; but they displayed neither behaviour in the salt marsh. Chemical cues from faeces appear to be the mechanism behind site fidelity in the mangrove and may suggest the mechanism for the loss of this behaviour in the salt marsh where substrate is regularly submerged, potentially preventing establishment of such cues. The loss of site fidelity may affect the foraging behaviour and predation risk of A. pisonii in the salt marsh, leading to a shift in its ecology and bioenergetics. As more species are forced to shift ranges into eco-evolutionary novel habitats, it is important to understand how this shift may affect their life history, behaviour and ecology in indirect ways.

AB In cognitive tests, animals are often given a choice between two options and obtain a reward if they choose correctly. We investigated whether task format affects subjects' performance in a physical cognition test. In experiment 1, a two-choice memory test, 15 marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, had to remember the location of a food reward over time delays of increasing duration. We predicted that their performance would decline with increasing delay, but this was not found. One possible explanation was that the subjects were not sufficiently motivated to choose correctly when presented with only two options because in each trial they had a 50% chance of being rewarded. In experiment 2, we explored this possibility by testing eight naive marmosets and seven squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sciureus, with both the traditional two-choice and a new nine-choice version of the memory test that increased the cost of a wrong choice. We found that task format affected the monkeys' performance. When choosing between nine options, both species performed better and their performance declined as delays became longer. Our results suggest that the two-choice format compromises the assessment of physical cognition, at least in memory tests with these New World monkeys, whereas providing more options, which decreases the probability of obtaining a reward when making a random guess, improves both performance and measurement validity of memory. Our findings suggest that two-choice tasks should be used with caution in comparisons within and across species because they are prone to motivational biases.

AB To study the functional role of the predisposed preference for Johansson's biological motion (BM) at an early stage of life, newly hatched domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, were exposed to a variety of motion pictures composed of light points (in red or yellow), and then tested for their learned colour preference. Point-light animations depicting the BM of a walking hen successfully facilitated both the approach activity during imprinting and the learned preference in the test, although significant positive correlations did not appear between these at the individual level. Furthermore, scrambling the light points did not significantly reduce the effects, whereas linear motion of a hen-shaped set of points had no effect. If pretreated with the linear motion, those chicks primed with a high BM preference score showed a high learning score in subsequent imprinting. We conclude that the local movement feature of the BM animation is critical in making chicks approach and learn the associated colour. We propose a scenario wherein naive chicks have an innate preference for BM, which arises prior to imprinting through nonspecific visual experience in the early posthatch period. The induced BM preference then allows chicks to form a learned colour preference for the associated colour more effectively, leading to the development of tighter social attachment.

AB Underwater sound generated by human activities is increasing in, on and near aquatic environments. Such anthropogenic noise can induce artificially elevated ambient sound levels and cause various detrimental effects in fish, such as temporary or permanent hearing loss, masking of relevant acoustic signals and cues or behavioural changes that may have fitness consequences. Also, captive fish are often exposed to noisy conditions, which may have consequences for production in aquaculture, biases in scientific results in laboratories or welfare in hobby aquaria. However, we still have limited insight into how fish cope with artificial sound exposure and how species differ in sensitivity. Here, we compared zebrafish, Danio rerio, and Lake Victoria cichlids, Haplochromis piceatus, the former being sensitive to lower absolute thresholds and wider spectral ranges than the latter. Experimental sound exposure induced a significant reduction in swimming speed in the first minute of exposure for both species in captive conditions. Furthermore, zebrafish showed clear startle response behaviour with the onset of the sound exposure leading to an initial, brief increase in swimming speed, which was not found for the cichlids. Neither species showed spatial shifts away from the active speaker in the horizontal plane, but cichlids shifted downwards to spend more time in the bottom area of the fish tank after the onset of sound exposure, while zebrafish retained their average swimming height during the same exposure levels. Our results show that sound exposure can cause both similar and species-specific responses in two fish species and that these responses are not obviously related to differences in their hearing ability.

AB Many shark species form groups; yet the drivers of this behaviour are not well understood. Aggregations have been presumed to be a function of resource availability or phenology. However, recent studies have suggested that some sharks display preferences in their associations with conspecifics and that complex social networks may underpin their movement patterns, demographic distribution and fitness. This study used a network approach to investigate patterns of sociality of a benthic predator, the spotted wobbegong shark, Orectolobus maculatus (Family Orectolobidae), in a small marine reserve. Spatial data obtained from fine-scale passive acoustic telemetry were used to infer association preferences of 15 tagged sharks over a 15-month period. Thirty-five associating dyads emerged, with permutation tests indicating that these were nonrandomly formed. Many dyads were temporally stable, with some persisting even after sharks returned to the reserve from their seasonal migration. A complete but sparse network was observed and although association patterns were evident at the dyadic level, indication of stable communities or network structure was limited. The population was not found to be gregarious and exclusive pairs were not observed, with 14 sharks associating with more than one individual. Assortative mixing (by sex, size and familiarity) was not present and range overlap did not strongly correlate with association indices. This suggests that these relationships are not a random result of nonsocial grouping behaviours but can be explained, at least in part, by genuine social affiliation. As such, anthropogenic influences on the population may have more complex impacts than previously thought. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sexual coercion results from extreme conflict over mating. As a male strategy to overcome female resistance, coercion can impose fitness costs on females. Among mammals, most cases involve single males or temporary coalitions, with allied aggression towards females being rare. Among Shark Bay bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops cf. aduncus, male alliances harass, guard and consort with females to obtain mating access, which has known physical costs to females. However, the behavioural and ecological costs of sexual coercion to females remain largely unexplored. Given the importance of individual differences in ranging and habitat use for dolphin foraging ecology, social networks and fitness, we hypothesized that male coercion also imposes ecological costs on females. Using 25 years of longitudinal data, we examined how adult male presence relates to female space use, and we found that females (N = 32) altered their ranging when associating with adult males but also when they were cycling. Additionally, females reduced the use of their primary (preferred) habitat when with males, but cycling had no effect. Ranging shifts were slightly greater for males than for females when they were together, but only for females did this alter their spatial ecology. While it is also possible that males follow fertile females and/or that females move to avoid males, the well-documented coercive mating system suggests that males, as part of their coercive mating tactics, sequester females to areas that females would not otherwise occupy. Our results show that in a coercive mating system, males can alter females' basic behavioural ecology, and suggest that males spatially sequester individual females via allied consortships.

AB Parasitoids face several hurdles and distractions while foraging for their hosts, one of which is the presence of nonhost herbivores. Nonhost herbivores may interfere with plant volatile-mediated location of host-infested plants and reduce encounter rates with hosts on the plant. This results in a lower foraging efficiency. In this study, we tested whether the feeding position of a host and nonhost herbivore on the same plant influences foraging decisions and parasitism efficiency of parasitoids. We confined host and nonhost herbivores to either higher positions, i.e. younger leaves (preferred by the host) or lower positions on the plant, i.e. older leaves (preferred by the nonhost). Host and nonhost herbivores fed either on separate leaves or on the same leaf. Results from laboratory experiments show that during the first phase of foraging when plant volatiles are used to locate a host-infested plant, parasitoids were misled when host and nonhost were positioned in an unnatural way on the individual plant (host on the older leaves). The positions of host and nonhost partly influenced parasitoids during the second phase of foraging, when the host is located on the plant by using host cues. Total host-finding efficiency, as tested in a semifield set-up, was not affected by herbivore position. We conclude that parasitoid foraging behaviour has enough flexibility to overcome constraints resulting from an unexpected distribution of herbivores over a plant.

AB Reproductive and agonistic behaviours typically diverge between individuals pursuing alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). When tactics are fixed for life, evolutionary theory predicts that the relative frequencies of alternative male genotypes are stabilized in a population by negative frequency dependence. This implies that competition is greatest between males pursuing the same tactic. The cichlid fish Lamprologus callipterus exhibits three male ARTs involving fixed and flexible tactics, and an extreme intrasexual size dimorphism determined by Mendelian inheritance. Large nest males defend territories and construct nests of empty snail shells in which females breed. In contrast, dwarf males pursuing a genetically fixed parasitic tactic enter shells surreptitiously during spawning in order to steal fertilizations. Sneaker males using another parasitic tactic, which is plastic and conditional, steal fertilizations opportunistically during spawning by quick intrusions into the nest. The variation in tactic origin and reproductive behaviour and the substantial asymmetry in body size render L. callipterus an ideal model system to study theoretical predictions regarding the types and intensity of contest behaviours among conspecific competitors pursuing ARTs. In an experiment exposing males to competitors using either the same or a different tactic, within-tactic competition was much more intense than between-tactic competition in bourgeois males, as predicted by evolutionary theory. In addition, the level of aggression displayed by bourgeois males against male intruders was apparently triggered by perceived differences in body size. In contrast to bourgeois males, parasitic males showed hardly any aggressive behaviour against other males, indicating that their contests follow the pattern of scramble competition. The conditions characterizing parasitic reproduction apparently select for rapid responsiveness when opportunities arise to fertilize eggs, whereas attacking other males in this situation seems inappropriate. Our results show that males pursuing ARTs diverge in the way they react to reproductive competition, mainly dependent on their overall resource defence strategy.

AB I experimentally tested the repeatability and plasticity of two antipredator behaviours, shoaling and risk taking, in a sample of 443 juvenile three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. I quantified between-individual variation in these behaviours as well as behavioural changes over time in two groups of sticklebacks that were either exposed or not exposed to simulated predation pressure. Shoaling and risk taking were repeatable within individuals in both experimental and control fish. Individual willingness to shoal increased over time in both experimental and control groups, but there was no evidence that shoaling changed in response to predation risk. Risk taking also showed temporal changes: sticklebacks exposed to simulated predation risk became increasingly fearful, unlike the control fish, suggesting that this behaviour is plastic. There was, however, no evidence of between-individual variation in the behavioural changes over time in either the control or experimental condition, suggesting that behavioural plasticity is a fixed response in the individuals of this population.

AB Males that provide parental care may lose opportunities to acquire extrapair mates or secondary social mates. These opportunity costs can be estimated as the product of (1) the degree to which a male's participation in care makes him unready for mating (i.e. represents 'time-out' from the mating pool) and (2) the availability of potential mating partners. One stage of parenting may therefore be more costly than another because it depresses a male's probability of capitalizing on any given mating opportunity, and/or because it occurs when alternative mating opportunities are more abundant. To determine whether male parental care limits extrapair mating in house sparrows, Passer domesticus, we tracked changes in male extrapair mating success across stages of their nesting cycles. We then assessed whether periods of reduced extrapair mating by males coincided with a scarcity of fertilizable females, or whether certain activities placed males in time-out. We found that the number of potential extrapair mates was significantly higher on days when a male's social mate was fertile than during incubation or nestling provisioning; breeding synchrony consequently reduces the realized opportunity costs of male parenting. Nevertheless, males with nestlings to feed suffered greater opportunity costs than might be expected because of their relative inefficiency at obtaining extrapair matings with potentially available females. During the incubation stage, by contrast, the males' probability of extrapair mating per fertile female averaged four times higher. Thus, nestling provisioning apparently places males in a partial time-out, but male incubation does not. Males may be more fully engaged in the extrapair mating pool during incubation because they typically devote little time to this form of care and, when confronted with an increase in the abundance of extrapair mating prospects, they reduce the time they commit to incubation.

AB Precopulatory sexual cannibalism is an extreme form of sexual conflict because it has the potential to eliminate current and future reproductive success for males. Several female factors such as body condition, mating status and orientation are predicted to impact the likelihood of cannibalism, and males are expected to respond to these factors by altering their approach behaviours in ways that minimize the chance of being attacked (i.e. slower approach and greater distance at mounting). We used the sexually cannibalistic praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata to test whether and how certain female risk factors affect male approach and mating behaviour. We created three different risk treatments by manipulating female body condition, mating status and orientation, and recorded the frequency of cannibalism, male mating success, male approach behaviours and copulation duration. As predicted, female body condition and mating status had an effect on the frequency of sexual cannibalism, and cannibalized males had significantly lower mating success than noncannibalized males. Female orientation was the least important factor in determining the rate of sexual cannibalism in this system, with no significant difference between front-and rear-facing females. Contrary to what we predicted, male P. albofimbriata did not alter/shape their approach or mating behaviours relative to any of the proposed female risk factors of sexual cannibalism. There was also no difference in copulation duration between cannibalized and noncannibalized males. Future studies that investigate the effect of sexual cannibalism on postcopulatory male mating strategies will provide better clarification of the costs and benefits of sexual cannibalism in this system and will also be useful in understanding why males do not respond to the risk of sexual cannibalism in a precopulatory scenario.

AB Brood-parasitic offspring sexually (mis)imprinting on the foster parents is considered one of the greatest constraints to the evolution of interspecific avian brood parasitism. While most nonparasitic juvenile birds learn the behaviours and mate choice preferences from their own parents, social parasites must avoid misimprinting on their host species' phenotype in order to accurately recognize conspecifics. One possible mechanism to assure accurate species recognition by juvenile parasites is to begin to associate with adult parasitic conspecifics, known as the 'first contact' scenario, whereby adult female parasites facilitate the dispersal of their offspring away from hosts, thus providing accurate referents for conspecific recognition. Using an automated radiotelemetry system, we determined the presence or absence (every 1-2 min during three breeding seasons; 516 315 search occasions) of radiotagged parasitic adult female brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, and compared their departures from a forest study site with those of genetic offspring or experimentally transplanted (nonrelated) juvenile cowbirds within the female's egg-laying range. Contrary to our predictions, we found no support for the facilitation of juvenile cowbird dispersal by adult female cowbirds. Juvenile cowbirds typically were not located within their mother's home range when departing the forest and, likewise, departure events for natal and experimentally transplanted juveniles (<2%) did not overlap temporally with the departure of the genetically assigned mother or with the departure of other local radiotagged female cowbirds. Surprisingly, we found that juvenile cowbirds primarily departed from the host's territory at sunset, when adult female cowbirds are infrequently present within the forest. Our results suggest that the solitary nocturnal roosting behaviour of juvenile cowbirds may facilitate independence from their hosts, thus minimizing the risk of misimprinting on heterospecific phenotypes. This strategy may also indirectly promote conspecific interactions, providing further evidence for the importance of independent spatial and social preferences of hosts and brood parasites in the evolution of avian brood parasitism.

AB Hiding is a cooperative mother-infant behavioural strategy used by many ungulate species to mitigate infant predation risk. During the late stages of the hiding phase, infants begin a transition out of hiding and show behavioural changes that increase their exposure to predators. Mothers in many hider species are known to show potentially costly changes in habitat use, gregariousness and vigilance behaviour at the onset of the hiding phase. However, the effects of infant transitional behaviour on maternal behavioural patterns are understudied. In this study, we compare the behavioural patterns of Thomson's gazelle, Eudorcas thomsonii, females with young and transitioning fawns to determine the effect of fawn behavioural changes on maternal behaviour. We found that, although transitioning fawns were at greater risk than younger fawns while hidden, mothers of transitioning fawns were less vigilant than mothers of younger fawns during hiding periods. Mothers and fawns relied on group membership rather than heightened maternal vigilance to mitigate fawn risk during the transition. Group membership is apparently made possible by the shorter hiding bouts of transitioning fawns relative to younger fawns: more frequent activity bouts probably enable mothers to relocate their fawns more frequently, which helps the mother and fawn to keep up with group movements.

AB In animals that reproduce sexually, males are often under strong selection to maximize the number of mating opportunities. However, in some iteroparous species, males do not always maximize the allocation of time and energy to the present mating opportunity. Male hermit crabs of the genus Pagurus show precopulatory guarding as a mate acquisition strategy. Although almost all males within this genus guard and compete for receptive females, males of Pagurus filholi differ in how likely they are to do so. To examine the factors explaining the absence of guarding behaviour in P. filholi, a laboratory experiment was conducted that focused on whether either of two receptive females was guarded by solitary males that had been found not paired in the field, had lost a previous male-male contest or had copulated with other females. Solitary males showed a significantly lower frequency of guarding than males with experience of losing or of copulation. In the solitary group, males that moulted within 5 days after the experimental trial did not guard females, and the moulting frequency of nonguarding males was significantly higher than that of guarding males. In further analysis, smaller solitary males were shown to be less likely to guard females. The results of the experiment suggest that males of P. filholi may not always invest as much as possible in the present mating opportunity but may temporarily invest in growth during the 8-month mating season.

AB Theory predicts that the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) will be affected by any factor that alters the mating biology of its host. In insects, the presence of sex ratio-distorting symbionts may modulate population sex ratio, altering male and female encounter rates and creating the potential for symbionts to influence STI dynamics. We used laboratory experiments to investigate how a heritable male-killing Spiroplasma bacterial symbiont will affect the epidemiology of a sexually transmitted mite, Coccipolipus hippodamiae in the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata. We compared mating biology and STI transmission under 1: 1 and 4: 1 population sex ratios, equivalent to no male-killer presence and 75% male-killer prevalence. We observed that males have the potential to mate with enough females to maintain high female mating rate under strongly female-biased population sex ratios. Further, we observed that females remate more readily when males mate frequently, suggesting female mating rate may in fact be raised in female-biased populations. From the mite's perspective, these effects are countered, at least partly, by reductions in mite transmission from recently mated infected males. We modelled the impact of these processes on STI epidemiology, and concluded that strong sex ratio biases associated with male-killing bacteria are likely to speed the spread of STI infection through both male and female hosts. Thus, the presence of the male-killing bacterium is likely to have indirect impacts on female hosts, mediated through the STI. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social eavesdropping, or social evaluation of third-party interactions, is a first step to image scoring, which is a key feature of humans' large-scale cooperative society. Here we asked whether domestic dogs evaluate humans interacting with one another over neutral objects. In two experimental conditions, the dog's owner tried to open a container to get a junk object that was inside, then requested help from an actor sitting next to her/him, while the dog watched the interaction. In the Helper condition, the actor held the container stable to help the owner to open it. In the Nonhelper condition, the actor turned away and refused to help. In the Control condition, the actor simply turned away in the absence of any request for help. A neutral person sat at the other side of the owner throughout these interactions. After the interaction the actor and the neutral person each offered a piece of food to the dog. Dogs chose food randomly in the Helper and the Control conditions, but were biased against the actor in the Nonhelper condition. The dogs' avoidance of someone who behaved negatively to the owner suggests that social eavesdropping may be shared with a nonprimate species.

AB The paradigm of competitive males vying to influence female mate choice has been repeatedly upheld, but, increasingly, studies also report competitive females and choosy males. One female trait that is commonly proposed to influence male mate choice is the exaggerated sexual swelling displayed by females of many Old World primate species. The reliable indicator hypothesis posits that females use the exaggerated swellings to compete for access to mates, and that the swellings advertise variation in female fitness. We tested the two main predictions of this hypothesis in a wild population of baboons (Papio cynocephalus). First, we examined the effect of swelling size on the probability of mate guarding ('consortship') by the highest-ranking male and the behaviour of those males that trailed consortships ('follower males'). Second, we asked whether a female's swelling size predicted several fitness measures. We found that high-ranking males did not prefer females with larger swellings (when controlling for cycle number and conception) and that females with larger swellings did not have higher reproductive success. Our study, the only complete test of the reliable indicator hypothesis in a primate population, rejects the idea that female baboons compete for mates by advertising heritable fitness differences. Furthermore, we found unambiguous evidence that males biased their mating decisions in favour of females who had experienced more sexual cycles since their most recent pregnancy. Thus, rather than tracking the potential differences in fitness between females, male baboons appear to track and target the potential for a given reproductive opportunity to result in fertilization.

AB Organisms face the challenge of optimally allocating limited resources among investments that promote survival, growth or reproduction. In species whose members build complex nests, this resource allocation problem also applies to the building and use of the nest structure, a critical part of an individual's extended phenotype. Honeybee colonies face an acute problem of properly allocating one nest resource in particular, large cells of drone comb built for rearing drones, between reproduction (rearing drones) and survival (storing honey). Here the trade-off is inescapable, because a drone cell cannot be used simultaneously for drone production and honey storage. We predicted that the workers in a honeybee colony would solve this problem by preferentially using drone comb for producing drones when their mating opportunities are good (spring and early summer) and for honey storage when the drones' mating opportunities are poor (late summer and autumn). To test our prediction, we experimentally tested how drone comb and worker comb were used for honey storage from April to September. In spring and early summer, workers preferentially removed honey from drone comb, making it available for producing drones. In late summer and autumn, workers did not preferentially remove honey from drone comb. This study shows that a honeybee colony is able to fine-tune its extended phenotype by adaptively allocating a key nest resource, its drone comb, between survival and reproduction.

AB Male songbirds use song to advertise their attractiveness as potential mates, and the properties of those songs have a powerful influence on female mate preferences. One idea is that males may exert themselves maximally in each song performance, consistent with female evaluation and formation of mate preferences being the primary contributors to mate choice. Alternatively, males may modulate their song behaviour to different degrees in the presence of different females, consistent with both male and female mate preferences contributing to mutual mate choice. Here we consider whether male Bengalese finches, Lonchura striata domestica, express mate preferences at the level of individual females, and whether those preferences are manifest as changes in song behaviour that are sufficient to influence female mate choice. We tested this idea by recording songs performed by individual unmated males during a series of 1 h interactions with each of many unmated females. Across recording sessions, males systematically varied both the quantity and the quality of the songs that they performed to different females. Males also varied their song properties throughout the course of each interaction, and behavioural tests using female birds revealed that songs performed at the onset of each interaction were significantly more attractive than songs performed by the same male later during the same interaction. This demonstration of context-specific variation in the properties of male reproductive signals and a role for that variation in shaping female mate preference reveals that male mate preferences play an important role in mutual mate choice in this species. Because these birds thrive so well in the laboratory and are so amenable to observation and experimentation across generations, these results yield a new model system that may prove especially advantageous in disentangling the role of male and female mate preferences in shaping mutual mate choice and its long-term benefits or consequences.

AB Food-hoarding patterns range between larder hoarding (a few large caches) and scatter hoarding (many small caches), and are, in essence, the outcome of a hoard size-number trade-off in pilferage risk. Animals that scatter hoard are believed to do so, despite higher costs, to reduce loss of cached food to competitors against which they cannot defend their food reserves (henceforth: superior competitors). We tested the underlying assumption that the cost of having more caches under scatter hoarding, thus increasing the likelihood of cache encounter by superior competitors, is outweighed by the benefit of having small caches that are less likely to be detected upon encounter by superior competitors. We carried out a controlled experiment in which we distributed a fixed number of acorns over a fixed number of patches within a fixed area, varying cache size and cache depth, thus mimicking alternative hoarding patterns. We then recorded cache pilferage by a fixed number of wild boar, a well-known pilferer of acorn caches. The time wild boar needed to pilfer the first cache was shortest for scatter hoarding, but the time needed to pilfer all caches was slightly longer for scatter hoarding than for larder hoarding. Overall, however, the rate of pilferage did not differ between scatter hoarding and larder hoarding, and was not affected by cache depth. We conclude that the effects of alternative hoarding patterns on reducing cache pilferage by wild boar were smaller than expected, and that superior competitors may thus not be important drivers of scatter hoarding. Instead, other factors, such as conspecific pilferage or the risk of cross-contamination of food items in large caches, which can also cause catastrophic loss of food reserves, may be more important drivers of scatter hoarding.

AB Survival depends on escape responses and when to flee a predator. As a result, factors affecting the escape performance of prey species, including parasite infection, may profoundly influence the outcome of predator-prey encounters. Several hypotheses predict the responses of prey to simulated predator attacks based on intrinsic characteristics such as individual reproductive value and flight costs: as predation risk and reproductive value increase, so should the distance at which an organism begins to flee an escaping predator (flight initiation distance; FID). Conversely, FID should decrease if the costs of fleeing are high. Despite providing testable hypotheses, rarely have these theories been used to predict the escape behaviour of parasitized individuals. The bridled monocle bream, Scolopsis bilineata, is parasitized by a large cymothoid isopod, Anilocra nemipteri, which attaches above the eye. In this species, ectoparasite infection is associated with increased energy costs and decreased endurance. We investigated the effects of infection on escape performance and FID. Maximum velocity, maximum acceleration, cumulative distance travelled and response latency did not differ between parasitized fish, unparasitized fish and fish that had their parasite experimentally removed. Parasitized fish were smaller, on average, than unparasitized individuals. Smaller, parasitized individuals allowed a threat to approach closer before fleeing (shorter FID) than larger parasitized or uninfected individuals. Since parasite infection has known effects on host growth and metabolism, we suggest that parasitism alters fish escape behaviour as predicted by two nonexclusive hypotheses: (1) by decreasing reproductive value (the asset protection hypothesis) and (2) by increasing the relative costs of fleeing (the economic hypothesis) compared with uninfected and large parasitized fish. The relative importance of each hypothesis in driving the trends observed remains to be tested. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Repeated interactions between individuals in socially living animals select for the evolution of signals that convey information identifying individuals or categories of individuals, which may enable the discrimination of familiar versus unfamiliar individuals. Such information may help animals maximize their inclusive fitness by adjusting their own behaviour, allowing them to avoid conflict, preferentially direct help and/or ignore unreliable individuals. Acoustic signals in birds provide the potential to encode individual-specific information. We examined the degree to which individual identity, sex, breeding status, group membership and genetic relatedness were related to variability in six different call types, which occurred across a variety of different behavioural contexts in the apostlebird, Struthidea cinerea, a socially living and cooperatively breeding Australian passerine. We demonstrated that not all calls reflected the same extent of information. Of the six call types, call variation was related to individual identity in three call types, breeding status in two call types and sex and group relatedness in one call type. Finally, variation in two call types was not related to any of the measured variables. Our results suggest that some, but not all, acoustic signals in apostlebirds may be selected for individual distinctiveness between individuals and categories of individuals (male versus female, breeder versus nonbreeder), and these signals may be important in determining levels of cooperation and interaction between individuals in this cooperatively breeding society.

AB Under certain models of animal competition, individuals are expected to gather information about opponent quality in order to determine whether they should fight or withdraw. However, the ability to process complex information differs between individuals and across brain hemispheres: a feature of vertebrate cognition known as lateralization that is not anticipated by contest models. I investigated the relationship between aggressive behaviour and mating success during the fallow deer, Dama dama, rut and a measure of lateralization derived from eye preference during parallel walking. Results show that there was no relationship between the tendency to escalate to fighting or predictability in the tendency to engage in fighting and lateralization. Conversely, there was a quadratic relationship between third-party intervention behaviour and lateralization: the greater the tendency to intervene in ongoing fights the lower the degree of lateralization. However, individuals that showed lateralization for right-eye use were least likely to be targeted by the intervening male; thus lateralization is beneficial in this context because targeted males are highly likely to lose this subsequent encounter. The relationship between lateralization and mating success was also nonlinear: males that showed little evidence for an eye bias during lateral displays had the greatest mating success. Taken together, individuals that showed lateralization benefited from avoiding being targeted after third-party intervention; conversely, individuals that showed little evidence for lateralization actively intervened during ongoing fights and had higher mating success. These results suggest that, although lateralization does appear to confer a fitness advantage on individuals, this is not as extensive as anticipated.

AB Contest competition is the direct struggle for mates, resources, or both. Winning contests is thought to be determined by a competitor's fighting ability (resource-holding potential, RHP), the value of a contested resource to a competitor (resource value, RV), or both. Larger competitors' winning against smaller competitors is often explained by larger competitors having greater RHP. Older competitors' winning against younger competitors is often explained by older competitors valuing resources more highly (RV). In this study, we explored whether RHP explained the size effects and whether RV explained the age effects hypothesized to occur in pairwise male-male contests in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. We found that larger males won contests against smaller males, but that the sizes of winning and losing competitors did not predict the degree of agonism. When we attempted to manipulate RHP through feeding, we found that feeding increased the probability of contest success among old males, but not among young males, and did not affect agonism, regardless of the competitors' ages. We conclude that larger males win as a result of their greater RHPs. Old males were more likely to win contests against young males and were more agonistic than young males in age-matched contests. When we attempted to manipulate RV through mating experience, we found that previously mated males did not differ from unmated males in the probability of contest success. However, competing pairs that included at least one mated male were more agonistic than all-virgin pairs. We conclude that it remains unclear whether RV adequately explains why old males win contests against young males, and that further investigation is warranted.

AB Many animals show behavioural syndromes (i.e. suites of correlated behaviours across multiple situations). These behavioural correlations, however, imply limitations in the behavioural plasticity of individuals when facing the trade-off between predation risk and starvation risk. Some models suggest that proactive animals prioritize the reduction of starvation risk, while reactive animals do the opposite. Therefore, fast explorers that are also bold (i.e. proactive) are assumed to pay a predation cost associated with their behavioural trait. However, it has recently been suggested that proactive individuals may be able to compensate for their higher risk of predation by adopting some antipredator behaviours. In this study we tested these two alternative hypotheses with wild wintering Eurasian siskins, Carduelis spinus, foraging at artificial feeders. Male siskins have a melanin-based black bib that has been found to be correlated with exploratory behaviour, aggressiveness and dominance, and therefore is a signal of pro-activity. We found that male siskins with large black bibs uttered more distress calls upon capture and displayed a vigilance strategy that improved predator detection. Moreover, this vigilance strategy did not reduce food intake rate. These results show that proactive individuals are not reckless, but instead compensate for their personality trait with stronger antipredator behaviours, and thus, do not necessarily have to pay a predation cost. Our results support the view of a positive relationship between eumelanism, proactive personality and the display of antipredator behaviours.

AB Chromatic signals result from the differential absorption of light by chemical compounds (pigment-based colours) and/or from differential scattering of light by integument nanostructures (structural colours). Both structural and pigment-based colours can be costly to produce, maintain and display, and have been shown to convey information about a variety of individual quality traits. Male wall lizards, Podarcis muralis, display conspicuously coloured ventral and lateral patches during ritualized inter-and intra-sexual displays: ventral colours (perceived as orange, yellow or white by humans) are pigment based, while the ultraviolet (UV)-blue of the outer ventral scales (OVS), located along the flanks, is structurally produced. We used spectrophotometric data from 372 adult males to examine, considering the entire visual spectrum of lizards, whether ventral and OVS colour variables can predict male quality. Results indicate that the hue and UV chroma of OVS are good predictors of fighting ability (size-independent bite force) and body condition, respectively. This suggests that structural colour patches are condition dependent and function as complex multicomponent signals in this species. In contrast, ventral coloration apparently does not function as a male quality indicator. We suggest that ventral and lateral colour patches may be social signals with different information content, possibly aimed at different receivers.

AB Foraging on spatiotemporally unpredictable food sources is widespread among animals. Locating unpredictable food is, however, expected to pose specific challenges to an animal's foraging strategy. Primarily exploiting wild-growing mushrooms, the ant Euprenolepis procera represents a remarkable example of an animal that relies on ephemeral resources. In the present study we investigated how the ant's foraging system has adapted to this challenging diet. We tested feeding preferences of E. procera, monitored spatiotemporal growth patterns of mushrooms and analysed the ant's foraging trail system. The growth patterns of mushrooms turned out to be more predictable than commonly believed, since they reappeared frequently (up to 15 times in 1 month) in close vicinity of former growth locations. Generally, such spatially fixed and periodically regrowing resources can be utilized effectively by revisiting them. While many animals rely on idiosyncratic spatial memory to accomplish this task, we found that E. procera established a wide-ranging, stable trail network that served as an external colony memory. Subsections of the trail network were used only periodically. Inactive trail sections persisted and served as the external colony memory allowing the ants to check growing sites periodically and eventually harvest regrowing mushrooms collectively. We conclude that this unusual foraging behaviour, which features permanence (route fidelity over time) as well as flexibility (activation/deactivation of trail sections), is well adapted to the growth pattern of mushrooms, underlining the high potential of collective behaviour for an efficient exploitation of ephemeral food sources.

AB Recent studies have emphasized that the choosiness of mate-seeking individuals may differ greatly in response to the size and age of both participants. As haplodiploids, parasitoid wasps provide unusual opportunities for studies of mating preferences, since females can produce male offspring without mating, thus changing the consequences of not mating from the standard diploid model. Few studies of wasp mating systems have examined mating patterns in the field, even though the limited dimensions of laboratory cages may prevent normal search patterns or dispersal ranges and thereby potentially alter mating patterns. We thus investigated several size-and age-related variables that may influence the mate choice behaviour of male and female solitary parasitoid wasps Alabagrus texanus (Cresson) (Braconidae) under both field and confined laboratory conditions. In the field, similar numbers of tethered virgin females (1) mated with the first male visitor, (2) rejected the first but then mated with a subsequent male and (3) did not mate at all. Heavy females mated more often than light ones, but male mating success did not significantly differ with male or female mass. Early-arriving males of intermediate mass (and age) obtained the most matings, but the youngest (1-day-old) and oldest males were all unsuccessful. Age-related variance of females did not play a significant role, since they mated immediately after emergence. However, under highly constrained spatial conditions in the laboratory, several of the previously field-resistant females mated despite the limited number of males present, demonstrating the importance of space in the Alabagrus mating system.

AB Revealing the evolutionary origin of novel traits is a long-standing challenge in evolutionary biology. The dynamics of antipredator signalling and conspecific advertisement provide one framework in which to investigate this phenomenon, because shifts in signal context may lead to new signal functions, novel evolutionary pressures and ultimately novel phenotypes. Several species of fairy-wrens (Maluridae: Malurus) give song-like trills ('Type II song') in response to vocalizations of avian predators. Despite this predator context, in some species the trills appear to function as conspecific-directed displays. We investigated two hypotheses for the evolutionary origin of predator-elicited Type II songs: (1) they originated as antipredator signals, then shifted to a display context and subsequently became more elaborate because selection pressures changed; or alternatively (2) they originated as conspecific-directed songs, then shifted to a predator context to exploit an effective communication window. Using predator playbacks and samples of natural dawn chorus recordings, we found that many Malurus species gave trills in response to predators, but only a subset gave unprompted trills during dawn chorus displays, and ancestral state reconstructions suggested that the predator-elicited context evolved first. Additionally, species that used trills more often (in both predator and unsolicited contexts) tended to have longer trills with a faster note rate, suggesting that trills have evolved a higher performance as they became a more important part of the display repertoire. Our results support the hypothesis that trill displays originated through the elaboration of predator context calls and provide an example of a shift in signal context leading to novel signal phenotypes.

AB Most birds are socially monogamous, diurnally active and have small home ranges. These birds occasionally undertake extraterritorial forays, presumably to seek extrapair copulations. We used automated radiotelemetry to examine nocturnal forays and activity of a diurnal, socially monogamous passerine, the yellow-breasted chat, Icterina virens. Males and females forayed during both day and night, but night forays were more common. In addition to varying between day and night, there were sex-and breeding-stage-specific differences in foraying behaviour. Males forayed more than females and more frequently when their female was not fertile. Conversely, females primarily forayed when fertile. We suggest that females foray at night to avoid detection, because their mate's knowledge of potential extrapair copulations may result in harassment or decreased parental care. Both sexes were nocturnally active; however, the activity of males peaked when their mates were fertile, probably to prevent their mates from foraying and guarding them from foraying males. The nocturnal behaviour of chats suggest that extraterritorial forays may be more common than previously thought and that nocturnal behaviours may be crucial for understanding the strategies males and females use to acquire extrapair copulations.

AB Owing to the trade-off between time for searching for and exploiting resources, choosing a profitable food resource is key for an animal's survival and reproductive success. Although the optimal diet model (ODM) from optimal foraging theory (OFT) has demonstrated this point successfully by modelling the global maximization of energy intake rate for foraging, the behavioural mechanisms by which animals achieve optimization, especially when facing a novel environment, have yet to be understood. Here we propose a recent experience-driven (RED) decision-making rule of foraging that relies only on short-term memory of recent feeding experience and hunger aversion. This contrasts with the ODM, which assumes both global information access to the forager and its apparent ability to reach optimal choices. Despite relying only on limited past experience and hunger aversion, this behavioural rule not only accounts for nearly the same energy intake rate as predicted by the ODM but also can flexibly respond to changing environments by rapidly reaching new optimization. The RED behaviour also predicts a more realistic partial preference for diet choice, contrasting with the zero-one rule of OFT which allows for no partial preference within the forager's diet. The partial preference simply emerges from the RED strategy, as opposed to decision-making errors imposed from behavioural and physiological constraints. The RED rule further elucidates three potential traits that natural selection can act upon for optimizing foraging: (1) short-term memory of recent feeding experience, (2) ability to recognize encountered resources, and (3) basic neural set-up for alternative responses to environmental cues. This simple and flexible RED rule thus provides a behavioural mechanism for optimal foraging, and can be further applied to decision-making theory in psychology and economics.

AB In species in which males display collectively, females may evaluate display features that arise specifically in groups in addition to basic features of signal energy. For example, in acoustic insects and anurans that chorus, males often adjust their song timing relative to neighbours, and females may pay attention to these adjustments in timing. Many laboratory studies show how males may delay the phase of their song rhythm with respect to a song stimulus such that they call just prior to the stimulus; similarly, females may choose a male whose song rhythm leads a neighbour by a brief interval. However, the importance of male phase adjustments and female attention to call order in actual choruses has remained poorly understood. We studied female choice in laboratory choruses in the bushcricket Ephippiger diurnus, a species with preferences for leading calls but also for longer calls and faster rhythms, features representing broadcast energy. Although chorusing males varied in all features, we found that females largely focused on call order. This overriding preference for call order may be reflected by the prevalence of male phase adjustment throughout the population, a feature that would have been subject to strong sexual selection. We found that the broadcast of leading calls within a chorus was not repeatable among males but rather shifted among the chorus participants. This observation too may reflect the strong selection imposed by female choice for call order, and it may have implications for the role of receiver psychology in the evolution of mate choice.

ID BENEFITS; BEHAVIOR; PRIMATES
AB Previous analyses indicate that female baboons that form strong and stable social bonds reproduce more successfully than others, and that some elements of females' personalities are associated with the tendency to form close social bonds. Here we use a new method to confirm that females' personalities were stable over time, although not fixed, and that matrilineal kin had personalities that were no more alike than those of other individuals. Our results indicate that personality similarities enhance the strength of social bonds among some pairs of females but not others. Strong bonds between matrilineal sisters were correlated with similarity in their personalities and ages, but mothers and daughters formed uniformly strong bonds regardless of the similarities in their personalities or ages. Among nonkin, strong bonds were correlated with similarity in age and dominance rank, but not personality. Females adjusted the behaviours that contributed to their personality scores in response to unpredictable demographic events, like the death of a close relative. Results suggest that the personality traits of female baboons do not exist in isolation but are embedded in a network of rank and kin relations. Although a female baboon has little control over her dominance rank or the presence of kin, by varying the tenor of her social interactions she can take advantage of the opportunities, or overcome the constraints, imposed by demographic circumstances. For this reason, selection may have favoured particular personality traits that are relatively independent of rank and the presence of kin. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In mammals, lactation is the most energetically demanding component of female reproduction. Theory predicts an increase in food intake by lactating females, but very few studies have used contraceptives to experimentally test the influence of reproduction on foraging behaviour of wild mammals. From 2009 to 2011, we observed 182 individually marked female eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, in two populations, including 29 that received an experimental contraceptive treatment. We sought to determine whether lactating females increase their foraging rate compared to contracepted and naturally nonlactating females. The proportion of time spent foraging during 10 min focal samples did not vary according to reproductive status in one population. In the other, lactating females spent 4% less time feeding than nonlactating females. Day and midday activity and bite and chewing rates were higher in lactating than in nonlactating females. Bite rate increased with the size of the pouch young and was higher for mothers of sons than for mothers of daughters. Bite rate was also affected by reproductive effort in the previous year, being higher for females that had weaned a young. Foraging behaviour was independent of body mass and group size, but bite rate appeared to decrease with female age. In one population, we found strong effects of date and year on foraging behaviour. Our study is a rare experimental manipulation of reproduction in free-ranging large mammals. We found that foraging behaviours were affected by both previous and current reproductive effort and varied with individual characteristics and environmental conditions.

AB If primates were capable of vocalizing to inform a receiver about an external entity, it would represent an important element of continuity with human language. We tested experimentally whether chimpanzee rough grunts, which function to refer to food, are produced selectively, indicating voluntary control, and whether they are directed at specific individuals. These are prerequisites for a system capable of actively informing others about external events. We conducted a field playback experiment in which we presented silently feeding male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, with arrival pant hoots of a familiar group member. We found that subjects were significantly more likely to respond with food calls to the simulated arrival of an individual with whom the caller had a high rather than low level of friendship and where there was a large rather than small positive dominance rank difference between the individuals (i.e. caller was lower ranking). We concluded that chimpanzee food calls are not simply reflexive responses to food, but can be selectively directed at socially important individuals. Our findings are thus inconsistent with traditional views of primate vocalizations as inflexibly and indiscriminately produced. Instead, our results indicate that great apes can produce semantically meaningful calls in a highly selective, recipient-directed manner. Further research is needed to test whether chimpanzees use this flexible system to inform ignorant individuals about food, but the prerequisites to support this type of communication seem to be present.

AB In many bird species offspring hatch over hours or days, which leads to an age and size hierarchy within broods. The function of hatching asynchrony is much debated, and it has been suggested that the induced size hierarchy among offspring may be an adaptive maternal mechanism for maximizing reproductive output under variable environmental conditions. The best known hypothesis to explain the adaptive value of hatching asynchrony, the 'brood reduction' hypothesis, holds that a size hierarchy among offspring allows for a quick adaptive adjustment of brood size to unpredictable feeding conditions and thus benefits parents. To test the consequences of hatching asynchrony on offspring growth and food provisioning we experimentally manipulated the onset of incubation of eggs within broods of great tits, Parus major, to induce either synchronous or asynchronous hatching, and then manipulated brood size after hatching to simulate favourable, control or harsh conditions. We did not find a difference in offspring mortality between asynchronous and synchronous broods under any of these conditions. In harsh conditions, nestling mass and size were reduced in asynchronous broods compared to synchronous ones. The opposite pattern occurred under control conditions. Although our results showed that induced hatching asynchrony alters offspring phenotype, they do not provide strong support for the brood reduction hypothesis as a mechanism to explain hatching asynchrony.

AB Intragenotypic variability (IGV) occurs when individuals with the same genotype, reared in the same environment and then tested under the same conditions, express different trait values. Game theoretical and bet-hedging models have suggested two ways that a single genotype might generate variable behaviour when behavioural variation is discrete rather than continuous: behavioural polyphenism (a genotype produces different types of individuals, each of which consistently expresses a different type of behaviour) or stochastic variability (a genotype produces one type of individual that randomly expresses different types of behaviour over time). We first demonstrated significant differences across 14 natural genotypes of male Drosophila melanogaster in the variability (as measured by entropy) of their microhabitat choice in an experiment in which each fly was allowed free access to four different types of habitat. We then tested four hypotheses about ways that within-individual variability might contribute to differences across genotypes in the variability of microhabitat choice. There was no empirical support for three hypotheses (behavioural polymorphism, consistent choice, or time-based choice), nor could our results be attributed to genotypic differences in activity levels. The stochastic variability hypothesis accurately predicted the slope and the intercept of the relationship across genotypes between entropy at the individual level and entropy at the genotype level. However, our initial version of the stochastic model slightly but significantly overestimated the values of individual entropy for each genotype, pointing to specific assumptions of this model that might need to be adjusted in future studies of the IGV of microhabitat choice. This is among a handful of recent studies to document genotypic differences in behavioural IGV, and the first to explore ways that genotypic differences in within-individual variability might contribute to differences among genotypes in the predictability of their behaviour.

AB Control operations for invasive ship rats, Rattus rattus, in New Zealand forests are often followed by increased house mouse, Mus musculus, detections suggesting rats suppress mice. A potential mechanism is intraguild predation, either by interference competition or as simple predatory behaviour. If aggression by rats towards mice is mainly competitive, it should include threat and display features associated with, for example, intraspecific fighting. If predatory, it should lack these features and be associated with feeding. In the first of two captive experiments we observed interactions between paired, live rodents, either side of a wire-mesh screen, and found that most rats were aggressive to mice. This aggression lacked threat and display characteristics typical of encounters with conspecifics and was rarely reciprocated by mice. In a second experiment, euthanized mice were drawn by a line through cages occupied by rats fed either a restricted or unrestricted diet. Rats of both groups attacked and restrained the euthanized mice, and all rats that interacted with the mice ate at least part of them, although food-restricted rats tended to eat more. As the aggressive response of ship rats towards mice lacked threat and display features and was related to feeding, we conclude that it resembles predatory behaviour. Our findings provide a better understanding of the interactions between ship rats and house mice, which hinder their management where they coexist as damaging invaders. However, further research is required to determine whether the results of our captive experiments are consistent with wild rat behaviour. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Understanding how colony-level behaviour is determined is of evolutionary significance because colony-level traits can influence individual fitness and group success. Here we explore how the composition of individual behavioural types within colonies influences colony-level behaviour in the social spider Stegodyphus sarasinorum. First, we tested whether S. sarasinorum show stable individual differences in behaviour (i.e. individual personalities) and whether aspects of individuals' behaviour are correlated across contexts, in the form of a behavioural syndrome. As documented in many other animals, S. sarasinorum showed stable individual differences in behaviour that were repeatable across time, and correlated across contexts (i.e. aggressiveness, boldness). Second, we tested for and confirmed the presence of consistent intercolony variation (i.e. colony-level personalities) in collective foraging behaviour. Third, we generated artificially reconstituted colonies of known group size and personality composition to test for associations between colonies' personality composition and their collective foraging behaviour. In experimental colonies, we found that the average phenotypes of colony constituents were associated with colony-level behaviour, where colonies composed of smaller and bolder spiders were more responsive during foraging. However, the single best predictor of colony-level behaviour was the behavioural type of the single most extreme individual, where the boldness score of boldest individuals explained 66-69% of the variation in colony-level behaviour. Together, our results suggest that variation in the personality composition of social groups may be an important driver of variation in colony-level personality.

AB In a meta-analysis, we analysed GPS-recorded tracks of homing pigeons, focusing on how initial behaviour and track structure change with increasing distance from the loft and on the effect of local experience. 'Points of Decision' divide the tracks into several phases, with the first marking the end of the initial phase, when the pigeon begins to leave the release site. With increasing distance, the number of Points of Decision increases significantly, whether pigeons are unfamiliar or familiar with the release site. In unfamiliar birds, the duration of the initial phase increases with increasing distance from the home loft, while agreement among birds decreases. These correlations with distance, not found in familiar birds, appear to reflect the necessity to interpret the still unfamiliar combination of 'map' factors. Pigeons starting a second time from a site take more time to leave and initially fly over a larger area, which we interpret as a procedure to integrate the respective site into their 'map'. When pigeons are released repeatedly from the same sites, the behaviour at the beginning of the flight does not change consistently, but there are fewer decision points and overall efficiency increases. The flight routes chosen by individuals continue to differ; route stereotypies, as described in the Oxford region, are not observed. This suggests loft-specific difference in the weighting and rating of navigational factors, probably caused by the availability and suitability of these factors in the respective regions. Our findings warn against simply transferring findings from one loft to another. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Natal dispersal (i.e. movements between the natal range of an individual and its first breeding site) is a complex process which can have profound impacts on population dynamics. In most species, only a proportion of juveniles actually disperse, but few empirical data are available on the factors that drive the decision to disperse. To understand the behavioural ontogeny of the decision to disperse, we investigated the ranging behaviour of 66 juvenile roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, monitored with GPS collars prior to and during the dispersal phase. We compared the number and features (distance and duration) of exploratory movements during the period prior to dispersal between philopatric individuals and dispersers. Overall, 76% of the juveniles that dispersed during their first spring performed exploratory movements prior to the dispersal period. Indeed, exploration prior to the dispersal phase was much more common among future dispersers than among future philopatric individuals, suggesting that dispersal of juveniles is facilitated to some degree by predispersal exploration forays. Furthermore, the direction of the dispersal event was correlated with the direction of previous exploration, although there was no relationship between exploration distance and subsequent dispersal distance. Thus, it appears that individuals that subsequently disperse first explore their environment, prior to definitively leaving their natal range, probably to obtain information on potential suitable adult ranges. Exploratory movements prior to dispersal can thus provide information that influences an individual's decision on whether or not to disperse and, if so, in which direction.

AB Females vary in their mate choice and consequent fitness outcomes. Individual differences may be explained by conditions experienced early in life. We tested whether the sex ratio at which young pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, were reared affected their adult sexual behaviour. Females reared in equal sex ratios discriminated strongly between males of differing attractiveness in choice tests and had the lowest variance in mating success. Conversely, females reared in female-biased sex ratios showed little discrimination between males based on their attractiveness, and exhibited highly skewed mating success with the majority gaining no copulations, but a quarter each gaining more copulations than any other female in the study. Early life environmental determination of variation in female choice could explain the lack of uniformity in mate choice and hence maintain variation in male traits in the face of directional sexual selection.

AB The developmental stress hypothesis proposes that the honesty of birdsong is maintained by costs incurred during development, such that song in adulthood reflects exposure to early-life stressors. We determined the effects of early-life (7-60 days of age) food restriction or corticosterone (CORT) treatment on adult song production and neuroanatomy in male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia. When males were adults, we quantified song type repertoire size, syllable repertoire size, song-learning accuracy, trill deviation (the speed of frequency modulation in a trill) and song type stereotypy. We also analysed the volumes of the song control nuclei HVC, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), area X and the number of neurons in HVC. Song type and syllable repertoire sizes of food-restricted and CORT-treated birds were smaller than those of controls. Food restriction, but not CORT treatment, also reduced song-learning accuracy. We observed no effects of either treatment on trill deviation or song type stereotypy. However, trill deviation was significantly related to paternal repertoire size, suggesting a heritable component to some aspects of vocal learning. The volume of RA was smaller in food-restricted birds than in control or CORT-treated birds. Neither treatment affected the volumes of HVC or area X, or the number of neurons in HVC. Our results suggest that song complexity and song-learning accuracy may be honest indicators of a male song sparrow's early ontogeny and that early-life stress has long-lasting effects on the song control system in this species. However, measures of vocal performance (trill deviation, song type stereotypy) do not appear to be significantly affected by early-life stress in song sparrows.

AB Parasitoid foraging decisions are often affected by community characteristics such as community diversity and complexity. As part of a complex habitat, the presence of unsuitable hosts may affect foraging behaviour of parasitoids. First, unsuitable herbivores may affect the localization of patches where hosts are present. Second, encounters with unsuitable herbivores in the food plant patch may affect parasitoid decisions during their searching behaviour in the patch. In this review, we outline the importance of the presence of unsuitable herbivores on the behavioural responses of parasitoids during both these foraging phases. Nonhosts feeding on a neighbouring plant or on the same plant individual the host is feeding from may affect odour-based searching by parasitoids in a way specific for the species combination studied. Feeding by specific host and nonhost-herbivore combinations may induce volatiles that are more, less or equally attractive compared to those from plants infested by the host only. Within the food patch, mixed presence of host and nonhost may reduce the number of hosts parasitized per time unit and reduce parasitoid foraging efficiency. Importantly, we show that a single nonhost species may have contrasting effects in terms of its effects on odour-based searching and patch residence decisions. We conclude that studying host searching behaviour at both phases of foraging is essential for our understanding of parasitoid foraging behaviour in natural and agricultural settings. We further speculate on the ecological context in which unsuitable herbivores affect either of the two phases of parasitoid foraging. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In their 1960 paper about bats using echolocation to find and track flying insects, Donald R. Griffin, Fredric A. Webster and Charles R. Michael (Animal Behaviour, 8, 141-154) changed the face of research on this behaviour. They moved the field of echolocation from documenting that this animal or that one could echolocate to demonstrating an adaptive value of echolocation. They used experiments with captive bats, fruit flies, mosquitoes and crane flies to illustrate how bats used a 'feeding buzz' as they closed with their prey. The topic remains current today, and one of the first papers in Nature in 2013 (Jacobsen et al., 493, 93-96) presented more information about feeding buzzes building on the platform that Griffin et al. had established. In the intervening period, literally thousands of papers have been published about echolocation, demonstrating how curious minds, technological advances and basic information about natural history can result in diversification of a field of research. We have learned that bats can use echolocation to recognize water surfaces and to find insect prey on spider webs. The continuum between orientation and social functions of echolocation means that this behaviour not only influences foraging and negotiating obstacle paths, but is also a cue that brings individuals together. Acoustic wars between bats and potential insect prey have further enriched the discipline by identifying acoustic measures and countermeasures used by the players. Parallel studies with toothed whales have provided further examples of the enrichment that echolocation brings to the lives of animals and those who study them.

AB Many behaviours vary in response to the environment (biotic or abiotic) and therefore represent an interesting form of phenotypic plasticity. Behavioural plasticity, like other plastic traits, can evolve through genetic assimilation or accommodation. However, little is known about the nature of changes in gene expression plasticity that accompanies these evolutionary changes in phenotypic plasticity. We know that variation in gene expression level, a first-order phenotype, underlies much behavioural variation. Several studies have begun to document which genes show expression-level variation related to plastic changes in behaviour as well as evolved changes in behaviour. Advances in sequencing technology allow us to address these questions on a genomic scale. By characterizing changes in gene expression according to the concept of a norm of reaction one can describe the evolved patterns of gene expression that accompany the evolution of behavioural plasticity. Here, we describe how genomic approaches can help us understand changes in gene expression that accompany or underlie the evolution of behavioural plasticity. To do this, we provide a framework of classification for the evolved patterns of gene expression plasticity that could underlie genetic assimilation or accommodation of behaviour. We provide examples of genetic assimilation from the animal behaviour and animal physiology literature that have been, or can be, studied at a genomic level. We then describe the characteristics of an appropriate study system and briefly address experimental design using the available genomic tools in a comparative context. Studying the patterns of gene expression associated with genetic assimilation will elucidate processes by which behavioural plasticity has evolved.

AB Colour and pattern provide important visual cues that affect animal behaviour. Learned avoidance of unpalatable prey by coral reef fish in response to visual cues has been studied before, but visual cues have not been separated from distastefulness to make certain that fish were learning solely in response to visual signals. Here, we used artificial foods to test the ability of wild-caught bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, a common Caribbean reef fish, to learn to avoid unpalatable prey in laboratory experiments. First, we tested whether the relative position of foods of the same or different colours affected avoidance of unpalatable prey. Next, we tested whether blueheads could learn to avoid different colours of unpalatable prey. These experiments also tested whether blueheads could learn to avoid unpalatable prey against a pre-experimental colour bias. Finally, we determined whether blueheads learn to avoid unpalatable prey more effectively using colour or pattern signals. Fish learned to avoid unpalatable prey using colour independent of prey position, and they learned to avoid some colours (red, blue and orange), but not others (yellow, purple and green), based on visual cues alone. Fish avoided yellow, purple and green coloured prey, regardless of whether they were palatable or unpalatable. Fish only avoided white prey when unpalatable. Fish rapidly learned to overcome a strong pre-experimental bias against red prey. There was no difference in the ability of fish to learn to avoid prey using colour or pattern. We conclude that blueheads learn to avoid unpalatable prey using visual signals alone, that they have different responses to different colours and that they adapt quickly to novel prey appearance. Our results do not support the concept that specific prey colours, such as red or orange, strictly signal a chemical defence, but that blueheads continually assess and adapt to prey palatability using visual cues.

AB Many species in social groups make use of readily available, socially provided information for behaviours including predator avoidance, mate choice and foraging. Not only are actions imitated, but they may also be reapplied in variable future situations, suggesting an explicit knowledge of the purpose of the behaviours. Social learning thus enables animals to learn about their complex environments rapidly and efficiently, aiding survival. However, little is known of the processes underlying information transmission and the complexity of information that can be exchanged. We used shoals of guppies to investigate how animals decide which individual to copy, and the extent of information that can be transferred. Naive guppies followed the first fish to move. However, although the speed and accuracy of foraging increased significantly during training, the first fish to move was not always the trained (knowledgeable) guppy. No significant difference was found between the number of guppies entering areas of varying food quality, supporting the hypothesis that these fish learn foraging locations by following and suggesting that leaders forage without considering the reduced personal reward arising from sharing a low-quality patch with followers. Animals that learn by copying thus appear limited in the amount of information they can receive, highlighting a selection pressure for more extensive means of transmitting information in complex environments.

AB Two-action experiments, in which observer individuals watch models use one of two alternative methods to achieve the same goal, have become recognized as a powerful method for studying social learning. We applied this approach to vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops, using an artificial fruit ('vervetable') which could be opened by either lifting a door panel on its front, or alternatively by sliding the panel to the left or right. In each of two groups a model was trained to lift the door and in two others the model slid it to either the left or right. Members of each group could then watch their model before the group was given access to multiple baited vervetables. Over the course of 100 openings we found a significant tendency for the lift and slide approaches to spread preferentially in the groups in which they were seeded. The same was true for slide left versus slide right, indicating these monkeys can attend to and learn from a fine level of detail in what others do. This effect cannot be explained by mere local enhancement since monkeys grasped a knob centred in the door to perform all techniques. Instead, imitation or emulation is implicated. No significant diminution of the tendency to adopt the seeded technique occurred among individuals learning later rather earlier in the study. Our results show that vervet monkeys have the capacity to learn from others by either emulation or imitation and what they learn has the potential to spread across their group.

AB Many male signallers convey information to female receivers in multimodal courtship displays. While much is known about how males vary in terms of signalling, variation in female detection of these multimodal signals is relatively unexplored. We suggest that there is a critical, albeit underdeveloped, link between multimodal sensory reception and individual variation in mate choice. This review addresses the potential effects of developmental and conditional factors (e.g. nutrient availability, hormone profiles and age) on female multimodal processing, and illustrates that differences in the (1) source of individual variation and (2) the number of sensory processing modes affected by this variation can influence the receiver's mate choice patterns. Based on these two factors, we outline novel predictions of preference functions and choosiness in a redundant multimodal signalling context. Moreover, we explore the theoretical implications of individual variation in multimodal signal perception in relation to sensory drive, honest signalling, assortative mating and intrasexual selection. We propose that understanding the role of variation in sensory processing and its relation to mate choice can help us better identify the factors that influence sender and receiver fitness, and subsequently the rate and direction of signal evolution.

AB Jumping spiders are known to rely on visual information when making predatory decisions, but the relative roles of global and local motion, shape and interior spatial detail in eliciting attack remain poorly resolved. We manipulated videos of crickets and presented jumping spiders, Phidippus audax, with choice tests. Consistent with previous studies, spiders more often approached videos depicting moving prey versus motionless prey. Spiders attended to local motion characteristics, preferring videos of natural cricket motion over videos of a snapshot of a cricket that moved across the screen with the same start-and-stop global motion pattern as the natural cricket. However, spiders showed no evidence of preference between moving images that differed in shape and interior spatial detail: a cricket snapshot and a rectangle of the same size and colour. These results indicate that spiders either cannot detect differences between the stimuli, or can detect differences but show no preference. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used an aversive conditioning protocol. Conditioning was effective, as we could train spiders to choose a moving snapshot over a natural cricket. However, we were unable to induce discrimination between cricket snapshots and rectangles, suggesting that spiders were unable to distinguish these images even when motivated to do so. There was no significant difference in the spiders' propensity to choose cricket videos with natural stop-and-start motion versus those without pauses, so we found no evidence that the commonly observed pausing behaviour of walking prey influences the propensity of spiders to attack. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that movement is more important than image shape for predatory decisions of this jumping spider.

AB In general, we assume that natural (predation-mediated) and sexual selection have opposing effects on the evolution of characters that serve as ornaments. Males of most swordtail fishes (genus Xiphophorus) have an elongation of the caudal fin known as the sword that is used to attract females, as it increases apparent body size of males. By increasing apparent body size, the sword may also attract the attention of predators or decrease the likelihood that a predator will attack. Using the green swordtail, Xiphophorus hellerii, we evaluated separately the effect of body size and the presence of the sword on the likelihood of being attacked by a predator. We conducted preference tests using a sympatric cichlid, Thorichthys ellioti, as a predator. For the effect of body size we used live pairs of male swordtails of different sizes without swords (surgically removed) as stimuli, and for the effect of the sword we used videos of male swordtails with and without their sword (digitally removed). We found no effect of body size, but the cichlid predators directed more bites towards individuals with swords. Despite their benefits in terms of attracting mates, the sword seems to increase the risk of being attacked by a predator and thus represents a trade-off between natural selection (mediated by predation) and sexual selection.

AB Sperm competition is an important component of postcopulatory sexual selection. Despite the fact that sperm traits may be important in determining fitness and thus may be under directional selection, they are often highly variable in mating systems with intense sperm competition. One possible explanation for this variation is that sperm traits vary with age. Age affects the expression of many life-history traits and sexual selection signals, but its influence on sperm traits is not well understood. In this study, we examined the correlation between individual age and sperm traits in a natural population of the American horseshoe crab. We compared five sperm traits (ejaculate size, concentration, total sperm ejaculated, velocity and viability) between males of three age categories. Young males ejaculated more total sperm and had significantly more concentrated sperm than old males. Males of different ages did not differ in sperm velocity or viability. Our results suggest that age influences traits associated with sperm quantity more than it does traits associated with sperm quality. Our results also suggest that individual age may be an important, but often overlooked, factor in studies examining sperm traits in natural populations.

AB Hormones regulate decision-making strategies, in particular by translating an individual's physiological state into decisions on major behavioural and life-history processes, such as reproduction. Corticosterone, a glucocorticoid hormone, has been gaining attention as a mediator of reproductive effort, and experimentally elevated corticosterone concentrations have been shown to disrupt reproduction in avian species. Here, we tested whether individual variation in corticosterone concentrations is related to the decision for brood abandonment in free-living great tits, Parus major. Because of harsh environmental conditions, many adults abandoned their first broods in 2010, enabling us to ask which physiological, environmental and individual characteristics increased the probability of nest desertion by both males and females. The best predictors of nest desertion were high stress-induced corticosterone levels in males and low average nestling mass. Furthermore, high stress-induced corticosterone levels in 2010 appeared to represent plastic responses to environmental conditions and reproductive investment: individual males that abandoned their nests in 2010 had higher stress-induced corticosterone concentrations and produced nestlings with lower average mass than in 2009, when nesting successfully. Females that abandoned their nests in 2010 had higher baseline corticosterone concentrations than in 2009, when nesting successfully. Also, males that renested after abandonment in 2010 had lower stress-induced corticosterone concentrations and nestlings with higher mass. Finally, pairs that abandoned but renested later in 2010 had similar fledgling success at the end of the season as those that did not abandon. These results indicate that an individual's reproductive decision is the result of a plastic modulation of the corticosterone stress response that influences reproductive decisions according to environmental conditions.

AB In cooperatively breeding vertebrate societies, contributions to offspring care can vary greatly between group members. Kin selection theory predicts that cooperation will be favoured when directed towards relatives and when the cost to benefit ratio is low. The fitness costs of helping in turn depend on the impact of energetic investments in care on future reproductive success, which is likely to vary between helpers. For example, investments may impact more on a young helper, which needs to invest energy in growth and is an inexperienced forager. We investigated how a key predictor of cost, food availability (estimated using rainfall), influences helping behaviour in the banded mongoose, Mungos mungo. In this cooperative carnivore, a variable number of group members breed while almost all help to rear the communal litter. Nonbreeding females and juvenile males helped less when food was scarce, reflecting the potentially high costs of weight loss and reduced growth on survival and future reproductive success. In contrast, adult males maintained their investment in care as food supply decreased, probably because body condition has relatively little impact on male reproductive success in this species. Breeding females (with pups in the communal litter) also maintained their helping effort as food supply decreased. Although mothers invested highly in care, there was no evidence that they preferentially cared for their own pups, probably because synchronized birthing scrambles maternity cues. Patterns of care in the banded mongoose thus seem to reflect the benefits gained from helping and the long-term fitness costs to the helper.

AB Various studies have reported that extrapair young outperform their within-pair half-siblings in fitness-relevant traits, suggesting indirect benefits of extrapair copulations for females. Recent studies, however, suggest that potential confounding maternal effects such as laying and hatching order may have been overlooked. In this study on blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, we investigated fledging behaviour, a potentially fitness-relevant trait, in relation to the paternity status of the offspring. We tested whether extrapair young differed from within-pair young in fledging order per se and after we controlled for hatching order, a potential confounding maternal effect. We found that male, but not female, extrapair young fledged earlier than their within-pair nestmates. This effect was partly mediated by the higher body mass of extrapair young, which is a major determinant of fledging order independent of paternity status. However, even when we controlled for body mass, a correlate of hatching order, male extrapair young still fledged earlier than their same-sex half-siblings, indicating that male extrapair nestlings may be at an advantage over their siblings.

AB Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain sex-related differences in foraging in sexually monomorphic seabirds. The 'intersexual competition' hypothesis suggests that parents are in competition and that the dominated sex must adapt its behaviour to avoid competing with the dominant one. The 'energetic constraint' hypothesis suggests that differential energetic requirements lead to different foraging behaviour. We examined sexual differences in foraging behaviour of a sexually monomorphic tropical seabird, the Barau's petrel, Pterodroma baraui, throughout the breeding period. We found sexual differences in foraging habitats and activities, but these were not consistent throughout the breeding period. During the prelaying exodus, males foraged further from the colony, in waters with greater surface chlorophyll concentration, and were more active than females. Males systematically took the first incubation shift, which was always longer than the others. However, no sex-related differences in foraging behaviour were observed during the chick-rearing period, both sexes sharing parental duties equally. We suggest that the sexual differences observed early in the breeding period are due to the specific needs of males and females. Females need to restore their body condition as quickly as possible after laying, which forces males to take the first long incubation shift at the nest. This may explain why males forage more actively during the prelaying exodus, to prepare for this long fasting period. Our results support for the first time the 'energy constraint' hypothesis to explain sexual differences in behaviour of a small, monomorphic procellariiform seabird.

ID LINEARITY; TRANSITIVITY; DYNAMICS; PUZZLE
AB The hierarchical organization of dominance relations among animals has wide-ranging implications in social evolution. The structure of dominance relations has often been measured using indices of linearity (e. g. Landau's h, Kendall's K): the degree to which dominance relations adhere to a linear hierarchy. An alternative measure is the transitivity of dominance relations among sets of three players that all interact with each other, a measure we call triangle transitivity (t(tri)). Triangle transitivity and linearity are essentially equivalent when dominance relations of all dyads are known, but such complete observations are rare in empirical studies. Triangle transitivity has two major advantages: it does not require 'filling in' of unobserved relations, and its expected value is constant across group sizes. We use a social network perspective to demonstrate a property of transitivity in random directed networks (on average, three-fourths of complete triads are transitive) and show that empirical dominance networks are often significantly more transitive than random networks. Using 101 published dominance matrices we show that published algorithms for assessing linearity underestimate the level of social orderliness, particularly in larger groups, which tend to have more null dyads. Thus, previous puzzlement over the decrease in estimated linearity in larger groups could be due largely to the bias introduced by random filling of null dyads. We argue that triangle transitivity will allow researchers to focus on important processes underlying the dynamics of dominance, such as spatial segregation, avoidance of interactions by certain individuals and detailed temporal patterns in the ontogeny of hierarchy formation.

AB Animals commonly acquire information about the environment by monitoring how others interact with it. The importance of social information use probably varies among species. In particular, many migratory birds breeding in northern latitudes rely on social information provided by resident tits when making important decisions and are able to copy or reject selectively the decisions of tits exhibiting good or bad fitness correlates, respectively. However, little is known about the role of social information use among resident tits. In a field experiment we tested whether great tits, Parus major, given a choice between two novel alternative features on adjacent nest sites, copy or reject conspecific choice represented by a simulated tit nest nearby, when the nest exhibits a high or low fitness correlate (clutch size). In contrast to the results in the interspecific setting, the portrayed fitness of the simulated nest did not affect tits' nest site choices. However, the age of males had an effect, irrespective of the fitness correlate. Pairs with an old male preferred, while pairs with a young male tended to reject, the nest site choices of the simulated previously settled conspecifics. This result is surprising, as the final nest site choice in this species is presumably made by females, whose age and other phenotypic traits did not have an effect here. Our results imply stronger influence of the male great tits on nest site choice than previously thought. Dominance relationships and intraspecific competition are possible explanations for the age-dependent patterns in social information use. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In cooperatively breeding animals, in which nonbreeding subordinates assist in rearing offspring born to dominants, breeders and helpers may be in conflict over their respective contributions to offspring care and selection may favour breeders that use aggression to elevate the work rates of helpers. We tested the prediction that dominant female meerkats, Suricata suricatta, should increase aggression towards subordinates when the need for help is higher, by playing back recordings of pup begging calls to simulate increased need for help. Second, we tested the prediction that dominants should reduce aggression when subordinates help more, by playing back recordings of feeding calls to simulate elevated pup provisioning rates by subordinates. Neither of the two playback experiments affected rates of aggressive interactions between breeding females and helpers. Instead, breeding females increased their own level of pup provisioning in response to increased pup begging. Hence, our results do not support a role of aggression in regulating helping behaviour in meerkats, but suggest that pup provisioning can be explained by direct and/or indirect benefits derived from helping. As yet, firm evidence that breeders use aggression to promote helping by subordinates in cooperative animal societies remains elusive. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Experiments using captive birds involve artificial lighting sources, which are often conventional low-frequency (LF; 100 Hz) fluorescent light. Many bird species may be able to perceive the flicker emitted by these lights and this may have important consequences for their behaviour, physiology and welfare. We determined whether European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, react differently to being housed under LF versus high-frequency (HF; > 30 kHz, a rate imperceptible to any animal) fluorescent light. Birds were monitored and the lighting type changed half way through the experiment. While we found no difference in the mass or haematocrit levels of birds housed under HF and LF lighting, birds exhibited higher levels of myoclonus (involuntary muscle spasms) and preening but reduced jumping, eating, drinking and bill wiping under LF light. Birds also experienced lower basal corticosterone levels under LF light, suggesting that they are experiencing chronic stress, as prolonged exposure to a stressor is known to suppress corticosterone production. Birds initially exposed to LF light exhibited behavioural changes over the 3 weeks of the experiment, suggesting that this initial exposure to LF lighting had carryover effects on the birds' behaviour. Our results demonstrate that starlings are sensitive to LF light and emphasize the importance of considering experimental lighting conditions. Our results also highlight the importance of ensuring the standardization of flicker rates as part of any study gathering behavioural or physiological data. From a welfare perspective, our results confirm that it would be better for wild birds to be housed under HF light. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB While studies demonstrating variation in female mating preferences are increasing, we still know very little about the factors that contribute to this variation, and we are therefore unable to predict how selection on males will vary due to female preference. A previous study of Xiphophorus multilineatus detected variation in female mate preference, where smaller females had a weaker strength of preference for males that court (courters) as compared to small males that use sneak-chase behaviour (sneakers). We tested the hypothesis that female experience with biased frequencies of courter and sneaker males would result in negative frequency-dependent selection on these male alternative mating strategies through female mate choice. We examined the preferences of naive females, females given experience with different frequencies of courter/ sneaker males in laboratory mesocosm treatments, and wild-caught females collected when the frequencies of males were sneaker biased and equal. The frequency of courter to sneaker males experienced in the laboratory significantly influenced female preference for courter males, but not in the direction we predicted for one end of the frequency distribution: the weakest strength of preference for courter males was from the treatment where courter males were less frequent. The pattern detected in wild-caught females was similar to the pattern detected in the laboratory-mated females, and together they suggest that when frequencies are biased towards either type of male, smaller females have a weaker preference for courter males.

AB Sperm competition occurs when a female mates with more than one male, and the sperm of those males compete directly over fertilizing her eggs. In polyandrous animals, males can respond to the perceived risk of sperm competition by flexibly adjusting aspects of their development and reproductive investment. In high-risk scenarios we might expect males to accelerate development so as to mature quickly and locate receptive females first and/or transfer more sperm so as to outcompete rival sperm. We examined these predictions using the false garden mantid, Pseudomantis albofimbriata, a medium-sized praying mantid found on the east coast of Australia. Males are less than half the mass of females. Sexual cannibalism occurs in up to 40% of interactions, highlighting the importance of investing optimally in reproductive opportunities for males. We housed juvenile males in two operational sex ratio treatments: three males, one female ( high risk of sperm competition) and one male, three females ( low risk). We found no evidence of accelerated development in the high-risk group; instead, high-risk males took longer to mature. Possibly, males exposed to a higher risk of sperm competition delay maturity in order to invest in testes development and sperm production. We also found that males reared in the high-risk treatment transferred significantly more sperm than males reared in the low-risk treatment, providing evidence of strategic ejaculation in male P. albofimbriata. This is the first study demonstrating a male response to the perceived risk of sperm competition via delayed development and increased ejaculate investment in praying mantids.

AB Recent evidence indicates that dogs' sociocognitive abilities and behaviour in a test situation are shaped by both genetic factors and life experiences. We used the 'unsolvable task' paradigm to investigate the effect of breed and age/experience on the use of human-directed gazing behaviour. Following a genetic classification based on recent genome analyses, dogs were allocated to three breed groups, namely Primitive, Hunting/Herding and Molossoid. Furthermore, we tested dogs at 2 months, 4.5 months and as adults. The test consisted of three solvable trials in which dogs could obtain food by manipulating a plastic container followed by an unsolvable trial in which obtaining the food became impossible. The dogs' behaviour towards the apparatus and the people present was analysed. At 2 months no breed group differences emerged and although human-directed gazing behaviour was observed in approximately half of the pups, it occurred for brief periods, suggesting that the aptitude to use human-directed gazing as a request for obtaining help probably develops at a later date when dogs have had more experience with human communication. Breed group differences, however, did emerge strongly in adult dogs and, although less pronounced, also in 4.5-month-old subjects, with dogs in the Hunting/Herding group showing significantly more human-directed gazing behaviour than dogs in the other two breed groups. These results suggest that, although the domestication process may have shaped the dog's human-directed communicative abilities, the later selection for specific types of work might also have had a significant impact on their emergence.

AB We present an agent-based model for the nest site selection process of the open-nesting red dwarf honeybee, Apis florea. Our main aim was to determine how nest site requirements affect the bees' decision-making process. We either calculated our model parameters from experimental data or chose them so that our model would generate similar numbers of dancing bees and dance followers to those observed in real swarms with access to an abundance of suitable nest sites in all directions. We found that A. florea is less capable of making a collective decision on a new nest site when the area occupied by suitable sites is small compared to when suitable sites are abundant. Increasing the use of information regarding the location of potential nest sites or the accuracy of the information available enhanced the decision-making ability of A. florea when nest sites were scarce. We also found that swarm guidance might be hindered when suitable nest site areas are wide apart. We therefore examined two possible mechanisms for increasing directional agreement among dancers: mimicry of unverified dance information and self-regulation by inhibiting or changing dance behaviour based on observations of other dances. We show that, even at low levels, dance mimicry greatly enhances the ability of an A. florea swarm to make a decision and reduces the time to make a decision. However, in the presence of mimicry errors propagate through the swarm. Self-regulation had little or no effect, probably because of the overall low levels of dance activity present on the swarm at any given time. Our model results suggest that A. florea's decision-making process allows swarms to locate a new nest site provided nest sites are abundant, even when they are of similar quality.

AB The use and manufacture of tools has been considered to be cognitively demanding and thus a possible evolutionary driving factor of intelligence. Animal tool use provides the opportunity to investigate whether the use of tools evolved in conjunction with enhanced physical cognitive abilities. However, success in physical tasks may simply reflect enhanced general learning abilities and not cognitive adaptations to tool use. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared general learning and physical cognitive abilities between the tool-using woodpecker finch, Cactospiza pallida, and its close relative, the small tree finch, Camarhynchus parvulus. Since not all woodpecker finches use tools, we also compared tool-using and nontool-using individuals, predicting that domain-specific experience should lead tool-using woodpecker finches to outperform nontool-users in a task that is similar to their natural tool use. Contrary to our predictions, woodpecker finches did not outperform small tree finches in either of the physical tasks and excelled in only one of the general learning tasks, and tool-using woodpecker finches did not outperform nontool-using woodpecker finches in the physical task closely resembling tool use. Our results provide no evidence that tool use in woodpecker finches has evolved in conjunction with enhanced physical cognition or that domain-specific experience hones domain-specific skills. This is an important contribution to a growing body of evidence indicating that animal tool use, even that which seems complex, does not necessitate specialized cognitive adaptations.

AB Parasites are known to affect an array of characteristics of their hosts, including morphology, physiology and behaviour. We examined the foraging and antipredator behaviour of rainbow darters, Etheostoma caeruleum, that were parasitized by glochidia larvae of freshwater mussels (Ptychobranchus occidentalis and Venustaconcha pleasii: Unionidae). Glochidia attach to the gills of the host and become encapsulated in host tissue. Over a period of days or weeks the larvae develop into free-living juveniles, which then leave the host. Parasitized darters increased ventilation rates (either early in the infestation or at the height of the infestation), were less active during foraging trials, lost more body size than nonparasitized darters and showed significantly weaker responses to predation risk (signalled by the presence of a chemical alarm cue). Therefore, even for a relatively short-term infection, parasitized darters may pay a cost in terms of decreased growth and decreased probability of survival.

AB Consistent differences in behaviour, termed behavioural types (BTs) are well documented in the animal kingdom. Relatively little is known, however, about how and why consistency is maintained within populations. In recent years, theoretical work suggests that life history trade-offs may be an important mechanism driving the maintenance of interindividual variation in BTs. We used a laboratory population of a clonal vertebrate, the mangrove killifish, as a model organism. This fish is an internally self-fertilizing simultaneous hermaphrodite that exhibits within-genotype homozygosity. We utilized 20 genotypes to examine BT plasticity (boldness and exploration), the development of behavioural correlations, and relationships between life history strategy and BTs at five age points during ontogeny. We found that BT scores increased during early ontogeny and reached an asymptote near sexual maturity. We also found considerable variation in BT developmental plasticity at the genotype level. Moreover, although genotypes exhibited high levels of plasticity in BTs, strong, significant positive correlations between exploration and boldness emerged from day 61 onwards. Furthermore, we observed no difference between genotypes in growth rate and growth was unrelated to BTs. Contrary to our predictions, we found that while genotypes differed in their age at first reproduction and reproductive output, these differences were unrelated to BT expression prior to and following sexual maturity. We discuss these results in relation to mechanisms proposed to drive interindividual variation in BTs and we highlight the potential of the mangrove killifish as a model organism for animal personality studies.

AB In cooperatively breeding vertebrates, investment strategies of breeders and helpers may be affected by the sex of offspring that they provision because the fitness benefits gained from caring for sons or daughters will depend upon the fitness impacts of positive (i.e. local resource enhancement) and negative (i.e. local resource competition) social interactions between relatives. We investigated the relationship between provisioning effort by breeders and helpers and the sex of nestlings that they provision, using long-term data over 16 years and detailed behavioural observation of interactions between carers and offspring in a cooperatively breeding species, the long-tailed tit, Aegithalos caudatus. We predicted preferential care for male nestlings because males are the more helpful sex in the kin-selected social system of long-tailed tits. However, we found that despite the significant size difference between male and female nestlings, there was no evidence of facultative adjustment of provisioning effort by either breeders or helpers in relation to brood sex ratio. In addition, we found no evidence for sex-biased provisioning by carers, and no bias in the feeds received by nestlings according to their sex. Thus, we conclude that the provisioning strategy of long-tailed tits does not incorporate differential investment according to sex. We suggest that the unpredictable nature of helping in the atypical cooperative breeding system of long-tailed tits makes random provisioning effort in relation to nestling sex the best option for carers.

AB Learned recognition of novel predators allows prey to respond to ecologically relevant threats. Prey could minimize the costs associated with learning the identity of both predators and nonpredators by making educated guesses on the identity of a novel species based on their similarities with known predators and nonpredators, a process known as generalization. Here, we tested whether juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, have the ability to generalize information from a known predator (experiment 1) or a known harmless species (experiment 2) to closely related but novel species. In experiment 1, we taught juvenile trout to recognize a predatory pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus, by pairing pumpkinseed odour with conspecific alarm cues or a distilled water control. We then tested the trout for a response to pumpkinseeds and to novel longear sunfish, Lepomis megalotis (same genus as pumpkinseed), rock bass, Ambloplites rupestris (same family as pumpkinseed) or yellow perch, Perca flavescens (different family). Trout showed strong learned recognition of pumpkinseed and longear sunfish odour and a weak learned response to rock bass odour but no recognition of yellow perch. In experiment 2, we used latent inhibition to teach juvenile trout that pumpkinseeds were harmless. During subsequent predator learning trials, trout did not learn to recognize pumpkinseed or longear sunfish odour as potential threats, but they did learn that rock bass and yellow perch were threatening. Taken together, these results demonstrate that juvenile rainbow trout can generalize learned recognition of both predator and nonpredator odours based on the phylogenetic relatedness of predators.

AB Costs associated with escalated fighting may be minimized where individuals are able to gather information regarding the likely outcome of conflicts. In particular, the ability to assess resource-holding potential (RHP) has been shown to be important in determining the dynamics of animal contests. While assessment rules have been investigated in contests in a range of species, little is known about the potential for assessment in contests between species. We examined the role of assessment in usurpation contests between the paper wasp Polistes dominulus and the social parasite Polistes semenowi. First, we investigated whether parasite clypeal patterns function as signals of RHP by staging contests with parasites in which the clypeal pattern was concealed with paint. Second, we examined the importance of body size as a determinant of RHP. Finally, we explored whether individuals use information about their own RHP, and that of their rivals, in deciding when to withdraw. We found no evidence that parasite clypeal patterns act to signal RHP to hosts: initial fights were neither longer nor more intense when the patterns were concealed. We also found no evidence for RHP assessment during contests: although body size predicted contest outcome, fight duration and intensity were not significantly related to either winner or loser size. We suggest that the high value of the nest to both parties, combined with the potential for 'divisive' asymmetries in RHP between hosts and parasites, may result in selection for escalated conflict over rival assessment during usurpation fights.

AB Many animals store food in small, widely dispersed scatter hoards or in large larder hoards in burrows or other centralized locations. Kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) show an unusual amount of variation in food-hoarding behaviour both between and within species. I used laboratory trials to characterize individual variation in food hoarding by two species of kangaroo rats, Merriam's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys merriami, and Ord's kangaroo rats, Dipodomys ordii. Trials were done in arenas with sites for scatter hoarding and larder hoarding, and individuals were tested twice to assess the repeatability of their behaviour. I also removed larder hoards or scatter hoards from some subjects to test their response to simulated cache theft. Males of both species were much more repeatable than females in larder-hoarding propensity, and this was due to greater variation in mean values between males as well as greater variation between trials for individual females. For Merriam's kangaroo rats, males were less likely to replace lost larder hoards than were females, but the reverse was true for Ord's kangaroo rats. Sex differences in repeatability of food-hoarding behaviour were consistent with the possibility of alternative mating strategies in male kangaroo rats, while differences in response to cache pilferage between males of the two species were consistent with differences in aggressive behaviour associated with body size. This study of kangaroo rats illustrates the importance of behavioural plasticity as a dimension of personality that may differ in males and females.

AB Female preferences are frequently invoked to explain the widespread occurrence of elaborate male ornaments, yet empirical data demonstrating such preferences are sometimes equivocal or even contradictory. In the wolf spider Schizocosa stridulans, despite evidence of strong female choice, prior research has been unable to link the conspicuous sexually dimorphic foreleg ornamentation of males to their mating success. We conducted three experiments aimed at determining the function of this previously enigmatic ornamentation. Our first two experiments used males with phenotypically modified foreleg phenotypes in simple and complex mating environments in order to examine the relationship between the presence/absence of ornamentation and male mating success. In both experiments, we found no relationship: courtship rate was the sole predictor of mating success. In a third experiment, we used males with naturally varying foreleg ornamentation in mating trials. Ornamentation was subsequently quantified and we again examined the factors influencing male mating success. As in our first two experiments, we found courtship rate to be a good predictor of mating success. Additionally, we discovered that foreleg ornamentation and courtship rate interact to influence male mating success. At low courtship rates, males with more foreleg ornamentation have a mating advantage, whereas at high courtship rates, males with less foreleg ornamentation have a mating advantage. We discuss several potential explanations for these results. In summary, we provide the first evidence of a benefit of foreleg ornamentation in male S. stridulans and suggest that this benefit is realized by the interaction between ornamentation and courtship rate.

AB Animals can copy behaviour of heterospecifics (interspecific social learning), but it is not known whether social-learning strategies postulated for conspecific contexts, such as selectively copying individuals (or behaviours) that are more successful or common than the observer, apply here. A recent study found evidence for biased interspecific acquisition of nest site feature preference depending on observed fitness of the demonstrator (clutch size). We experimentally tested whether migratory pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, females, given a choice between two novel alternative behavioural traits of nest site feature choice, copy or reject the experimentally induced choice exhibited by simulated resident tit (Parus spp.) nests, when those nests portray a high or low fitness correlate (clutch size). Flycatchers were more likely to choose the opposite trait when the exhibited choice was associated with low simulated tit clutch size, demonstrating active rejection. Flycatchers had a strong overall preference to take over the tit nest site. We conclude that animals in the wild can respond to observable heterospecific fitness correlates when making decisions. Our experiment confirmed the existence of a strategy to reject behaviours exhibited by poorly performing individuals, complementing the already proposed social-learning strategies. By affecting the niche overlap of co-occurring species utilizing similar resources, interspecific social learning may affect species interactions and community structure.

AB We studied the simultaneous activity patterns of a breeding wolf, Canis lupus, pair and five adult moose, Alces alces, cows from April to November 2004 in a wolf territory in southeastern Norway. All study animals were GPS collared, and we used a total of 8297 fixes to analyse their temporal activity patterns. We examined the daily activity rhythm of the two species and how this varied seasonally through the study period, and investigated the association in activity patterns between the two species. Wolf activity peaked at dawn. The distance moved per time unit and the linearity of the movement were higher in wolves than in moose, but both species showed a decrease in these variables in June, coinciding with the denning and calving seasons. With the exception of the summer months when the activity of wolves and moose was limited by the raising of offspring, we found no correlation between the temporal activities of the two species. Hence, we did not find support for the hypothesis that the wolves and moose in Scandinavia have adjusted to each other's activity patterns. We discuss the results in light of the relative density of the two species and the intensive human harvest of moose, and hypothesize that synchronicity of predator-prey activity patterns may be ratio dependent.

AB Students of animal communication face significant challenges when deciding how to categorize calls into subunits, calls and call series. Here, we use algorithms designed to parse human speech to test different approaches for categorizing calls of killer whales. Killer whale vocalizations have traditionally been categorized by humans into discrete call types. These calls often contain internal spectral shifts, periods of silence and synchronously produced low-and high-frequency components, suggesting that they may be composed of subunits. We describe and compare three different approaches for modelling Norwegian killer whale calls. The first method considered the whole call as the basic unit of analysis. Inspired by human speech-processing techniques, the second and third methods represented the calls in terms of subunits. Subunits may provide a more parsimonious approach to modelling the vocal stream of Norwegian killer whale calls since (1) there were fewer subunits than call types and (2) nearly 75% of all call types shared at least one subunit. We show that contour traces from stereotyped Norwegian killer whale calls yielded similar automatic classification performance using either whole calls or subunits. We also demonstrate that subunits derived from Norwegian stereotyped calls were detected in some Norwegian variable (nonstereotyped) calls as well as the stereotyped calls of other killer whale populations. Further work is required to test whether killer whales use subunits to generate and categorize their vocal repertoire. 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Extraneous sounds have a variety of effects on animals; they may interfere with communication, cause physical harm, increase wariness, influence settlement decisions, or they may cause distractions in ways that increase vulnerability to predation. We designed a study to investigate the effects of changing both the amplitude and duration of an acoustic stimulus on distraction in a terrestrial hermit crab (Coenobita clypeatus). In experiment 1, we replicated the key findings from a field result: crabs hid more slowly in response to a silent visual stimulus when we simultaneously broadcast a white noise than they did when in a silent condition. In experiment 2, we altered the noise duration and found that a long noise generated greater latencies to hide than a short noise. In experiment 3, we increased the noise amplitude and found that hide latency increased with higher-intensity auditory stimuli. These experiments demonstrate a variety of stimulus factors that influence distraction. Our results suggest that prey animals could be in greater danger from predators when in an environment with auditory distractions. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Integration into human societies requires dogs to express adaptable social attitudes, involving high levels of attention to other individuals. In the present study, we developed a new behavioural test, to characterize selective attention towards humans. In the task, the dogs were exposed to the owner and an unfamiliar person, repeatedly entering the experimental room and leaving through different doors; at the end of the sequence the dogs were allowed to approach the doors. Attention was measured as the average length of gaze bouts and as the overall duration of visual orientation towards the different targets. Dogs gave preferential attention to the owner, who received longer gaze bouts and greater overall attention than the stranger. The preference was confirmed by the significant proportion of dogs that directed attention to the owner's door at the end of the task. A modified version of the task was employed to measure dogs' attention when the person's head was not visible. This condition caused a decrease in attention parameters towards the owner. To determine the effects of old age on attention, the two tasks were then administered to dogs aged 7 years and older. Compared to adults, aged dogs showed lower owner-directed attention when the owner was not in sight and were more likely not to move at the end of the task. The results provide the first evidence that dogs' interspecific attention depends on the nature of the dog-human relationship, on the availability of some distinctive features of the social stimulus and on the age of the dog.

AB Of key importance for understanding cooperative societies is the way in which reproductive opportunities are distributed among group members. Traditionally, skew has been thought of as a product of intrasexual competition. However, cooperatively breeding species often live in mixed-sex groups, so the behaviour of one sex has the potential to influence skew in the other. We addressed the importance of inter-and intrasexual conflict in determining reproductive skew through a study of paternity sharing in the cooperatively breeding banded mongoose, Mungus mungo. Unlike banded mongoose females, where reproductive skew is low, males exhibited high skew, with 85% of paternities being assigned to the three oldest males in each group. Individual males appeared unable to monopolize reproduction because females come into oestrus in synchrony and mate multiply. Instead, older males increased their success by mate guarding the oldest, most fecund females. Our findings therefore highlight the importance of mate choice in males and reveal the behavioural differences between the sexes that generate reproductive skew. They also emphasize the considerable influence that female behaviour can have on male reproductive skew. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Urban areas have both positive and negative influences on wildlife. For terrestrial mammals, one of the principal problems is the risk associated with moving through the environment while foraging. We examined nocturnal patterns of movement of urban-dwelling hedgehogs in relation to (1) the risks posed by predators and motor vehicles and (2) nightly weather patterns. Hedgehogs preferentially utilized the gardens of semidetached and terraced houses. However, females, but not males, avoided the larger back gardens of detached houses, which contain more of the habitat features selected by badgers. This difference in the avoidance of predation risk is probably associated with sex differences in breeding behaviour. Differences in nightly movement patterns were consistent with strategies associated with mating behaviour and the accumulation of fat reserves for hibernation. Hedgehogs also differed in behaviour associated with the risks posed by humans; they avoided actively foraging near roads and road verges, but did not avoid crossing roads per se. They were, however, significantly more active after midnight when there was a marked reduction in vehicle and foot traffic. In particular, responses to increased temperature, which is associated with increased abundance of invertebrate prey, were only observed after midnight. This variation in the timing of bouts of activity would reduce the risks associated with human activities. There were also profound differences in both area ranged and activity between years which warrant further investigation. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Selection pressures during domestication are thought to lead to an enhanced ability to use human-given cues. Horses fulfil a wide variety of roles for humans and have been domesticated for at least 5000 years but their ability to read human cues has not been widely studied. We tested the ability of 28 horses to attend to human-given cues in an object choice task. We included five different cues: distal sustained pointing, momentary tapping, marker placement, body orientation and gaze ( head) alternation. Horses were able to use the pointing and marker placement cues spontaneously but not the tapping, body orientation and gaze alternation cues. The overall pattern of responding suggests that horses may use cues that provide stimulus enhancement at the time of choice and do not have an understanding of the communicative nature of the cues given. As such, their proficiency at this task appears to be inferior to that of domestic dogs, Canis lupus familiaris, but similar to that of domestic goats, Caprus hircus.

AB Dispersal is a key factor affecting the dynamics and genetic structure of populations. Patterns of natal dispersal vary widely depending on the selection pressures that each species encounters, but the underlying factors determining this variation are poorly understood. We studied the pattern of natal dispersal in a small passerine, the vinous-throated parrotbill, Paradoxornis webbianus, using both direct ringing data and indirect genetic methods. The social structure of this species is characterized by group living without apparent territorial behaviour. The dispersal rate of juveniles from their natal groups was moderate (about 40%) and dispersal distance was short, most individuals moving to neighbouring flocks. Sibling groups that included both sexes usually dispersed or were philopatric together so that they were found in the same winter flock where pairing occurs. Thus, the avoidance of inbreeding or intrasexual competition among siblings appears not to affect natal dispersal in this species. Instead, our results suggest that the benefits of dispersing in groups and/or selection of kin structure within social groups via kin-selected reproductive benefits may promote the observed dispersal pattern: sibling associations without separation of the sexes. This behaviour may have important implications for the kin structure of populations and the evolution of sociality. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus), adult males and lactating females form preferential associations, or 'friendships', that provide protection against potentially infanticidal attacks. Little is known about the mechanisms by which males and females form friendships, or the function of friendships for males. We examined the relationship between mating activity, paternity and friendships over a 3-year period. A male's proportion of consort activity with a female within and outside of her period of most likely conception, along with his dominance rank, each contributed importantly in models of paternity outcomes and formation of friendships. In 87% of births, the male that monopolized the greatest proportion of a female's consort days during her last conceptive cycle was the father of her offspring. In 82% of the births where the female's primary consort partner was present at parturition, he became her friend. When the primary consort partner was absent at parturition, females formed friendships with males that had monopolized the second or third greatest proportion of their previous consort days. Similarly, 78% of males became friends with females with whom they had obtained their greatest consort success. Such a flexible strategy based on probabilistic assessment of paternity may be adaptive for females, given unpredictable fluctuations in male presence within the group. In a mating system with high dominance-based reproductive skew, males may benefit by investing preferentially in those infants that they are most likely to have fathered.

AB The exploratory activity of individuals aimed at collecting information about potential future breeding sites is known as prospecting. We studied prospecting behaviour in the colonial lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni, using detailed information from radiomarked individuals, whose breeding attempts we terminated at the chick stage, and intensive videotape recording of nests. Half of the radiomarked individuals actively prospected nests in both their own and foreign colonies and they visited colonies up to 7400 m away from their own breeding colony. The presence and number of prospectors arriving at a given nest were influenced by parameters at both the colony and the nest scale. Prospector visits per nest increased with colony productivity and decreased with colony size. The latter does not necessarily mean that prospectors avoid large colonies but rather may be consequence of a dilution effect in colonies where more potential nests can be prospected. The number of prospectors attracted per nest was positively associated with colony connectivity, indicating that both high spatial colony isolation and a small number of breeding pairs in nearby colonies reduced the arrival of prospectors at a given nest. Finally, prospector visits per nest increased and then decreased with parental feeding rates, indicating this parental activity can attract prospectors up to a certain threshold at which nest owners visit their nests frequently enough to keep prospectors away. Overall, this study suggests that prospecting is the mechanism of acquiring public information that could ultimately determine breeding dispersal decisions and the growth and dynamics observed in breeding aggregations.

AB When animals live in groups, the ability to discriminate group members from nonmembers allows individuals to adjust their behaviour in ways that enhance both individual and group fitness. In social insects, especially bees, this kind of recognition has mainly been studied with reference to colony-based social interactions, but they also interact in other kinds of group contexts. In the facultatively social carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica, individuals of both sexes interact repeatedly, in such activities as cooperative brood raising by females, territorial competition by males, and matings near nest entrances. In light of these varied interactions, in which the ability to discriminate familiar from unfamiliar individuals might be advantageous, the aim of our study was to determine whether X. virginica adults are capable of nestmate recognition. Nestmates were defined operationally as bees that were caught at the same nest entrance after spending the night together, whereas non-nestmates were from different nests. We used circle tube assays of male-male, female-female and male-female dyads to compare rates of aggressive (pushing, biting and C-postures) and tolerant/cooperative (head-to-head touching and passing) behaviour in nestmates versus non-nestmates. In general, aggression occurred sooner and more frequently among non-nestmates than among nestmates, whereas tolerance was more common among nestmates. This indicates that male and female bees can recognize familiar individuals of both sexes and adjust their behaviour accordingly. Since tested individuals may have been nestmates for less than 24 h, this further suggests that both female and male bees may learn the identities of their nestmates quickly.

AB While the prevalence of animal personalities has become apparent in recent years, the importance of animal personalities in determining the outcome of sexual selection remains imperfectly understood. In particular, there are few data on whether repeatable personality differences among males are associated with repeatable outcomes of male-male interactions within the mating context. Using the bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, we examined the repeatability of individual differences in mating behaviours and the stability of dominance rank, which partially determines mating success in this species. The expression of male behaviours in competition between males and female courtship was significantly repeatable over a 5-week period; the number of aggressive behaviours to males and females, and the number of courtship bouts had significant repeatabilities of 0.71, 0.72 and 0.65, respectively. A male's personality or behavioural type within the mating context, as measured by a composite measure of the overall level of mating behaviour activity, was significantly repeatable at 0.75. Males showed repeatable, linear dominance hierarchies, and a male's rank in the hierarchy was highly correlated with his behavioural type. Neither behavioural type nor dominance rank was associated with body size or body condition. The repeatability of behavioural types and stability in the outcomes of aggressive interactions suggest that these behavioural phenotypes are inherent characteristics of individuals rather than short-term responses to recent social experience or daily levels of food or stress, and may potentially have an early environmental and/or genetic basis.

AB Simultaneous effects of mate guarding on a male's energy intake and expenditure have not been measured. We tested whether guarding males of the western Mexican whiptail lizard, Aspidoscelis costata, reduce energy intake and increase expenditure of energy on male-male aggression. Also, we tested whether guarding males calibrate their aggressive behaviour and feeding to aggression from male rivals (a proxy of their female's probability of extrapair copulation) and body size of the guarded female (positively correlated with fecundity in this species). Observation during and after guarding showed that guarding males (1) ate 77% fewer prey/h and 54% smaller prey, (2) initiated 87% more agonistic interactions/h and (3) participated in 120% more escalated agonistic interactions/h than when alone. Also, guarding males initiated more aggressions when aggression from other males and female size were greater. These results indicate that mate guarding is costly for males because of simultaneous reduction in energy intake and increased expenditure on aggression, and that males incur higher guarding costs when competition with other males and female reproductive value are greater. These costs of mate guarding probably result in negative energy balances that could reduce male fitness through diminished survival. The evolutionary persistence of mate guarding by males can be explained if the net gain in fitness derived from guarding more than offsets its survival costs.

AB Birdsong is often regarded as an aggressive signal. More specifically, particular singing behaviours are hypothesized to be threatening, including song type matching, frequency matching, song overlapping, song type switching and low-amplitude song. The term aggressive signal should be reserved for behaviours that are associated with, and, in that sense, signal aggressive escalation. Three criteria are relevant to whether a signal should be classified as aggressive: (1) whether the signal increases in aggressive contexts (the context criterion); (2) whether the signal predicts aggressive escalation by the signaller (the predictive criterion); and (3) whether receivers respond to the signal (the response criterion). Adequate evidence on all three criteria is not available for most putative aggressive signals. The evidence that is available suggests that low-amplitude song and perhaps frequency matching are strongly aggressive signals in some species; that type matching is not a signal of attack but may be a signal of lower levels of aggressive escalation; that type switching can be either a signal of escalation or of de-escalation; and that overlapping may not be a signal at all. Song performance is probably mainly a signal of male quality, but may additionally signal aggressive escalation in some cases. We propose that more attention be devoted to testing the predictive criterion: an aggressive signal should either predict attack, or if not, it should predict escalation to the next higher level of aggressive signalling, and each higher level of signalling should more reliably predict the ultimate response of actual attack.

AB To understand how sexual selection works, it is important to distinguish between the mechanisms underlying mating success. One of the basic questions is to differentiate between the importance of territory-related resources (gained through male-male competition) and male quality in female choice. Few studies, however, have tried to separate these two often intercorrelated variables. We randomized territory quality among male pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, and studied which male traits were associated with their success in female mate choice. Females appeared to choose multiple male traits in the wild when the males were not allowed to choose territories before female choice for males. Males with a long tarsus, large white wing patch and versatile song were favoured by females. In addition, the contrast of ultraviolet (UV) reflectance in the white wing patch relative to its background, that is, the dorsal brown-black coloration of the males, appeared to be an important mate choice cue. The UV reflectance had a stronger effect on pairing success in dark males than in brown ones. An experimental manipulation of the UV reflectance revealed that the UV coloration of the males appeared to be used in female choice early but not late in the pairing season, which suggests time-dependent plasticity in female choice. Our study thus exemplifies the complexity of mate choice; it is both temporally constrained and dependent on multiple ornaments. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Should prey retain an ability to respond to the sight of their extinct predators? The multipredator hypothesis (Blumstein 2006, Ethology, 112, 209-217) assumes that antipredator adaptations evolve together and thus prey may respond to extinct predators as long as they have experience with other predators. We tested this prediction in yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, a species with both extant and extinct predators. Marmots were baited to a predetermined location and then shown one of five life-size photographic stimuli: a medium-size sub-Saharan antelope, the gray duiker, Silvicapra grimmia, as a control stimulus; a red fox, Vulpes vulpes, a low-risk predator; a coyote, Canis latrans, a higher risk predator; a mountain lion, Felis concolor, an extant predator, but one with which our population had no ontogenetic experience; and a wolf, Canis lupus, an extinct predator. Marmots responded differently to each stimulus: they stopped foraging after seeing the duiker, engaged in low vigilance after seeing the fox, seemed to monitor the coyote, fled the wolf, and engaged in high vigilance (and on one occasion alarm-called) in response to the mountain lion. This pattern of responses was consistent with the different risks associated with each species: foxes required monitoring but marmots could generally escape them, coyotes routinely kill adult marmots, solitary hunting mountain lions might be dissuaded from attack once detected, and socially hunting wolves were a very high risk predator, which would be best hidden from. The pattern of responses was not explained simply by stimulus size, stimulus detectability, or stimulus similarity. These results are consistent with the multipredator hypothesis: visual predator discrimination for ontogenetically and evolutionarily novel predators may be maintained in yellow-bellied marmots by extant predation risk.

AB Male insects that are unable to replenish sperm supplies between matings can suffer fitness costs either because their mates are more likely to accept subsequent suitors, or because their sperm are outnumbered when females do remate. We assessed the ability of fertile and sterile (irradiated) male Queensland fruit flies, Bactrocera tryoni ('Q-flies'), to have sperm stored by five sequential mates as well as the association between sperm depletion and female remating tendency. Sequential mates of fertile males stored similar numbers of sperm, indicating ample ability to replenish and maintain constant supplies between their once-daily mating opportunities. In contrast, sequential mates of sterile males stored progressively fewer sperm, with only trivial numbers of sperm stored by females mated by sterile males that had mated with two or more females previously. Despite the massive reduction in sperm storage by sequential mates of sterile males, fertile and sterile males were similar in their ability to induce sexual inhibition in their mates (to at least 30 days) and neither showed any decline in this ability across sequential matings. The ability of multiple-mated sterile males to induce sexual inhibition in their mates despite near or complete absence of sperm provides compelling evidence that sperm abundance plays no role in the induction of sexual inhibition in this species.

AB Conspecific cueing occurs when an organism receives information about habitat quality from the distribution of conspecifics. Consequently, animals should prefer to settle in habitats with high occupancy when conspecific cueing is used. Unlike salmonid fishes, which often acquire chemical recognition of natal streams in early life, sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, larvae produce a remarkably potent pheromone that migrating adults use to locate spawning streams. The size of the spawning migration in tributaries to the Great Lakes is correlated with the number of larvae resident to the stream, and therefore the amount of pheromone discharging into the lake. By releasing controlled amounts of larval odour into a lamprey-less stream, we tested the hypotheses that migrating sea lampreys ( 1) avoid swimming in waters that lack larval odour and ( 2) actively choose to swim in waters activated with the highest concentration of larval odour. Migrating sea lamprey clearly showed. ne-scale movements (<3 m) in streams to avoid swimming in waters that lacked larval odour. However, migrants only preferred intense odours after the difference in pheromone concentration reached an order of magnitude. These results suggest that the migratory pheromone functions primarily to establish the eligibility of a river for larval rearing and as a source of public information to indicate large differences in reproductive habitat quality to migrating adults.

AB To forage efficiently in a patchy environment animals must make informed decisions concerning in which patches to forage, for which the behaviour of other animals often provides informative cues. However, other individuals may differ in the quality or relevance of information that they provide, and accordingly animals are expected to be selective with respect to whom they copy. Such selectivity may include the biasing of copying towards older, larger or more experienced conspecifics. We investigated whether the ability of nine-spined sticklebacks, Pungitius pungitius, to exploit public information, that is, to judge the relative profitability of food patches solely on the basis of the relative feeding activity of others, is influenced by their own body size and that of the individuals from whom they copy. Individual observer fish, classed as either small or large, were trained that two discrete foraging patches differed in their relative quality, one being rich and the other poor ('personal information'). They then watched two shoals of either small or large demonstrator conspecifics feeding at the two patches ('public information'), but with relative profitability of the patches reversed compared to training, before being given the opportunity to make a patch choice. The effectiveness of this public demonstration was clearly contingent on the size of the demonstrators, with subjects of both size classes copying the patch choice of large demonstrators significantly more than they copied the patch choice of small demonstrators. This study reinforces the view that animal social learning is directed along particular pathways, with individuals predisposed by selection to copy particular categories of individual differentially.

AB Male wolf spiders (Lycosidae) in the genus Schizocosa vary in use of seismic and visual components of courtship display, ranging from unimodal (seismic only) to multimodal (seismic and visual). Studies show that variation in individual modes influences female receptivity, but responses to isolated signals may not be equivalent. To examine redundancy and interaction between modes, we compared female responses to isolated and combined courtship signals from males of two sympatric sibling species that differ in use of visual and seismic modes, S. ocreata and S. rovneri. Females of both species detected multimodal stimuli faster than visual or seismic cues alone, but they differed in responses to cues once they oriented. Female S. ocreata approached males performing isolated visual and seismic cues with equal frequency, but approached males performing multimodal cues more often. A greater proportion of female S. ocreata responded more receptively to multimodal cues than to seismic or visual cues alone, and showed higher rates of receptivity displays with multimodal cues. In contrast, female S. rovneri showed no differences in approaches, but responded more often and with higher display rates to seismic cues alone or multimodal cues, but not visual cues. These results suggest multimodal signalling increases detection of males by females, but that use of signal modes varies between even closely related sibling species. For S. rovneri, male signals in different modes are nonredundant, with seismic cues dominant over visual cues when presented alone or in multimodal signals. In contrast, for S. ocreata, male signals in different modes are redundant (eliciting the same responses from females with similar frequency), while the greatly increased responsiveness to multimodal signals indicates multiplicative enhancement.

AB Predator-elicited vocalizations are typically thought to function as alarms to conspecifics or as deterrents to predators. In splendid fairy-wrens, Malurus splendens, 'Type II song' is commonly elicited in response to vocalizations of the grey butcherbird, Cracticus torquatus, a potential predator of both nestlings and adults. We examined the context of Type II songs and investigated possible antipredator functions of this vocalization using mount presentations of predators at nests, playbacks of Type II songs to females in the field and playbacks of Type II songs to nestlings. Males did not give Type II songs in response to silent mount presentations of predators at the nest, females ignored Type II songs played in the field and nestlings ignored Type II songs played at the nest. Using playbacks of butcherbird calls to males in the presence of predator and nonpredator mounts, we found that males were not more likely to give Type II songs when a predator was near the nest. Despite being commonly uttered in response to predator calls, this vocalization does not appear to be an alarm or predator deterrent. We suggest that the song is a form of male advertisement.

ID GROUP DECISION-MAKING; SCOUTS GUIDE; FISH; MINORITY
AB When honeybee, Apis mellifera, swarms lift off to fly to their new nest site, only a small proportion of individuals know the location of the new site, yet these few individuals must guide the entire swarm to the correct place. How do scouts transfer directional information to their swarm-mates? The vision hypothesis proposes that scout bees fly rapidly through swarms 'pointing' in the direction of travel. We examined the vision hypothesis by exposing flying swarms to a large number of fast-moving bees headed in the wrong direction. These bees mimicked scouts and created conflicting directional information. Swarms that were exposed to conflicting information from fast-moving bees showed clear evidence of disrupted guidance including splitting and failure to reach the nest box. We discuss the implications of our findings for hypotheses about the mechanisms of swarm guidance, and for our knowledge of how collectively moving groups deal with conflicting information.

AB Coordinated vocal displays of cooperatively breeding animals provide a compelling model for investigating the opposing motivations for engaging in conflict versus cooperative behaviours. Hypotheses for the function of coordinated vocal displays differ with respect to these motivations and have been traditionally investigated by using playback to simulate varying degrees of threat to individuals and groups. We evaluated the function of coordinated vocal displays by presenting territorial groups of cooperatively breeding rufous-naped wrens, Campylorhynchus rufinucha, with three playback stimuli: solos, duets and choruses. We found that all groups responded strongly to playback by approaching the loudspeaker together, vocalizing, and performing visual displays. A composite playback response measure showed significantly more aggressive reactions to all playback treatments compared to a pre-playback control period, yet did not vary across solo, duet and chorus treatments. This suggests that the playback stimuli represented equally strong threats despite the varying numbers of contributors to each stimulus, and does not support the hypothesis that coordinated vocalizations are graded signals of threat in this species. Our findings stand in contrast to previous playback studies that have reported an increase in aggression with an increasing number of simulated intruders, or an increase in coordinated vocalizations in response to solo playback. We interpret the results of our study as evidence that coordinated vocalizations function in the cooperative behaviour of joint territory defence in the rufous-naped wren.

AB Extrapair paternity may create marked variation in the reproductive success of males and thus contribute to the evolution of sexually selected traits in socially monogamous mating systems. We examined the distribution of extrapair paternity in a passerine bird, the pied flycatcher, in relation to plumage coloration and male age. The frequency of extrapair paternity was found to be low in our study population in Southwest Finland (38 of 857 (4.4%) offspring in 25 of 191 (13%) broods). We were able to identify the sire for 53% of the extrapair young and in each case the extrapair sire was at least 2 years old. The probability of siring extrapair young was not associated with pigment-based brown-black dorsal plumage coloration, structural ultraviolet (UV) coloration or forehead patch size. The probability of being cuckolded, however, increased with decreasing UV chroma of the white wing patch. Our results thus indicate that there are multiple factors influencing when and with whom females engage in extrapair copulations. They also indicate that the male traits influencing the decision to cuckold the social mate are different from those used for choosing an extrapair mate.

AB Natural social communication in animals involves the use of multiple sensory channels but has traditionally been easier to study one channel at a time. As a consequence we know more about the simplified situation of unitary signal channels than we do about the natural situation in which these sources are integrated. Studies of single channels of communication underestimate, and can even misrepresent, the salience and meaning of messages that are normally communicated via multiple channels. However, new mechanical or robotic animal models allow us to test the meaning of multiple components of a signal, via multiple sensory channels. Being three-dimensional, they also allow these questions to be tested in natural field settings where ambient light may constrain other methods such as video playback. Robotic models have been successfully tested with wild amphibians, reptiles and birds. Here we show that a wild mammal, the eastern grey squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis, responds to a robotic model displaying alarm behaviour. Wild squirrels showed enhanced responses to multisensory, audio/visual signals of alarm compared to unisensory (either audio or visual) signals. This is significant for studies of the evolution of communication in that it underscores the importance of taking the complete signal into account, and it provides a method for studying multisensory communication in wild mammals. It is also important for studies of sensory integration, since the squirrels showed an enhanced behavioural response to multisensory signals, providing an overt parallel to brain mechanisms of other mammals that show neural enhancement to multisensory stimuli.

AB Honeybees and other insects departing from a newly discovered food source perform 'learning flights', which provide them with visual information that will guide their return. Previously, we showed that durations of learning flights are modulated in response to spatial uncertainty and profitability of a food source. Here, we examined whether longer learning flights allow bees to return to a goal with greater spatial accuracy. We found that longer learning flights performed at a new location increased the probability and accuracy of a bee's return to the departure point. After performing reorientation flights in response to uncertainty at a familiar location, bees continued to rely on previously learned information, but longer reorientation flights increased the likelihood that bees would use updated information acquired via reorientation flights. Longer reorientation flights performed in response to changes in the distribution and profitability of food within a familiar area decreased the likelihood that a bee would return to the departure point. These results suggest that longer learning flights have a greater influence on search than do shorter flights, but bees use the information obtained during the learning flights differently depending on the circumstances prompting the learning flights in the first place. Our studies reveal a richer picture of the function of learning flights than previously appreciated, and provide evidence of their role in the adaptive modi. cation of information gathering in response to ecological changes.

AB Dispersal is a common phenomenon in animals, with important consequences for individual fitness and the genetics and structure of populations. We studied the causes and consequences of breeding dispersal from an individual perspective using as a model organism the colonial lesser kestrel. For this purpose, we gathered information on 235 birds that attempted to breed in 2 consecutive years (2004-2006) in any of the 22 colonies monitored in the study area. Eighty-two per cent of kestrels returned to the same breeding colony where they had attempted to breed in the previous year. Probability of dispersal decreased with age and individual reproductive performance in the season previous to dispersal and females dispersed more frequently than males. Dispersers settled in colonies with a higher mean reproductive performance than other available colonies located around their colony of origin. However, the size of the colony selected did not differ between selected and surrounding colonies. Thus, dispersers selected highly productive rather than large colonies. Own body condition or the quality of the mates obtained (estimated by their pectoral thickness and size) did not change for individuals that dispersed or for philopatric individuals in subsequent seasons. Although dispersers greatly increased their own breeding performance after dispersal, it did not exceed that of their philopatric counterparts. These results help to explain the coexistence of dispersal and philopatric behaviours within a population and suggest that dispersal may be an adaptive behaviour that increases reproductive performance, particularly for individuals that have suffered a bad breeding experience.

AB When selecting retreat sites, rock-dwelling animals assess thermal and hydric properties of the rocks under which they shelter. Another obvious, but harder to measure, factor that may affect retreat site selection is the size and structure of the three-dimensional crevice beneath the rock. We developed a novel technique to quantify crevice structure beneath rocks and compared crevices used by snakes and lizards with unused crevices. Multiple attributes of crevice structure such as the height of the crevice above the substrate, the area of the crevice suitable for fitting the entire body of the animal, the degree of closure of the crevice and the amount of fragmentation within the crevice affected the suitability of a crevice as a retreat site. Therefore, crevice structural attributes, not simply size and thickness of the overlying rock, may be important factors driving retreat site selection by ectotherms. We also found that crevice structure directly alters thermal regimes, and may be more important than rock thickness in this respect. Understanding the characteristics of the space actually occupied by animals can yield a greater understanding of habitat selection, and our novel technique for quantifying crevice geometry should be readily transferable to other systems.

AB Seminal products transferred during copulation can have substantial effects on females, including accelerated oviposition, decreased mating receptivity and shorter life span. This study addresses two sets of hypotheses about ingested seminal products: (1) whether they act as nutrition or have effects like those of seminal proteins and (2) whether they harm females (implying sexual conflict). We studied the ladybird beetle Adalia bipunctata, the females of which consume a spermatophore after mating. To examine the effect of spermatophore feeding on short-term reproduction, we combined a spermatophore treatment (allowing or preventing ingestion) with a diet manipulation. If spermatophores serve only as food, then low-food females are expected to show the strongest response; if spermatophores contain signalling proteins, the effect should be of similar magnitude across food treatments. Feeding on a single spermatophore affected females in two ways. The 'allow' group oviposited significantly faster than the 'prevent' group, but this response was independent of female diet, suggesting that spermatophores act as signals rather than as nutrition. In a second experiment, spermatophore consumption increased female remating resistance. In a long-term experiment, the continued ingestion of multiple spermatophores had no detectable effect on female life span, lifetime reproductive success or lifetime remating behaviour. The absence of such costs does not support the hypothesis of sexual conflict over spermatophore ingestion. Overall, the results imply that spermatophores have a signalling function but provide little, if any, nutritional value or long-term effect on fitness. Direct evidence that spermatophore function is shaped by sexually antagonistic coevolution is still lacking. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Examination of the reproductive success of cooperative breeders can provide insights into costs and benefits of group living. We tested two hypotheses proposed to account for group living in prairie voles. One hypothesis suggests that ecological constraints such as the lack of available territories may cause delayed dispersal leading to formation of groups. The other hypothesis suggests that benefits of group living outweigh the benefits of dispersal. If the benefits of group living outweigh the costs, then per capita reproductive success should increase with increasing group size. If ecological constraints prevent dispersal, then lifetime reproductive success may not differ in groups of different sizes, or there may be an inverse relationship between per capita lifetime reproductive success and group size. We also investigated whether food supplementation (higher-quality habitat) and the number of breeding females per group influenced lifetime reproductive success. During two summers, we monitored reproductive success of food-supplemented and unsupplemented populations of prairie voles in 0.1 ha enclosures. Live trapping allowed us to identify residents of breeding units. We found that per capita reproductive success increased with group size in food-supplemented populations. This result was not due to the presence of additional breeding females since per capita production of offspring decreased in groups with larger numbers of breeding females. Thus, larger groups may benefit the breeding female, but the presence of additional breeding females per group appears costly. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When females mate multiply (polyandry), they create opportunities for competition among males for the fertilization of their eggs. Selection is expected to favour males capable of fathering more progeny under competition or males that can somehow induce females to refrain from multiply mating. Studies in Drosophila show that there is extensive variation in sperm competitive ability within populations and in adaptations to sperm competition between closely related species. Here we test differences in reproductive success when first or last to mate among Drosophila melanogaster males from strains of different geographical origin. Males from a Congo strain were weak sperm competitors when they were first or second to mate with females from an ebony strain. The weak sperm competitive ability of Congo males appears to be related to the quality of their sperm in female storage, but the effect was independent of female genotype. When Congo males mate first, they are capable of inducing higher female fidelity and egg laying than other males. However, egg-laying advantages are female dependant. These results suggest that males can evolve alternative adaptations to maximize their reproductive fitness, such as avoiding sperm competition through postcopulatory guarding (i. e. female fidelity) and inducing higher female reproductive investment (i. e. egg laying). Such adaptations are not necessarily transitive across competing males and females, which highlights the complexity of postmating reproductive adaptations in Drosophila.

AB This study investigated how variation in twilight duration affects the evening emergence of two species of fruit bat, the black flying-fox, Pteropus alecto, and the grey-headed flying-fox, Pteropus poliocephalus, from a mixed-species colony in New South Wales, Australia. Because there are threshold illuminances that accompany the onset and end of emergence activity, I predicted that the duration of the colonywide emergence should vary with twilight duration. Because the duration of twilight varies both with season and with latitude, emergence duration should vary correspondingly. As expected, emergence duration correlated with seasonal changes in twilight duration and was independent of meteorological and ecological variables. Furthermore, P. alecto showed a wider distribution of individual emergence times than P. poliocephalus, which corresponded with the different latitudinal distributions of the two species. This study shows that seasonal and latitudinal variation in activity timing in bats may merely be a by-product of the underlying circadian mechanism, which may confound studies that seek adaptive ecological explanations for inter- and intraspecific variation in the timing of activities around dawn and dusk.

AB Functional explanations of the dawn chorus in birds remain elusive. One hypothesis suggests that this acoustic display may play a role in female choice of extrapair males. Most young in cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wrens, Malurus cyaneus, are sired by extra-group males. Females initiate extra-group copulations exclusively through predawn forays to males singing in the dawn chorus. We measured variation between males in dawn singing at three levels of song production: song components, structured into songs, which make up recitals. We related this variation to independent measures of male quality and social status. Males sing two distinct categories of songs during the dawn chorus: a complex and variable chatter song and a more repeatable trill song. Dominant males with male subordinate helpers produced chatter songs at a greater rate than either dominant males without helpers or subordinates, suggesting a role in the competition between male group members. However, the trill song is implicated in female choice because older males sing songs with a longer trill component and have greater extrapair success, and trade-offs between phrases within the trill component imply constraints on the length of the trill component in entirety that could enforce honesty. The dawn chorus of the superb fairy-wren may thus have a duel role, involving enforcement of dominance among male group members (male-male competition), and signalling attractiveness to mates (female choice).

AB Aggressive interactions can play an important role in the reproduction of many species. Several factors ( e. g. resource value, asymmetries among contestants in fighting ability, and information asymmetry) influence the amount of aggression shown by individuals. In particular, it has been predicted that resident individuals, who presumably have more information about an area than nonresidents, will be more likely to win when the area contains resources of high value. Conversely, invaders, who have incomplete information about an area, should be more likely to win when the resource value is low. Male house crickets, Acheta domesticus, increase their aggressive behaviour in the presence of female chemical cues; thus, we manipulated the amount of chemical cues in a given area and who had information ( resident versus invader). Resident males were more aggressive and won more contests when there was a greater amount of female chemical cues. In addition, invader males were more likely to win contests under control conditions with no female cues. Our data suggest that information asymmetry can play an important role in the fighting decisions made by animals. Additionally, our data highlight the multimodal nature of communication in crickets.

AB Giving calls to alert conspecifics to the presence of food is widespread among mammals and birds. Although the circumstances affecting the function of food-associated calls have been well studied, data on how receivers come to associate these calls with food are lacking. Specifically, the possibility that individuals may be actively taught to associate certain vocalizations with food delivery has not been addressed. In pied babblers, Turdoides bicolor, adults often give purr calls when feeding young and offspring subsequently associate these calls with food delivery. We investigated how offspring come to associate purr calls with food, specifically addressing the question of whether adults teach nestlings to respond to these calls. Adults use purr calls only in the presence of offspring and purr-calling does not seem to result in immediate, direct benefits to adults. Rather, the function of purr-calling seems to be to promote offspring learning: experimental playbacks show that nestlings learn to respond to purr calls and that purr calls must be reliably paired with food delivery for learning to occur. By giving purr calls during feeding visits at the nest, adults apparently actively condition nestlings to associate these calls with food. This represents a novel form of teaching among nonhuman animals. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In social species, dominance relationships and access to food resources are often affected by asymmetries in resource-holding potential (RHP) between competitors of different age-sex classes with males usually being dominant and feeding first, followed by females and then juveniles. In this study we investigated how variables such as sex and age affected dominance rank and feeding order in a social group of feral domestic cats, Felis silvestris catus, a sexually dimorphic species in which males are larger than females and do not take part in parental care. Intersexual dominance relationships varied depending on the competitive context: males occupied top rank positions away from food, whereas females increased in rank at the expense of males in a feeding context. Around the age of 4-6 months, kittens were significantly more likely than adults of both sexes to be the first to feed, indicating that they received a certain level of tolerance. These results provide support for game-theory models predicting conflict outcome in favour of the smaller competitor when asymmetries in both the value of winning and in the cost of winning inappropriately may compensate for the smaller competitor's lower RHP. It is suggested that the results are not an artifact of domestication: unlike male lions, Panthera leo, which usually dominate both females and cubs at kills, male domestic cats may value the food less than females and juveniles, because they do not need to maintain constantly a peak physical condition to defend a group of females and protect offspring from infanticide.

AB Fish acanthocephalans can modify the antipredator behaviour of their intermediate hosts in response to cues from fish predators. However, it is still unclear whether such behavioural changes are adaptive, or are just the consequence of infection. We addressed this question through studying two acanthocephalans, Pomphorhynchus laevis and Polymorphus minutus, and their intermediate host, the amphipod Gammarus pulex. Pomphorhynchus laevis completes its cycle in a freshwater fish, whereas P. minutus exploits waterbirds as final hosts. We first assessed vulnerability of infected and uninfected gammarids to predation by bullheads, Cottus gobio. Pomphorhynchus laevis-infected gammarids were more susceptible to predation than uninfected ones when a refuge was available, whereas no selective predation on P. minutus-infected individuals was recorded, independently of refuge availability. We then quantified refuge use when a bullhead was present in an enclosure or when the enclosure was empty. Individuals of each group significantly increased refuge use in the presence of a bullhead. However, a larger proportion of P. laevis-infected gammarids remained out of the refuge in the presence of a predator, compared with uninfected controls, whereas no such effect was observed in P. minutus-infected ones. Finally, we assessed reaction to bullhead olfactory cues, using a Y-maze apparatus. Pomphorhynchus laevis-infected gammarids spent significantly more time in the predator-scented arm, whereas the reverse was observed in uninfected ones. Polymorphus minutus-infected individuals, however, did not differ from uninfected controls. We discuss our results in relation with the adaptiveness of host manipulation by parasites.

AB Finding reliable ways of assessing female mate choice is an essential prerequisite to understanding variation in female preferences and its impact on sexual selection. The zebra finch, Taeniopgyia guttata, is a classic avian model species for investigating mate choice and sexual selection, but to date virtually all work has been carried out using domesticated birds, and there are inconsistencies in the findings between studies. We tested three different methods for measuring female preferences in this species using both wild and domesticated birds. The first method was a traditional two-way mate choice chamber, where we measured the time spent with each male. The second method was a no-choice chamber where a single male and female were placed in the same cage for 5 min, such that the pair could physically interact, and the female's sexual response was recorded. The third method was an aviary set-up, comprising eight birds (four males and four females), and we recorded the number of pair-bonding behaviours observed over a 24-h period. In the aviary, we found that birds formed pair bonds almost exclusively with their own type (wild males paired with wild females, and domestic males paired with domestic females). In the two-way choice chamber, this assortative mating preference was only shown by domestic females, and in the no-choice test, only wild females showed this assortative mating preference. We discuss the possible reasons for these differences between mate choice tests and make recommendations for future studies on mate choice. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Status-dependent tactics of males trying to gain access to females were examined in relation to morphology, male-male interactions and dispersal in a sap beetle, Librodor japonicus. Males of this species have sexually dimorphic enlarged mandibles which they use in fights for mates on a sap site. Morphological analyses revealed a switchpoint at which the linear slopes of mandible and hindwing width to body length increased and decreased, respectively. Larger males frequently fought with other males in an experimental arena, whereas smaller males often showed sneaking behaviour without fighting. Mark-release-recapture experiments showed a size-dependent difference in dispersal ability of males in the field. The longest dispersal distance was seen in intermediate-sized males, and the shortest dispersal distances were observed in the largest and smallest males. In females, no relation was found between body size and dispersal distance. The largest males thus remain on sap sites and fought with other males, the smallest males also remain on sap sites and try to sneak access to females, and intermediate-sized males move among sap sites and settle on one without a larger male. The results suggest a nondichotomous difference in optimal behavioural tactics of males even though male dimorphism has been detected in armed beetles.

AB Cerebral lateralization refers to the lateralized partitioning of cognitive function in either hemisphere of the brain. Using a standard detour test, we investigated lateralized behaviour in wild-caught, female poeciliid fish, Brachyraphis (=Brachyrhaphis) episcopi, from high- and low-predation areas. Wild fish were bred and their offspring reared under controlled laboratory conditions. These laboratory-reared fish were screened in the same laterality assays as their parents. We observed differences between wild-caught females and their laboratory-reared female offspring in the pattern of lateralization (tendency to use one hemisphere over the other to process information). Conversely, the strength of lateralization (consistency of hemispherical bias) was largely conserved between generations, consistent with it being a heritable character. Both wild-caught females from high-predation sites and their laboratory-reared offspring showed stronger lateralized behaviour than their counterparts from low-predation sites. This difference in strength of lateralization is likely to provide fitness benefits to fish that occur in high-predation areas by enabling them to school and watch for predators simultaneously (dual processing). We hypothesized that the differences in the pattern of lateralization observed between species, and populations within species, are due to the manner in which they perceive and classify stimuli in the world around them. In particular, the perceived emotive content or context of a scene is likely to vary between individuals that have had different life experiences.

AB Sleep appears to effect some sort of neural maintenance, but a complete theory of the function of sleep must address why such maintenance requires a behavioural shutdown (or unconsciousness) that leaves an animal vulnerable to predators. We present a simple, strategic model to determine the degree of sleep that minimizes the risk of predation. We assume that the brain is composed of neural units that can, in theory, 'sleep' independently of each other, and that a given neural unit must go offline for maintenance/sleep. We also assume that the probability of detecting an attack depends on the fraction of neural units that are awake. We found that having all neural units offline simultaneously (i.e. shutdown sleep) is often the safest way to perform neural maintenance, even though partial sleep makes predators more detectable. This counterintuitive result reflects the assumptions that, in a state of partial sleep, (1) neural maintenance takes longer to complete and (2) predator detection is less effective than suggested by the proportion of neural units online. Partial sleep is a possible outcome when the risk of attack increases as more neural units are taken offline. Minimal sleep (with only one or a few units offline) is a possible outcome when the attack rate while awake is substantially higher than when asleep. Partial sleep of a sort is known to occur in some animals, but there is no apparent evidence for the idea of minimal sleep.

AB For most species that have been studied, considerable variation exists in male postcopulatory reproductive success, including female sperm use, reproductive investment and remating patterns. We investigated postcopulatory sexual selection in the beetle Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) by examining the correlation of two measures of a male's success (proportion of eggs fertilized (P-2) and number of eggs that a female laid after mating with him) with male body size, copulatory behaviour and copula duration. We allowed each female to mate with an irradiated sterile male and a normal male. Relative duration of intromission (i.e. the difference in the intromission durations of the two males) and relative stroking rate, but not the absolute duration and stroking rate, were positively correlated with P2. The number of eggs that a female laid was negatively related to the thrusting rate of her mate. Irradiated males mated for a shorter duration and thrusted at a lower rate than normal males. Irradiated males also fertilized a lower proportion of eggs than normal males, and females were more likely to remate after mating with an irradiated mate than after mating with a normal male. These findings suggest that behavioural traits may influence male postcopulatory reproductive success. Furthermore, since variation in male stroking rate and intromission duration are associated with variation in male fertilization success, these traits may have evolved through postcopulatory sexual selection.

AB Territorial animals typically have the ability to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics. This enables residents to minimize the costs of resource defence by matching the intensity of their aggressive response to the level of threat posed by intruders. Although individual discrimination based upon chemical signals is well established in lizards, much less is known about the role of visual cues, despite the importance of this modality in social interactions. We conducted two series of video playback experiments, modelled on a habituation-dishabituation design, to test for visually mediated individual discrimination in an Australian agamid lizard. Captive males were shown a different digital video sequence of the same life-sized conspecific every day for 4 days. They were then tested in probe trials with either a novel sequence of the same male, or a matched sequence of a different male. One such series was conducted with footage of inactive basking lizards to evaluate the role of static morphological cues, while the other presented displaying males so that signal structure was also available. Lizards responded to a change in the identity of both static and displaying video males with increased substrate licking, a chemosensory behaviour that has consistently been reported in previous work with live opponents. The unfamiliar basking conspecific also evoked increased locomotor activity. These results show that Jacky dragons are capable of discriminating between familiar and unfamiliar intruders based upon static morphological cues alone.

AB Mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus, females actively defend fawns against predators, including nonoffspring conspecific fawns and heterospecific white-tailed deer, O. virginianus, fawns. We hypothesized that the defence of nonoffspring fawns was due to a recognition error. During a predator attack, females may have to decide whether to defend a fawn with imperfect information on its identity obtained from hearing only a few distress calls. We examined fawn distress calls to determine whether calls made by the two species and by different individuals within each species were acoustically distinctive. The mean and maximum fundamental frequencies of mule deer fawns were nearly double those of white-tailed deer fawns, with no overlap, enabling us to classify 100% of calls to the correct species using a single trait. A large proportion of calls was also assigned to the correct individual using a multivariate analysis (66% and 70% of mule deer and white-tailed deer fawns, respectively, chance = 6% and 10%); however, there was considerable statistical uncertainty in the probability of correct classification. We observed fawns approach conspecific females in an attempt to nurse; females probed most offspring fawns with their noses before accepting them, and always probed nonoffspring fawns before rejecting them, suggesting that close contact and olfactory information were needed to unequivocally distinguish nonoffspring from offspring fawns. Taken together, these results suggest that acoustic variation alone would probably be sufficient to permit rapid and reliable species discrimination, but it may not be sufficient for mothers to unequivocally distinguish their own fawn from conspecific fawns.

AB Web-building spiders are territorial animals whose webs serve several purposes including foraging, reproduction and protection. Two factors are predicted to be of primary importance in determining a spider's web-building strategy: (1) current nutritional state (a function of prior feeding rate), which determines the net value of a web, and (2) the presence of co-occurring spiders with whom it may have to interact and partition resources. I conducted a laboratory experiment to test whether western black widow spiders, Latrodectus hesperus, express state-dependent web-building strategies that vary with the presence of conspecific or heterospecific (Tegenaria agrestis and T. duellica) spiders in a microhabitat. I maintained L. hesperus females on two different diets (high- versus low-food) and tested their web-building behaviour in the presence or absence of neighbours. When sharing a microhabitat with con- or heterospecific spiders, L. hesperus increased their web-building investment by producing higher-density webs containing more silk and by initiating web-building sooner. Web building was further influenced by nutritional state, such that well-fed spiders produced more silk and built denser webs than their poorly fed counterparts. Furthermore, microhabitat occupancy level and nutritional state showed a combined effect on the different components of web-building behaviour in L. hesperus. I discuss how this behavioural plasticity might optimize microhabitat settlement investments in the context of constraints on web-building activities imposed by nutritional state and cohabitation.

AB We investigated differences in aggression between wild-type Betta splendens, Betta smaragalina, two domesticated strains of B. splendens selectively bred for cockfight-like contests and appearance, and Betta sp. mahachai, an unclassified Betta variety. We tested the fish for aggression once they reached sexual maturity as well as during adulthood. We used a combined mirror and video playback test and a mutual-viewing test to measure close-range gill extension and biting attempts as principal measures of aggression. As predicted, the short-finned domesticated strains were significantly more aggressive than wild-type B. splendens. However, the difference in aggression manifested itself only in the mutual-viewing test, which is the test that most closely resembled an actual fight. Betta splendens and the closely related B. smaragdina did not differ in aggression across the experimental contexts; however, B. sp. mahachai responded more aggressively to the combined mirror/video test than B. splendens. Four of the five groups of fighting fish tested responded significantly more aggressively to video images of an aggressive conspecific male than to blank screen controls, suggesting that video playback can be a useful tool for measuring aggression in fighting fish. Our results are relevant for improving our understanding of key aspects of territorial aggression in teleost fish as well as for developing the most reliable ways of measuring them.

AB In social mammals, grooming may be used in care of offspring, to maintain pair bonds, or to placate dominant individuals. We examined grooming patterns in groups of the cooperatively breeding meerkat, Suricata suricatta. Dominant females produce over 80% of litters, but older subordinate females occasionally breed. Grooming between dominant individuals was the most common and symmetrical interaction. The dominant female received more and gave less in grooming interactions with subordinates. The dominant female groomed younger subordinates more frequently than older subordinates, suggesting that grooming by dominant females represents parental care, and also reflects the reproductive conflict between females. Older subordinates groomed the dominant female more frequently than did younger subordinates. Subordinates that were frequently attacked by the dominant female groomed her for longer durations than those that were not, and the duration of dominant female grooming by subordinates increased as birth of the dominant female's pups approached. These results support the idea that subordinates use grooming to placate the dominant female. Analysis of 'immediate reciprocity' (whether the groomee returned grooming of the groomer within the grooming bout) showed that subordinate females reciprocated more frequently than subordinate males when the dominant female initiated grooming. However, the dominant female reciprocated subordinate females less frequently than she did subordinate males. This suggests that the need to placate the dominant female may be higher for subordinate females than for subordinate males, possibly because of the risk of eviction caused by reproductive conflict between females.

AB Nearly all studies of Drosophila melanogaster courtship have focused exclusively on male behaviour. Female precopulatory behaviour is often relegated to 'accept' or 'reject' mating, and how female behaviour interacts with that of males remains largely unknown. Using a video-computing approach, we measured 10 behavioural states and 22 elementary behaviours that occur during the precopulatory phase of Canton-S (Cs) flies. Male and female behaviours were studied under a variety of social conditions. This allowed us to identify which one(s) is relevant to courtship or to general activity. Our analysis showed that the courtship repertoire was not constant over time, as female and male behaviours varied during courtship, and that virgin Cs females showed several behavioural sequences whose frequency, latency and total duration could predict their mating success. The most striking index of females' willingness to copulate was the way they extruded the ovipositor: a partial extrusion stimulated male courtship, whereas total extrusion inhibited it. Furthermore, females that mated preened their abdomen more frequently than did females that did not mate. We also observed that male sexual activity was strongly increased when the female emitted a tiny volatile droplet at the tip of the ovipositor. We hypothesized that partial ovipositor extrusion, droplet emission and abdominal preening are related behaviours that result in the active dispersion of compounds spread on the female's abdomen. Such a detailed picture of the precopulatory behaviours should allow better characterization of the sensory stimuli exchanged during courtship in Drosophila.

TI Effects of manipulated aggressive 'interactions' on bystanding male
   fighting fish, <i>Betta splendens</i>
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION; MOTIVATION
AB Aggressive interactions between animals often take place in a social environment. Third parties not involved in those interactions, bystanders, have the opportunity to extract information from such interactions and such information may direct their future behaviour towards the interactants. Studies of fish and songbirds have shown that individuals are capable of extracting information in this way. In songbirds, acoustic playback affords a degree of control that allows the nature of information extracted from interactions to be more easily determined; studies of fish have relied upon naturally occurring differences between observed interactants and have therefore lacked this degree of control. We allowed bystanding male fighting fish to observe two male conspecifics that appeared to be interacting, but in reality the two males were displaying to mirrors. The apparent interactions were manipulated so as to increase or decrease the aggression of one 'interactant' while leaving that of the other male constant. When subsequently introduced to the 'interactants' individually, bystanders responded more strongly to males whose opponents' aggression had been decreased and to the winners of control trials, but failed to distinguish winners from losers when the aggression of one male was increased. Analysis of the behaviour of 'interactants' suggests that bystanders either cannot or do not distinguish between winners and losers when the overall level of direct aggression in interactions is high. Our result may explain why individuals are often observed to escalate fights even though other predictors of outcome show that they will not be successful.

AB Animal fights are typically preceded by displays and there is debate whether these are always honest. We investigated the prefight period in hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, during which up to four types of display plus other activities that might provide information are performed. We determined how each display influences or predicts various fight decisions, and related these displays to the motivational state of the attacker, as determined by a startle response, and of the motivational state of the defender, as determined by the duration for which it resisted eviction from its shell. Two displays appeared to have consistent but different effects. Cheliped presentation, where the claws were held in a stationary position, often by both crabs but for longer by the larger, seemed to be honest, and allowed for mutual size assessment. This display enhanced the motivation and the success of the larger crab. In contrast, cheliped extension, involving the rapid thrust of the open chelae towards the opponent, did not seem to allow for mutual size assessment and may contain an element of bluff. It was performed more by the smaller crab and enhanced its success. The complexity of displays in this species appears to allow for both honesty and manipulation.

AB Theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that an increase in flight costs will decrease flight performance, and that birds should trade-off the benefits of body reserves to minimize these costs. Alternatively, birds could avoid starvation by increasing food intake, thereby maintaining body reserves, and/or decreasing flight activity to compensate for the greater per unit flight costs. To test the effect of increased flight costs on body mass regulation and on flying and feeding activity, we experimentally manipulated wing area in a free-ranging wintering population of coal tits, Periparus ater, and in captive birds living in a less restrictive environment (large outdoor aviaries). In the field, body mass decreased when wing area was reduced, but heavier birds lost more weight than lighter birds as a consequence of an allometric increase in flying costs. However, wing area reduction had no effect on body mass in the aviaries. Birds also flew less when wing area was reduced and those with higher wing loadings decreased flying frequency more markedly. We suggest that the goal of small resident birds living in a Mediterranean montane climate would be to maintain daily fat reserves within narrow limits during autumn and winter, even under contrasting ecological conditions. 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The cooperative abilities of captive chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, in experiments do not match the sophistication that might be predicted based on their naturally occurring cooperative behaviours. This discrepancy might partly be because in previous experiments potential chimpanzee cooperators were partnered without regard to their social relationship. We investigated the ability of chimpanzee dyads to solve a physical task cooperatively in relation to their interindividual tolerance levels. Pairs that were most capable of sharing food outside the test were also able to cooperate spontaneously (by simultaneously pulling two ropes) to obtain food. In contrast, pairs that were less inclined to share food outside of the test were unlikely to cooperate. Furthermore, previously successful subjects stopped cooperating when paired with a less tolerant partner, even when the food rewards were presented in a dispersed and divisible form to reduce competition between subjects. These results show that although chimpanzees are capable of spontaneous cooperation in a novel instrumental task, tolerance acts as a constraint on their ability to solve such cooperative problems. This finding highlights the importance of controlling such social constraints in future experiments on chimpanzee cooperation, and suggests that the evolution of human-like cooperative skills might have been preceded by the evolution of a more egalitarian social system and a more human-like temperament.

AB To assess evidence of the ability of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, to recognize the rank and kin relationships of other individuals, we analysed the recruitment of allies in the context of agonistic confrontations. Both mature and immature macaques preferentially directed their recruitment attempts to individuals ranking higher than their opponent and to individuals that were not the kin of their opponent. They were also able to combine the two criteria. These results suggest that Japanese macaques can recognize third-party rank and kin relationships, and provide observational evidence supporting the notion that nonhuman primates can simultaneously use multiple criteria in classifying the social relationships between group companions.

AB People learn to take aspirin for headaches, antacids for stomach aches and ibuprofen to relieve pain, and often obtain prescriptions from doctors for medications. Is it also possible that herbivores write their own prescriptions? From prehistoric times, people have looked to the presumed self-medicative behaviour of animals for remedies of ailments but it is still not clear whether animals seek medicinal compounds to recuperate from illness. Evidence of self-medication is based almost exclusively on observations rather than experimental analyses. We examined whether lambs select specific protective chemicals to recuperate from ingesting malaise-inducing foods. In pen studies, lambs in a treatment group were conditioned to consume foods and toxins (grain, tannins, oxalic acid) that led to negative internal states and then allowed to eat a substance known to attenuate each state (sodium bentonite, polyethylene glycol and dicalcium phosphate, respectively). Control lambs ate the same foods and medicines, but disassociated temporally, so they did not recuperate from illness. After conditioning, lambs ingested grain or food with tannins or oxalates and then received a choice of the three medicines. Only the treatment animals preferred to eat the specific compound known to rectify the state of malaise induced by the food previously ingested. Control animals never changed their pattern of use of the medicines, regardless of the food consumed before the choice. This first demonstration of multiple malaise-medicine associations supports suppositions in zoopharmacognosy and current hypotheses of homeostatic endeavour, and has implications for the well-being of wild and domestic animals.

AB To understand the mechanisms underlying the flow of social information in foraging groups, it is important to manipulate the behaviour of individuals and study the responses of flock members under different ecological and social conditions. Some studies have attempted this using three-dimensional models, like robots. Our goal was to assess the foraging and scanning behaviour of adult house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus, in response to robots mimicking different types of behaviours in artificial flocks (three linearly placed enclosures, with robots at the periphery and a live animal at the centre). We recorded whether live animals reacted to (1) the presence/absence of robots, (2) the motion of robots in relation to static robots, (3) variations in the type of robot behaviour and (4) the direction of the responses (increasing or decreasing their foraging effort). Adult house finches reacted differently to the presence, motion and behaviour of robots, and they spent more time foraging and less time scanning, which led to increasing seed intake, as the robots simulated body movement that could be associated with successful foraging behaviour (more handling time) or antipredator behaviour. Responses to robots were similar to those given to live conspecifics. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of using robots in social foraging research and conclude that robots are suitable to test some hypotheses on the foraging and antipredator behaviour of flocks.

AB Male crab spiders locate cryptic females by methods that have proved elusive to researchers. Previous work has suggested that female draglines provide males with clues to the presence of females. Unlike other wandering spiders, however, M. vatia do not deposit mate-attracting pheromones on their draglines. Based on evidence that the size and strength of draglines vary predictably with the age and sex of the source spider, we tested the hypothesis that mechanical cues allow males to identify the age, sex and species of the dragline producer. We ran adult and penultimate male crab spiders through a series of trials to identify preferences for following different types of dragline. A spider's developmental stage influenced its response to draglines of other individuals, suggesting that these responses were influenced by the search for mates. Adult males preferred adult and juvenile female draglines and selected conspecific adult female draglines over draglines from adult females of a related species. Penultimate males did not show significant preferences in these tests. Mechanical cues may therefore moderate the responses of the adult males to foreign draglines. We consider dragline following in M. vatia as a model of how cues produced in a nonmating context may facilitate mate search, and we suggest that study of such species-specific environmental modifications may shed insight into the evolution of mate location systems.

   DYNAMICS; FISH; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; GROWTH; COSTS
AB Sexual conflict occurs when individuals of one sex express traits that reduce the fitness of individuals of the other sex. In many poeciliid fish, males harass females for copulations, which is thought to reduce female fitness by lowering foraging efficiency and increasing predation risk, energetic expenditure and the likelihood of disease transmission. Mating may also be costly for males, who often engage in aggressive interactions with other males in addition to expending energy pursuing females. We examined the effects of three operational sex ratios on male behaviour, female fitness and male body condition in the western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, during a 10-week experiment. Despite a significant reduction in male harassment, female growth and reproductive success decreased as the proportion of females increased. Results suggest that increases in female density had a strong, negative effect on female fitness, overwhelming any potential costs of male harassment. Aggressive behaviour between males increased and male copulation rate decreased as the proportion of males increased, suggesting that operational sex ratio influences the number of copulations that a male attempts by altering the frequency of agonistic interactions with other males and the number of females available to mate. We did not detect a difference in male body condition between treatments. Sources of female density dependence and consequences of variation in operational sex ratio on male fitness are discussed.

AB Many host species accept the costs of avian brood parasitism even though rejection appears to be the adaptive response. Acceptance is often attributed to an evolutionary lag in the appearance of rejection behaviour. Alternatively, the evolutionary equilibrium hypothesis explains acceptance as adaptive because the costs of rejection outweigh those of acceptance. Equilibrium assumes that bill size limits small hosts to more costly rejection methods, such as puncture-ejecting parasitic eggs. We tested whether warbling vireos, Vireo gilvus, and Baltimore orioles, Icterus galbula, the smallest puncture-ejecters of brown-headed cow-bird, Molothrus ater, eggs, are capable of grasp-ejection by using solid, plaster cowbird eggs and video analysis. We also tested whether the depth of oriole nests prevents grasp-ejection. Vireos ejected significantly more plaster eggs than did orioles. Most (91%) plaster eggs were ejected by vireos with no cost and grasp-ejection was confirmed, indicating that bill size does not constrain grasp-ejection. The grasp index of warbling vireos was at least 33% smaller than that of previously known grasp-ejecters. Thus, many species should be capable of grasp-ejection, which indirectly supports evolutionary lag. Orioles ejected an intermediate proportion (45%) of plaster eggs and ejection method was not confirmed. Nest depth was not supported as an explanation for acceptance by orioles. Because a few large and small ejecters of cowbird eggs appear to use both grasp- and puncture-ejection, we suggest that puncture-ejection may have evolved first, representing an initial selection pressure for cowbird eggshell strength.

AB For prey species, the costs associated with antipredator behaviours should drive the development of efficient risk assessment systems. According to the threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis, prey match the intensity of their antipredator responses with the degree of threat posed. Evidence of threat sensitivity exists for a variety of taxa, but little is known about how such responses develop. We investigated the effect of multiple conditioning events on the development of threat-sensitive antipredator responses of fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas. In experiment 1, we conditioned predator-naive minnows with brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis, odour paired with either a high or low concentration of conspecific alarm cues. Fish were conditioned twice (low/low, low/high, high/low, high/high), then tested for learned recognition of charr odour alone. Results suggest that minnows learn the relative risk associated with the predator based on the highest alarm cue concentration experienced during the conditioning trials. In experiment 2, predator-naive minnows were conditioned six times with charr odour paired with either a high or low concentration of alarm cues (6 low, 5 low/1 high, 1 high/5 low, 6 high). The intensity of the minnows' antipredator response to charr odour was not an averaging of the intensity of responses during the six conditioning trials. Instead, they used their last conditioning experience to adjust the intensity of their response to the predation cues. Predation fluctuates in space and time. Thus, the best way to adaptively respond to predator cues is to constantly update information regarding the relative risk associated with a given predator.

   crypsis to prey?
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The foraging strategies of wading birds may be influenced by their degree of crypsis to aquatic prey. White plumage has been hypothesized to be adaptive for herons hunting in open water habitats. We tested this hypothesis with laboratory and field experiments with multiple prey species. We investigated the response of crayfish, Procambarus spp., and mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, to white- and dark-plumaged birds in an experimental chamber. We compared the time spent by a prey in front of a snowy egret, Egretta thula, mount, little blue heron, E. caerulea, mount, and a control (dowel) with and without backdrop vegetation. Mosquitofish tended to spend less time under the little blue heron mount with no backdrop present but made no observable response to either plumage colour against a vegetative backdrop. We assessed prey response in the field using three drop traps. Each trap had either a little blue heron mount, a snowy egret mount or a control (dowel) mounted underneath a trap. We compared the amount of biomass captured between treatments. More prey biomass (mosquitofish, crayfish and anurans) was captured under the control and snowy egret treatments than under the little blue heron treatment. Our results suggest that dark plumage may be a disadvantage to herons foraging in open water. In vegetation, structural complexity of the habitat appears to nullify differences in plumage colour between white and dark foraging herons.

   SEXUAL SELECTION; HATCHING FAILURE; HETEROZYGOSITY; CHOICE; QUALITY;

AB Why females mate with multiple males, particularly in socially monogamous species, is one of the central unanswered questions in sexual selection and behavioural ecology. Recent theory suggests that socially monogamous females may improve the genetic quality of their offspring by mating with extrapair males with whom they are more genetically dissimilar (relative to their social mates), because decreased genetic similarity between mates may lead to decreased inbreeding depression of offspring and other benefits. We found that levels of extrapair paternity in splendid fairy-wren, Malurus splendens, broods were predicted by genetic similarity between social mates. Females whose entire broods were sired by extrapair males were more genetically similar to their social mates than they were to their extrapair mates, but females were no less similar to their extrapair mates than they were to the average male from the population. Within-pair young (WPY) from mixed-paternity broods showed higher levels of inbreeding and lower heterozygosity than did their extrapair nestmates or WPY from broods without extrapair paternity. Several processes could account for these patterns, including female choice of genetically dissimilar mates, differential sperm investment by males or differential survival of embryos as a function of genetic dissimilarity between mates, or postcopulatory processes such as sperm competition, cryptic female choice, or interactions between sperm and ova. Regardless of the mechanism, our results suggest that female splendid fairy-wrens may indirectly benefit from extrapair mating because it leads to lower levels of inbreeding and increased heterozygosity in their offspring.

AB Mating system theory predicts that differences between the sexes in potential reproductive rate and an operational sex ratio skewed strongly towards males should result in intense male competition, polygynous mating and high variance in male reproductive success. Accordingly, humpback whales are thought to be polygynous with differences in reproduction among males related to alternative mating tactics. However, there is currently a lack of data on male reproductive success. We tested predictions regarding male reproductive success in humpback whales using molecular assessment of paternity in a population in the Mexican Pacific. Parentage analysis was conducted for 125 mother-calf pairs and a sample of 297 males using 13 microsatellite loci. Two separate analyses were conducted, based upon conservative and relaxed criteria for the assignment of paternity. In the conservative analysis, 40 paternities (32.5% of tested calves) were assigned among 33 males, whereas in the relaxed analysis, 62 paternities (49.6% of calves) were assigned among 51 males. Regardless of analysis, the distribution of male reproductive success deviated from a random mating model, with significantly larger than expected variance (conservative, P = 0.011; relaxed, P = 0.022), and significantly more than expected males siring three calves (conservative, P = 0.021; relaxed, P = 0.011). However, most successful males sired only one calf and no male was assigned more than three calves, so reproductive skew was not severe. Therefore we conclude that this population has a polygynous mating system, but without the large variation in male reproductive success expected by apparent skew in the operational sex ratio and degree of male competition for mates.

TI Honeybee swarms: how do scouts guide a swarm of uninformed bees?
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID NEST-SITE SELECTION; SOCIAL INSECTS; ORIENTATION; PHEROMONES
AB The organized movement of a swarm of honeybees towards its new home is a perplexing phenomenon because only a small number of scout bees, approximately 5%, know the direction in which the swarm has to move. Nevertheless, in the majority of cases a swarm, comprising about 10 000 mainly uninformed bees, reaches the new home. How do the scouts transfer directional information en route to the uninformed bees? We investigated a hypothesis proposed in the 1950s that suggests that scout bees fly rapidly through the airborne swarm, pointing towards the new home. We developed a model that simulates the movement of swarms and scouts and showed that when scouts fly through the swarm at a speed slightly higher than the speed of the other (uninformed) bees, they are indeed able to direct the swarm towards its new home. Hence, our model strongly supports the proposed hypothesis and shows that a collection of uninformed bees can be successfully guided by the purposeful movements of a small number of informed scouts.

AB Long-term field studies conducted in Arizona show that two species of sympatric rattlesnakes differ in the structure of their mating systems, primarily in frequency and timing of mating seasons, despite exposure to identical environmental conditions. The western diamond-backed rattlesnake, Crotalus atrox, has two distinct mating seasons within a single annual spermatogenic cycle. The first mating season occurs from late August to early October. Following a hibernation period of 4 months, the second mating season occurs from mid-March to early May. Because there is a mating season in spring, long-term sperm storage by females during winter is facultative. In contrast, the black-tailed rattlesnake, Crotalus molossus, has a single mating season (mid-July to early September) within a single annual spermatogenic cycle. Due to the absence of a mating season in spring, long-term sperm storage by females during winter is obligatory. In both species, ovulation and fertilization occur in spring, and offspring are produced from mid-July to early September. Based on these robust data, we tested the hypotheses that seasonal patterns of plasma sex steroids (testosterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, and 17 P-estradiol) differ between males in wild populations of C. atrox and C. molossus, and that peak levels would be coincident with the mating seasons. Specifically, we predicted that there would be two peaks of sex steroids in C. atrox and one peak in C. molossus, and that baseline levels would be detected outside the periods of mating and spermatogenesis. Our results supported these predictions. Furthermore, absolute concentrations of plasma testosterone and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, but not 17 beta-estradiol, were higher in C. atrox than in C. molossus. We discuss a possible scenario for the evolution of the different mating seasons in these sympatric rattlesnakes, and advocate that comparative approaches to address such questions should integrate proximate and ultimate causation to increase explanatory power.

AB Although the capacity to learn how to manipulate flowers plays an integral role in the foraging of bumblebees, little is known about the effects of parasitic infection on the motor learning and memory of host bees. In the laboratory experiment reported here, we examined whether infection by the intestinal protozoan Crithidia bombi affected the ability of bumblebees, Bombus impatiens, to learn the specialized motor pattern required to handle a novel flower type. Using videotaped records of foraging behaviour, we related the motor performance of bees to the intensity of C. bombi infection. Low intensities of infection had no effect on the ability of bees to learn a novel flower-handling method; however, a high intensity of infection significantly reduced both motor-learning rate and maximum handling proficiency. In addition, highly infected bees showed a 200% increase in the amount of time and the number of visits required to learn how to manipulate flowers. These results indicate that C. bombi can influence the foraging behaviour of host bumblebees in subtle but ecologically significant ways. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID PARUS-MAJOR; VOCAL INTERACTIONS; INFORMATION; SIGNAL
AB Eavesdropping involves the extraction of information from signalling interactions by individuals not directly involved. Such behaviour has been conclusively demonstrated by experiments that present songbirds with simulated singing interactions in which the roles of interactants were varied by changing the timing of songs. We examined the phenomenon of song type matching by presenting male great tits, Pants major, with simulated interactions in which one interactant switched song type such that it matched (or not) that sung by the opponent. Subjects responded to simulated intrusion by previously heard interactants by singing significantly shorter songs in response to males that switched (i.e. used two song types), regardless of whether or not matching occurred, compared with those that used one. Subjects also showed a significantly lower level of approach behaviour to males whose opponents had switched song types but not matched. Male great tits are therefore capable of extracting different kinds of information by eavesdropping on interactions between others and using that information when deciding how to respond to subsequent intrusion. These results confirm and expand our knowledge on the potential of eavesdropping to provide accurate information on the likely strengths and weaknesses of potential rivals.

AB Blue whales, Balaenoptera musculus, in northeast Pacific waters often produce a two-part call. The first part, A, is amplitude-modulated, lasting about 17 s, and the second part, B, is frequency-modulated, lasting about 19 s. Type B calls are more easily detected in recordings and are often the signal tracked in long-term monitoring. Automatic detection methods applied to data from a hydrophone moored at 8 degrees N, 95 degrees W in the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) from 15 May 1996 to 15 May 1997 showed seasonal variability in call detection. Calls were detected most often from February to June. Blue whales are believed to use the ETP region as a wintering ground but probably also feed there. Blue whales forage primarily on krill that undertake diel vertical migrations from several hundred metres depth during the day to near the surface at night. We tested the null hypothesis that blue whale calling behaviour does not show significant diel variation in order to determine whether variability in calling could provide an indication as to the behavioural function of B calls. The hourly rate of B calls showed a strong diel pattern. There were significantly more calls during dark and twilight periods than during light periods (P < 0.001). These diel patterns in call production correlate well with previously established diel patterns in prey distribution, with the highest calling rates occurring when prey have been reported to be closest to the surface.

AB The existence of postcopulatory sexual selection is now clearly established in many animal species. In Odonates, males remove sperm during copulation from the bursa copulatrix and (when physically accessible) from the spermatheca. We used these model organisms to test the relative importance of sperm competition and cryptic female choice for copulation duration in laboratory experiments. If long copulations evolved only because of sperm competition, males should prolong copulation with previously mated females, and use this extra time to remove/displace the stored sperm. In species without a spermatheca (or when it is physically inaccessible), copulation duration should be similar in mated and virgin females. The cryptic female choice hypothesis predicts that copulations should be prolonged (acting as copulatory courtship) when males cannot physically remove sperm from the spermatheca but not if females do not have a spermatheca. We found that male damselflies can detect the mating status of females probably using chemical sensilla in their genitalia. Copulation duration with mated females was almost twice as long as with virgins in species with a spermatheca, but this behaviour was probably not the result of sperm competition, because in our model species, males could not remove sperm from this organ. The duration of copulation did not increase in species without a spermatheca. We conclude that even in odonates, where sperm removal is widespread, females have retained control over sperm reserves in their spermatheca(e), and males prolong copulation with mated females to elicit rival sperm ejection and/or to induce females to use their sperm in fertilization.

AB Individual variation in behaviour within populations may be explained in part by demographics and longterm, stable individual psychological differences. We examined the relation between boldness (taken as the time to emerge from a shelter and explore a novel environment) and body size in eight populations of the poeciliid Brachiltuphis episcopi originating from sites upstream and downstrearn of waterfalls in four rivers that run into the Panama Canal. The relation between body size and time to emerge from a shelter was positive, with larger fish taking longer to emerge. This relation differed between downstream and upstream sites, being significant in the upstream populations only. These results are best explained by a metabolic hypothesis whereby juvenile fish are compelled to emerge earlier in order to resume feeding. In the downstream sites this effect was slightly offset by the relatively greater predation threat for smaller fish, such that they delayed their emergence from cover. We discuss the underlying importance of variation in boldness and its effects on other behavioural and life history traits.

AB Males are thought to have evolved paternity assurance mechanisms in response to the potential for multiple mating by females, but the effectiveness of these mechanisms can vary. Mate guarding is the most common paternity assurance mechanism found in birds, but there are few studies that examine its effectiveness in protecting paternity. We examined the effectiveness of mate guarding in house wrens, Troglodytes aedon, by experimentally preventing males from guarding via a short-term detention during the female's fertile period. Compared with control males, experimental males had significantly lower paternity in their broods and their mates made more frequent and longer extraterritorial forays. We also found that the increased proportion of extrapair young in experimental broods was associated with: (1) longer intrusions by extrapair males on the territory of the detained male, and (2) shorter extraterritorial forays by the resident female. Although experimental males were more likely to be cuckolded, they did not reduce their parental care to nestlings. These results support the hypothesis that male mate guarding can effectively reduce the risk of cuckoldry. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is growing evidence that, rather than maximizing energy intake subject to constraints, many animals attempt to regulate intake of multiple nutrients independently. In the complex diets of animals such as herbivores, the consumption of nutritionally imbalanced foods is sometimes inevitable, forcing trade-offs between eating too much of nutrients present in the foods in relative excess against too little of those in deficit. Such situations are not adequately represented in existing formulations of foraging theory. Here we provide the necessary theory to fit this case, using an approach that combines state-space models of nutrition with Tilman's models of resource exploitation (Tilman 1982, Resource Competition and Community Structure, Princeton: Princeton University Press). Our approach was to construct a smooth fitness landscape over nutrient space, centred on a 'target' intake at which no fitness cost is incurred, and this leads to a natural classification of the simple possible fitness landscapes based on Taylor series approximations of landscape shape. We next examined how needs for multiple nutrients can be assessed experimentally using direct measures of animal performance as the common currency, so that the nutritional strategies of animals can be mapped on to the performance surface, including the position of regulated points of intake and points of nutrient balance when fed suboptimal foods. We surveyed published data and conducted an experiment to map out the performance landscape of a generalist leaf-feeding caterpillar, Spodoptera littoralis.

AB The strength of an animal's behavioural response to human presence has often been used as an index of an animal's susceptibility to disturbance. However, if behavioural responsiveness is positively related to the animal's condition, this may be an inappropriate index, as individuals showing little or no response may in fact be those with most to lose from changing their behaviour. We tested the link between individual state and responsiveness by manipulating condition via the provision of supplementary food for turnstones, Arenaria interpres, on rocky shores. Birds at one site were fed 450 g of mealworms at low tide every day for 3 days while birds at another site acted as a control. On the fourth day, using a standardized disturbance protocol, we recorded flush distances, flight lengths and the amount of time between predator scans for birds in both flocks. After a break of 3 days, the treatments were then swapped between sites and the procedure repeated for a total of six trials. Birds whose condition had been enhanced showed greater responsiveness to standardized human disturbance, flying away at greater distances from the observer, scanning more frequently for predators and flying further when flushed. These findings suggest that our current management of the impact of human disturbance may be based on inaccurate assessments of vulnerability, and we discuss the implications of this for refuge provision.

AB In group-living animals, competition for a scarce resource often results in the formation of dominance hierarchies. Dominant individuals garner more of that resource for themselves through the use of aggression, forcing subordinates to rely on nonaggressive strategies to secure it. Stealing from dominants is common, but subordinate thieves can risk attack if caught. How, then, do subordinates decide when and where to steal? We explored whether the opportunity to learn about the location and availability of food might facilitate food-stealing attempts by male blue gouramis, Trichogaster trichopterus, a freshwater tropical fish. Our results show that subordinates were able to use learned cues to mount highly effective 'sneaky' tactics. By anticipating food location and availability, subordinates reduced the number of attacks they received as well as the amount of time they spent fleeing from dominants. More importantly, however, our results revealed unexpected plasticity in the cognitive mechanisms underlying this learning: like privately trained dominants, privately trained subordinates learned to approach food cues directly; however, on the very first occasion that subordinates were tested with a dominant present, they dramatically altered their previously learned direct approach to food cues, immediately adopting a different, sneaky tactic instead. Thus, subordinates were able to combine information about previous learning, namely an 'expectancy' of food, with the probability of future attack and adjust their food-getting strategy accordingly.

AB Numerous chemicals are known to interfere with the endocrine systems of animals. These chemicals, commonly referred to as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (hereafter EDCs), pose a particularly severe threat to animal health. They accumulate in body tissues and are highly persistent in the environment and thus can occur at significant concentrations far from their points of origin. Ecotoxicologists have used a number of animal species to identify physiological and morphological consequences of EDC exposure. Effects of exposure have typically been measured in terms of survival, development or aspects of reproductive anatomy and physiology. In recent years, ecotoxicologists have begun using behavioural endpoints as components of standard toxicological assays. There has been a concurrent although less widespread interest among animal behaviourists in understanding and studying the effects of these contaminants on animal behaviour. The purposes of this review are four-fold. First, we provide a primer on EDCs. Second, we summarize current knowledge about endocrine disruption of animal behaviour. Third, we describe the role that we envision for behaviour in the field of ecotoxicology. Finally, we hope to stimulate a dialogue between animal behaviourists and ecotoxicologists that will enhance our understanding of these environmental contaminants and their impacts on animal populations.

AB Green lacewings of the carnea group of Chrysoperla constitute a large complex of cryptic species that differ principally in their substrate-borne, vibrational mating signals. Sexual selection has very likely contributed to their recent and rapid divergence. Some theoretical models require that evolutionary environmental adaptation assist sexual selection during speciation, whereas others do not. Here, we looked for evidence of adaptation having shaped the song phenotypes of lacewing species that have different habitat preferences. First, we looked for a pattern of convergent song evolution, predicted under a hypothesis of substrate adaptation during speciation. Focusing on species confined to conifers versus those on herbaceous vegetation, we found several examples where song phenotype showed a correlation with substrate that was independent of phylogeny. We also present results of experimental tests of environmental adaptation using C. downesi and C. plorabunda, which are conifer and meadow species, respectively. Experiments addressing purely biomechanical aspects of substrate transmission showed that the songs of C. downesi and C. plorabunda propagated equally well in either grass stems or conifer branches. Behavioural experiments showed, furthermore, that individuals did not discriminate between conspecific songs played through the 'correct' versus the 'incorrect' substrate. We conclude that the pattern suggestive of environmental adaptation of lacewing songs to their substrates was not supported by experiments that explicitly tested for adaptation. The carnea group of cryptic species may be one of the few examples where sexual selection has acted on arbitrary differences in premating signals, resulting in speciation.

AB In this paper, I review the evidence associated with two hypotheses, both ultimately derived from sexual selection theory, put forth to explain social sexual segregation in human juveniles. More proximately, I posit that segregation is motivated by sex differences in body size, physical activity and competitiveness. The first hypothesis, the energetic/behavioural hypothesis, suggests that difference in energetics is a way in which males differentiate themselves from females and develop muscle and brain systems implicated in reproductive roles. The second hypothesis, the social roles hypothesis, suggests that segregation is related to learning male and female reproductive roles. The reviewed evidence supports the view that there are differences in energetics in male and female groups. With development, the vigorous behaviours shown by males take the form of specific social roles, related to dominance and competitiveness for males and maternal roles for females.

   FREQUENCY; ECOLOGY
AB The possibility of nest site fidelity of leatherback turtles, Dermochelys coriacea, raises concerns about the merit of translocating poorly located clutches to a safe hatchery. Specifically, if some females habitually nest in areas where the probability of egg survival is low because of tidal inundation, nest relocation may inadvertently select for turtles that make poor nest site selections. We investigate the nest site fidelity of leatherbacks by studying consecutive nest site selections by leatherbacks at Playa Grande, Costa Rica, from 1993 to 2001. Along the ocean-to-vegetation axis, consecutive nest placements were independent (G(4)(2) = 4.737, P = 0.315). Regardless of previous zone choices leatherbacks typically nested in the open beach above the high tide line and away from vegetation. Thus, concerns about translocation of poorly located nests are unfounded. Along the coastal axis, however, an independence model was rejected (G(36)(2) = 145.179, P < 0.001). The log-linear model-based analysis we developed and applied indicated that the pattern of dependence in nest site locations is more consistent with a hypothesis of spatial proximity in which leatherbacks simply nest close to the site of the previous nest than it is with a hypothesis of intrinsic fidelity to a specific location on the beach. Our model-based approach is suitable for other settings where longitudinal nesting data are available. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The 'challenge hypothesis' posits that variation in male testosterone levels is more closely associated with aggression in reproductive contexts than it is with changes in reproductive physiology. Numerous bird studies support this idea, but few tests have been conducted with primates. We conducted behavioural observations and noninvasive hormone sampling of 11 male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, in the Kanyawara study site, Kibale National Park, to test predictions of the challenge hypothesis. Results indicated that adult male chimpanzees showed significant testosterone increases during periods when parous females showed maximally tumescent sexual swellings. These periods were also marked by increased rates of male aggression. Male testosterone levels did not increase in the presence of maximally tumescent nulliparous females. Such females are less attractive to males: they are not mate-guarded, nor do rates of male aggression increase when they are swelling. Male chimpanzees copulate with parous and nulliparous females at similar rates, however, suggesting that testosterone increases in the presence of cycling parous females are associated with aggression rather than sexual behaviour. High-ranking chimpanzees were more aggressive than low-ranking males and produced higher levels of urinary testosterone. Thus, the predictions of the challenge hypothesis were generally upheld. This suggests that the hypothesis may have wider applicability among primates, including humans. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID FEMALE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS; MALE BONNET MACAQUES; RECONCILIATION
AB The social intelligence hypothesis, which holds that social challenges have selected for increased intelligence and social skills, has been supported by evidence that, in catarrhine primates, individuals know about the characteristics of groupmates' social relationships. Evidence for such 'triadic awareness' has not been sought for platyrrhine primates, although two platyrrhine genera, capuchins, Cebus, and squirrel monkeys, Saimiri, are among the most highly encephalized primates. We examined patterns of coalitionary recruitment in wild white-faced capuchins, C. capucinus. Analyses have shown that more dominant individuals are more likely to join aggressive coalitions than low-rankers, and that individuals preferentially support those with whom they have stronger affiliative relationships. Data from 110 fights, analysed using simulation techniques that produced distributions of results expected under null hypotheses, revealed that contestants preferentially solicited prospective coalition partners that (1) were dominant to their opponents, and (2) had better social relationships (higher ratios of affiliative/ cooperative interactions to agonistic interactions) with themselves than with their opponents. Further analyses showed that soliciting dominant partners could be explained by either of two simpler rules, 'Solicit an ally that outranks yourself' or 'Solicit the highest-ranking available individual'. However, soliciting partners with better social relationships appears to indicate triadic awareness, because subjects did not preferentially solicit the nearby individual with whom they shared the highest-quality social relationship. Effects of relative relationship quality on coalition solicitation decisions were independent of effects of dominance rank. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In the common orb-web spider Metellina segmentata, males are more powerfully built with longer legs, although females are heavier because of their egg load. Males guard females before attempting to mate, and there is considerable male-male competition because of the male-biased operational sex ratio. We used a field removal experiment to examine (1) seasonal changes in the average morphology of guarding males and (2) whether there is a pool of small males that is excluded from the webs of females. Morphological measures were subjected to a principal components analysis and changes in PC scores were examined for seasonal effects and the effects of previous removal of males. The size of guarding males (PC1) increased over the season, suggesting that smaller males were increasingly excluded from webs, but the condition of guarding males (PC2) decreased, indicating that energy reserves are depleted because the males gain little access to food during the reproductive season. When guarding males were removed, smaller males were able to take up residence. Our results show that large males have a clear advantage in monopolizing females. We discuss the manner in which selection acts to maintain large male size in this spider. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Courtship behaviour in spiders in the form of premating vibrations by males may function (1) as a male identity signal used for species recognition, (2) in suppression of female aggressiveness, (3) to stimulate female mating behaviour, or (4) as a quality signal used in female choice. We investigated the function of web vibration by male Stegodyphus lineatus in a series of experiments. Regardless of vibratory performance, all males mated successfully with virgin females but only 56.4% of males mated with nonvirgin females. Vibratory performance did not influence male mating success, but heavier males had a higher probability of mating with mated females. Males vibrated less often and produced fewer vibrations when introduced on the web of a mated female. Males that vibrated webs of virgin females mated faster than nonvibrating males, but there was no effect of vibration rate or body mass. There was no effect of male vibratory effort or vibration rate on female reproductive success measured as time to egg laying, clutch size, number of hatched young, number of dispersed young and offspring body mass after a single mating. Males vibrated on abandoned virgin female webs but the response decreased with increasing duration of female absence, suggesting that females produce a web-borne pheromone, which elicits male vibrating behaviour. Mated females were less receptive and not stimulated by male vibrating behaviour. We conclude that male premating vibrations in S. lineatus do not function as a male quality signal selected via female choice. Rather, the primary function of this behaviour may be to stimulate a receptive female to mate. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The gregarious parasitoid Cotesia glomerata (L.) is often presumed to possess the characteristic attributes of a species that manifests local mate competition (LMC), as it commonly produces female-biased broods. However, our field surveys of sex ratio and laboratory observations of adult behaviour showed that this species is subject to partial local mate competition caused by natal dispersal. On average, 30% of males left their natal patch before mating, with the proportion of dispersing males increasing with an increase in the patch's sex ratio (i.e. proportion of males). Over 50% of females left their natal patch before mating, and only 27.5% of females mated with males emerging from the same natal patch. Although females showed no preference between males that were and were not their siblings, broods from females that mated with siblings had a significantly higher mean brood sex ratio (0.56) than broods from females that mated with nonsiblings (0.39). Furthermore, brood sex ratios increased as inbreeding was intensified over four generations. A field population of this wasp had a mean brood sex ratio of 0.35 over 3 years, which conformed well to the evolutionarily stable strategy sex ratio (r=0.34) predicted by Taylor's partial sibmating model for haplodiploid species. These results suggest that the sex allocation strategy of C. glomerata is based on both partial local mate competition in males and inbreeding avoidance in females. In turn, this mating system plays a role in the evolution of natal dispersal behaviour in this species.

AB We investigated the relations between female quality and ornamentation and between male breeding investment and female ornamentation in the rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, a passerine in which both sexes have a yellow breast patch. Breast patch size in females was positively correlated with body mass and breeding status; double-brooding and primary females of polygynous males had a larger patch, and patch size could therefore be an indicator of female phenotypic quality. We conducted a field experiment to test whether males allocate their parental effort in relation to female quality, as predicted by the differential allocation hypothesis. We increased and reduced the ornament sizes of paired females and compared the behaviour of their males before and after manipulation. Frequency of brood feeding by the male was not affected by female ornament manipulation; there was a nonsignificant trend for females with enlarged ornaments, contrary to predictions, to increase their feeding rate. Reducing female ornaments resulted in a decrease in male nest attendance, a measure of passive brood defence, whereas enlarging the ornament had no effect. Males concurrently reduced their territorial (song output) and sexual activity (courtship and copulation). The reduction in sexual activity suggests that males may have changed their nest attendance in response to their mate's renesting probability. Whatever the interpretation, these results provide some of the first evidence that not only female, but also male, birds change breeding strategy according to their mate's phenotype in the wild.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID ALARM CALLS; LEXICAL ACCESS; NATIONAL-PARK; BEHAVIOR
AB Context-specific calls, which have a distinct acoustic structure and are selectively produced in specific contexts, are a prerequisite for calls that function referentially. Functionally referential calls, which convey information to conspecifics about objects and events in the external world, have been found in a number of species, notably primates. Evidence of context-specific calls in apes, however, is largely absent. We analysed whether the barks of wild male chimpanzees in the Tai Forest, C (o) over cap te d'Ivoire, are context specific. We examined the acoustic structure of barks, and other calls produced in association with barks, in six contexts, using discriminant function analysis. Chimpanzees produced context-specific signals in two ways. First, they produced two acoustically graded bark subtypes, in hunt and snake contexts, respectively. Second, they produced context-specific signal combinations of barks with acoustically different call types or drums. These signal combinations increased specificity levels in three of the six contexts to over 90%, a level similar to the classic vervet monkey, Cercophithecus aethiops, predator alarm calls. Furthermore, specific chimpanzee signals were produced in contexts other than alarm, such as travel and hunting, where the potential benefits of evolving specific calls are less obvious. These signals may convey specific context information to listeners, and thus function referentially; however, to confirm this, analyses of listeners' responses are required. The results show that two strategies for producing context-specific signals seem to have evolved in a species other than humans: chimpanzees produce context-specific bark subtypes and context-specific signal combinations.

AB Male Kuvangu frogs show repetitive calling of pulsed advertisement calls in which up to seven calls are repeated in short succession. Recordings of pairwise interactions between males showed that calls were highly synchronized, with individual calls interdigitating with each other. Males frequently switched between the leader and follower role with neither male dominating the interaction. Interactive playback experiments using synthetic calls revealed that males slightly but significantly increased the number of calls per call group with increases in stimulus call number. Males also significantly increased call rate with the number of calls in the playback stimulus. Furthermore, when presented with shortened intercall intervals, males increased their own intercall intervals, thus 'skipping' a call and avoiding overlap with the playback. The low degree of call matching suggests that repetitive calling, apart from maintaining a male's attractiveness to females relative to rival males, may mediate male-male competition. In addition, synchronized interdigitated calling may serve to reduce predation, while maintaining species-specific temporal features of advertisement calls important to females. Kuvangu running frogs may have reduced the costs associated with synchrony and alternation by using a signal timing scheme that allows them to do both simultaneously.

AB The hypotheses that try to explain mobbing behaviour can be divided into three main classes: altruistic behaviour, parental care and selfish behaviour. To try to distinguish between these hypotheses, I presented 12 Arabian babblers, Turdoides squamiceps, with a snake model, both alone and together with another babbler. Seven components of mobbing were compared in the two situations. Single babblers that were exposed to a snake model carried out mobbing-like behaviour. Mobbing in the absence of an audience or additional participants shows that it is basically a selfish behaviour, and suggests that it is an antipredator behaviour. No difference was found between males and females, and mobbing by two participants together was more intensive than mobbing by each of them on its own. These findings support the prey-predator communication hypothesis. However, the different hypotheses explaining mobbing are not exclusive, and this study does not exclude other hypotheses as secondary explanations.

AB Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, interacted with a familiar human partner across a table that contained a piece of highly desirable food and an undesirable distracter object. We explored how the chimpanzees' deployed their gestures on trials in which the food and object were out of their reach, thus creating a context in which they needed to recruit their partner's assistance in order to obtain the food. The attentional focus of their partner was directed either at the food, at the distracter object, or at a neutral location on the ceiling. Although the location of the food exerted primary control over the location of the chimpanzees' gestures, the results also clearly show that when their partner's focus was on the distracter object, the subjects modified their pattern of gesturing to accommodate the discrepancy between the object they wanted and the object on which their partner was focused. We discuss the results in the context of the evolution of joint and shared attention in humans, chimpanzees and other primates.

AB We studied copulation behaviour of the osprey, Pandion haliaetus, a semicolonial, fish-eating raptor, in Corsica (Mediterranean). Pairs copulated over a long period (45 days) and at a high rate, with, on average, 288 within-pair copulations (WPCs) for a clutch. Pairs breeding at higher density faced more frequent territorial intrusions than others and were potentially at an increased cuckoldry risk. However, and contrary to predictions of the 'paternity assurance' hypothesis for frequent copulations, we found that WPC rate decreased with increasing frequency of territorial intrusions. Male territory attendance increased with territorial intrusion frequency, to the detriment of the food provisioning of the female. Both attempted and successful WPC rates were positively related to the amount of food delivered by the male. Thus, the more frequent the territorial intrusions, the more time the male spent within his territory, the less he courtship fed and the smaller the fish he delivered, and the less the pair copulated successfully. WPC rate was also higher in newly formed pairs than in established pairs, and decreased with increasing pair bond length. The results suggest that males rely on mate guarding rather than frequent copulations to ensure paternity, and do not support the idea that sperm competition is the main cause of frequent WPCs. Nonfertilization functions of frequent copulations, such as pair bonding, mate assessment and mate retention, were likely early in the prelaying period. The findings that WPC rate decreased with mate fidelity and that females traded copulations for food suggest that mate retention was a possible function of frequent copulations in this species.

AB In many bird species with delayed dispersal, siblings differ in how long they postpone independence. Some offspring remain with their parents for a year or more and generally forego personal reproduction, while other siblings disperse in the first summer of life. We studied the basis for this variation by following dispersal among newly fledged Siberian jays, Perisoreus infaustus, carrying radiotransmitters. Postponed dispersal was the preferred option. Sibling rivalry preceded dispersal, and the larger and socially dominant siblings within broods were more likely to stay. No sex effect was found: males and females were just as likely to delay dispersal. This role of sibling rivalry shows that models explaining delayed dispersal based on ecological constraints outside the natal territory are too simplistic. The process of within-brood competition in determining which individuals disperse and which ones delay dispersal indicates that there are benefits to be gained from remaining in the natal territory.

AB We present the results of experiments on cottontop tamarins designed to explore the relationship between problem solving, inhibitory control and domain-specific experience. The colony was divided into two groups: tool-experienced (TE) and tool-inexperienced (TI). The TE group had previously participated in a series of tool-use experiments and revealed that, when selecting a tool, they used featurally relevant dimensions (e.g. shape, material, orientation) over featurally irrelevant dimensions (e.g. colour). The TI group, although experienced in other laboratory-based experiments, had never been tested on tool or other object manipulation problems. In Phase 1, involving three conditions, all subjects were tested on a series of means-end problems involving the use of a cloth to access a piece of food. Although the correct choice always involved picking the supporting cloth, we also built in an association between the correct cloth and its colour. Once the subjects reached criterion, we reversed the association between the cloth colour and the food reward in Phase 2. If the subjects solved the problems in Phase 1 by attending to cloth colour, then in Phase 2 they should have difficulty, especially given prior findings on tamarins demonstrating that reversal learning is difficult. If the subjects solved Phase 1 by attending to the functionality of the problem (i.e. the physical/causal relationship between the cloth and food), then reversing the colours in Phase 2 should have no effect on the subjects' performances. Finally, if the subjects attended to both colour and functionality, then reversing the colours should cause some decrement in performance, but less so than in the case where colour alone dominates. In Phase 2, although both groups showed a decrement in performance, indicating problems with reversal learning, TE subjects significantly outperformed TI subjects. Furthermore, the pattern of performance for TE subjects suggested that they had solved the initial problem by attending to a combination of colour and functionality or functionality alone, while TI subjects had attended to colour alone. We conclude that for tamarins with experience as tool users, colour represents a less salient feature, even when it is systematically associated with a food reward. For inexperienced tamarins, however, colour is salient and reversal learning is difficult. Together, these findings highlight the importance of exploring the relationship between inhibitory control and domain-specific problem solving.

AB We developed a system for evaluation of visual function in larval and adult fish. Both optomotor (swimming) and optokinetic (eye movement) responses were monitored and recorded using a system of rotating stripes. The system allowed manipulation of factors such as width of the stripes used, rotation speed of the striped drum, and light illuminance levels within both the scotopic and photopic ranges. Precise control of these factors allowed quantitative measurements of visual acuity and motion detection. Using this apparatus, we tested the hypothesis that significant posthatch ontogenetic improvements in visual function occur in the medaka Oryzias latipes, and also that this species shows significant in ovo neuronal development. Significant improvements in the acuity angle alpha (ability to discriminate detail) were observed from approximately 5 degrees at hatch to 1 degree in the oldest adult stages. In addition, we measured a significant improvement in flicker fusion thresholds (motion detection skills) between larval and adult life stages within both the scotopic and photopic ranges of light illuminance. Ranges of flicker fusion thresholds ((X) over bar +/- SD) at log I = 1.96 (photopic) varied from 37.2 +/- 1.6 cycles/s in young adults to 18.6 +/- 1.6 cycles/s in young larvae 10 days posthatch. At log I = - 2.54 (scotopic), flicker fusion thresholds varied from 5.8 +/- 0.7 cycles/s in young adults to 1.7 +/- 0.4 cycles/s in young larvae 10 days posthatch. Light sensitivity increased approximately 2.9 log units,from early hatched larval stages to adults. The demonstrated ontogenetic improvements in visual function probably enable the fish to explore new resources, thereby enlarging their fundamental niche.

TI Age at first mating affects parental effort and fecundity of female
   Mongolian gerbils
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; CALIFORNIA GULL; BEHAVIOR; EXPERIENCE
AB We examined effects of age at first mating on both parental effort and fecundity of female Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus. We found that, with increasing age at first mating and resulting age at first parturition, female gerbils: (1) were more likely to retrieve young removed from the nest, (2) spent more time both in contact with and nursing young, and (3) provided an environment in which pups grew more rapidly. Older mothers were also less likely to become pregnant than were younger mothers and, if successful in delivering a second litter, showed longer interlitter intervals and delivered smaller second litters. Between delivery and weaning of first litters, older mothers lost more weight than did younger mothers. We discuss these findings as consistent with the prediction from life-history theory that parental effort should increase with age-related decreases in residual reproductive value. Furthermore, and as predicted by parental investment theory, older mothers delivered reliably more male-biased second litters than did younger mothers. Because of the different sex ratios of litters born to older and younger dams, we anticipate discovery of differences in reproductive and parental behaviours of offspring of dams of varying ages as a result of differences in the intrauterine exposure of their young to testosterone.

AB We studied the association between extrapair paternity (EPP) rate and male mating status in the rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, a facultative polygynous species. Overall, 32.0% (58/181) of the chicks were not sired by the social father and 57.1% (24/42) of the broods contained at least one extrapair young. Polygynous males allocated less time to guarding their mate during her fertile period than monogamous males but did not differ in the time spent guarding their nest. Polygynous males were cuckolded more frequently than monogamous males (50.5 and 6.6% of the young, respectively) and their paternity loss was positively correlated with the degree of overlap between the fertile periods of their primary and secondary females. Paternity loss did not differ between primary and secondary broods of polygynous males and acquiring a second mate was possible only at the expense of paternity in both broods. Late broods contained fewer extrapair young, despite no significant seasonal trend in the time allocated by the male to guarding his mate. Male yellow badge size was not associated with paternity. Old males were cuckolded less frequently than first-year males, but male age had a minor effect on paternity compared with male mating status. Reproductive success (number of young fledged/year) did not differ between monogamous and polygynous males once paternity was accounted for. Together, these results suggest that mate guarding can be efficient in preventing cuckoldry, and that there is a trade-off between attracting an additional mate and protecting paternity in the rock sparrow, whereas male age and phenotype were, at best, fair predictors of paternity.

AB The decision-making process that determines when an animal should switch between tasks is a fundamental issue in the study of animal behaviour. We investigated, for the first time, such task switching in terms of the dynamics of worker populations in ant colonies. During colony emigration in the ant Leptothorax albipennis, the colony has to carry out the following three tasks: (1) transport of brood and nestmates to the new nest; (2) sorting of the brood into its characteristic pattern; and (3) building the nest wall. At the beginning of the emigration, the stimuli for all three tasks increase simultaneously but the tasks are performed sequentially by populations of workers in the colony. The issue here is how decision making at the colony level is based on the behaviour of individual workers. We used a mathematical model to explore the hypothesis that such colony level task switching is based on tasks competing for workers. The essential feature of this model is that the sequence of tasks performed by an individual worker need not match the sequence of tasks on which the colony concentrates. We base the parameterization of our model on our detailed experimental study of eight emigrations, one for each of eight L. albipennis colonies. We compared our results with earlier work that emphasizes the role of response thresholds in task-related decisions. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We used European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, to investigate the relationship between the cost paid to obtain food rewards and preference between stimuli associated with the resulting rewards. In no-choice trials either 161-m flights (high effort) or four 1-m flights (low effort) gave access to differently coloured keys. Pecking at these keys resulted in identical food rewards. When subjects were given choices between the coloured keys in choice trials without having paid any effort, the majority preferred the coloured key that was paired with the higher level of work in no-choice trials. We relate our findings to results in animal behaviour, psychology and economics, and give a theoretical account that has implications for phenomena variously recognized as the 'sunk cost fallacy' (the tendency to invest more in something after much has already been invested), 'work ethics (valuing an option more as a result of physical effort), 'cognitive dissonance' (making mental effort to overlook or re-evaluate information that does not accord with a dominant internal representation) and the 'Concorde Fallacy' (the readiness to forego more fitness for something that has been responsible for greater fitness compromise in the past).

AB We evaluated the influence of pollen-based cues on the foraging decisions made by honeybees using a series of two-choice bioassays, performed within a highly controlled indoor environment. We examined behaviours related to the choice and collection of pollen by foragers among six floral species and three artificial substrates (pollen analogues). First, we evaluated the responses of honeybees to the odours produced by different pollens (or pollen analogues) and pollen lipid extracts. Honeybees displayed similar levels of preference to the odours produced by all pollen species over those of pollen analogues, with a similar pattern of response shown to their extracts. We then evaluated behaviours of foragers in response to variation in particle size, using soybean meal that was ground and sifted to create a hierarchy of particle size classes. Bees preferred particle sizes below 150 m, but the greatest response was shown for those particle sizes below 45 mum. We also assayed the effect of varying protein content on the foraging decisions made by bees by mixing soy flour with different proportions of cellulose powder. Foragers, however, were incapable of discriminating protein content. We determined changes in the response of foragers to different levels of handling time using different sized screens through which bees were forced to crawl to reach an attractive pollen odour source. In these tests, pollen-seeking behaviours were seen to decrease with increases in handling time. When odour was presented simultaneously with other stimuli, it was the primary and overriding cue used by bees to select pollen. These results suggest that individual honeybee foragers do not discriminate among pollen sources based on intrinsic differences in quality, but instead evaluate cues that may increase their efficiency of collection and recruitment to such a food resource.

AB Despite the clear potential of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) to affect host mating behaviour via both host and parasite evolution, there have been few explicit tests of the relationships between STDs and sexual behaviour in animals. We investigated the effect of infection on host sexual behaviour within an invertebrate system. Coccipolipus hippodamiae is a sexually transmitted ectoparasite of Adalia biptinctata, the two-spot ladybird. The parasite feeds on host haemolymph, develops rapidly, and is deleterious to A. bipunctata hosts of both sexes. We examined whether infection affected mating success, and whether males or females showed any preferences with respect to infection status. We observed field mating rates of infected and uninfected ladybirds and carried out controlled laboratory experiments. We did not detect any negative effects of parasite infection on host mating vigour, nor any evidence for the existence of a host mating preference based on infection status. In addition, there was no evidence of parasite-induced changes in behaviour, such as increased promiscuity, which would increase transmission opportunities for the parasite. In summary, contrary to a body of speculation, there was no evidence of any connection between infection and mating rate, in either sex. We discuss possible explanations for these findings.

ID TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; VOCAL MIMICRY; REPERTOIRES;
   STABILITY
AB In sharp contrast with descriptions of contact calls in all other species, the contact or cohesion calls used by bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, in contexts of social isolation have been historically described as individually distinctive and categorically different whistle types, termed, 'signature whistles'. These whistle types have been proposed to function as labels or names of conspecifics. Other studies have reported an absence of signature whistles and have demonstrated that dolphins, like other species, produce a predominant shared whistle type that probably contains individual variability in the acoustic parameters of this shared whistle type. To further understand the discrepancies between different studies on dolphin whistle communication and the vast differences reported between the isolation calls of dolphins and other species, we conducted a study replicating the approach and methodologies used in the studies that originally and subsequently characterized signature whistles. In contrast to these studies, we present clear evidence that, in contexts of isolation, dolphins use a predominant and shared whistle type rather than individually distinctive signature whistles. This general class of shared whistles was the predominant call of 10 of the 12 individuals, the same shared whistle type previously reported as predominant for individuals within both socially interactive and separation contexts. Results on the further classification of this predominant shared whistle type indicated that 14 subtle variations within this one whistle type could be partially attributed to individual identity. Thus, individual variability in the production of a shared contact call, as reported for other taxa, probably accounts for individual recognition in dolphins. No evidence was found for categorically different signature whistle types in isolated bottlenose dolphins using both qualitative and quantitative techniques.

AB Songbirds are able to receive communications in networks because both senders and receivers are equipped with impressive auditory perceptual abilities. Here, we examined the effects of isolation from adult males and other conspecifics in the communication network on the development of auditory perception in zebra finches. We tested male and female zebra finches in laboratory auditory operant discriminations known to test zebra finches' abilities to perceive absolute pitch (frequency range discrimination) and relative pitch (frequency ratio discrimination), and to identify individual song notes (song note discrimination). Compared to normally reared zebra finches, birds reared apart from adult males but with siblings and the female parent (tutor-only isolates) had deficits in the frequency range discrimination. Birds reared apart from adult males and apart from all conspecifics after 35 days of age (tutor-brood isolates) had deficits in all three auditory discriminations. Analyses of song production revealed that tutor-only isolate males, directed their aberrant songs at female conspecifics, whereas tutor-brood isolate males did not. These results support the hypothesis that male and female zebra finches require specific experience with conspecifics in a communication network to develop normal auditory perceptual abilities.

AB Oestrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals released into the environment have the potential to affect animal behaviour. This study examined the relationship between plasma levels of gonadal steroids and behaviour and the effects of exogenous hormonal perturbation on the behaviour of nesting male three-spined stickleback. Plasma gonadal steroid concentrations were related to levels of nesting and aggressive behaviours: levels of oestradiol were negatively related to courtship behaviours while levels of 11-ketotestosterone were negatively related to nesting behaviours. The behaviour of male three-spined stickleback exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of an endocrine disrupter differed from the behaviour of control males. Control males increased their aggressive response to a live male conspecific over time, while males exposed to ethinyl oestradiol decreased their aggressive response. This study offers further evidence that low levels of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the environment may exert subtle yet important effects on animal behaviour.

AB The cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus has a haremic mating system. When the territorial dominant male disappears, the largest female of the harem changes sex and takes it over. During a 2.5-year field study on a high-density population, females sometimes temporarily intruded into neighbouring harems. Almost half of these females transferred to harems that they had frequently visited, suggesting that females may assess the social conditions of the harem during these visits. After the transfer, females increased in rank or escaped from similar-sized competitors in their former harem. As a result, such females could become the dominant male earlier than females that never changed harem. The females that transferred were reproductively active, but less fecund than females that did not. Their low spawning success as females may be offset by their earlier sex change to become a dominant male. We suggest that changing harems has developed as a life history tactic in high-density conditions where females, in a fish whose sex is socially controlled, compete to become male.

TI An airborne female pheromone associated with male attraction and

ID SEX-PHEROMONE; IDENTIFICATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Spiders are exemplary loners: most species are solitary, territorial, and even cannibalistic throughout much of their life spans. Communication between individual spiders involves agonistic signalling in the form of vibratory and visual displays, which serves to maintain a widely dispersed population. Pheromones, however, have been implicated in bringing the sexes together during reproduction. We identified two potential sex pheromones collected from virgin, sexually mature females of the desert spider, Agelenopsis aperta, and used the synthetic compounds to test conclusions reached from previous behavioural trials indicating that chemical cues emitted by this female class attract courting males. We also investigated the role of chemical communication in prescribing the complex male courtship sequence. In separate trials, one of the synthesized pheromones, 8-methyl-2-nonanone, was found both to attract males to the source of the cue and to elicit courtship behaviour from them at very low dosages. Pheromonal cues release most elements and stages of the male courtship sequence in A. aperta. Two fundamental differences were observed, however, between the courtship males displayed in the presence of pheromone alone versus in the presence of a sexually receptive female. (1) Behaviour patterns associated with locating a female were significantly more frequent in the pheromone-alone treatment sequences. (2) Male actions, such as wave legs, lunge and retreat, were observed only in the female-present trials. These latter acts were displayed in response to female actions made towards the courting male.

AB In many oscine species, young males learn songs that match those of their first breeding-season neighbours. Because sharing songs with neighbours may be advantageous, selection should favour birds that retain the capacity to memorize new songs later in their first year as the birds cannot know for sure who their neighbours will be until spring. We investigated whether song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, from a sedentary western population were capable of acquiring new songs after their natal summer in a two-stage laboratory experiment. In the first stage (30-90 days of age), we rotated hand-roared males equally among one set of four live tutors that had been neighbours in the field (and therefore shared songs between them). During the second stage (140-330 days old), we removed two of the original tutors and replaced them with two new tutors (which did not share any songs with the original tutors). During stage two, subjects were not rotated, but were stationed next to only one of the four tutors (they could hear the other three at a distance). Eight of 12 subjects learned songs from tutors they only heard after they were 140 days old, and six subjects learned most of their songs from a late tutor. Thus, sedentary song sparrows are capable of acquiring many; songs de novo in late autumn. These results are consistent with a song-learning strategy that provides young male song sparrows with a repertoire of songs they will share with their first breeding-season neighbours.

TI The evolution of female sexuality
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID COPULATION BEHAVIOR; SPERM COMPETITION
AB Females in monogamous species tend to be more sexually active than females in species with other mating systems. In this paper we consider the possibility that female sexuality has evolved because more sexually active females have received more male assistance. We develop a model in which there is no direct cue available to males indicating whether the female is fertile. Instead males might respond to female behaviour as an indirect cue. The latter could favour increased female sexuality if males tend to stay longer with more sexually active females. Our results show that female sexual behaviour can have a significant impact on social behaviour and that sexually active females and sexual behaviour outside fertile periods can evolve under some circumstances. We end with a discussion of theories of the evolution of female sexuality. We believe that theories based on male assistance fit empirical findings better than theories based on variation in male genetic quality. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The cottontop tamarin, Saguinus oedipus oedipus, is a cooperatively breeding monkey in which mature male and female offspring serve as helpers to assist in rearing younger siblings. Generally, only one female per social group reproduces; breeding restriction is mediated in postpubertal female offspring through low and acyclic levels of reproductive hormones. We investigated (1) reproductive activity of postpubertal male offspring, and (2) whether aggression towards male offspring and a cortisol-mediated stress response might restrict breeding of male offspring in the natal group. We examined sexual behaviour, olfactory communication and urinary hormone levels (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, luteinizing hormone, cortisol) of the subject males while we manipulated their social environment from housing in natal groups to pairing with a novel female, and after the production of their own offspring. Mounting and erection rates of the male subjects were as high in the natal group as when paired with a novel female. However, most mounts in the natal group were directed towards other males, and complete copulation sequences did not occur with natal-group females. Social environment had no significant effect on olfactory investigation of breeding females. Although hormone levels increased significantly after the subjects were removed from the natal group, the elevation was transient; the hormone levels of subjects in their natal groups did not differ from the levels shown by the same males when successfully producing their own offspring. Male offspring received more contact aggression in the natal group than when paired with the novel female. However, most of the aggression was received from siblings rather than the breeding pair, and levels of cortisol did not correspond with levels of aggression. Thus, at both a behavioural and endocrine level, mature male offspring in captive natal groups were potentially fertile, but sexual activity with natal-group females appeared to be behaviourally restricted and directed instead towards group males. In wild cottontop tamarin groups, this reproductive potential may allow male helpers flexibility to respond to breeding opportunities. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID PAN-TROGLODYTES; GAZE; CUES; ATTRIBUTION; EVOLUTION; FOLLOW; CALLS
AB We conducted three experiments on social problem solving by chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. In each experiment a subordinate and dominant individual competed for food, which was placed in various ways on the subordinate's side of two opaque barriers. In some conditions dominants had not seen the food hidden, or food they had seen hidden was moved elsewhere when they were not watching (whereas in control conditions they saw the food being hidden or moved). At the same time, subordinates always saw the entire baiting procedure and could monitor the visual access of their dominant competitor as well. If subordinates were sensitive to what dominants did or did not see during baiting, they should have preferentially approached and retrieved the food that dominants had not seen hidden or moved. This is what they did in experiment I when dominants were either uninformed or misinformed about the food's location. In experiment 2 subordinates recognized, and adjusted their behaviour accordingly, when the dominant individual who witnessed the hiding was replaced with another dominant individual who had not witnessed it, thus demonstrating their ability to keep track of precisely who has witnessed what. In experiment 3 subordinates did not choose consistently between two pieces of hidden food, one of which dominants had seen hidden and one of which they had not seen hidden. However, their failure in this experiment was likely to be due to the changed nature of the competition under these circumstances and not to a failure of social-cognitive skills. These findings suggest that at least in some situations (i.e. competition with conspecifics) chimpanzees know what conspecifics have and have not seen (do and do not know), and that they use this information to devise effective social-cognitive strategies.

AB Social dominance plays an important role in assessing and obtaining access to patchy or scarce food sources in group-foraging herbivores. We investigated the foraging strategies of individuals with respect to their social position in the group in a flock of nonbreeding, moulting barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, on high Arctic Spitsbergen. We first determined the dominance rank of individually marked birds. The dominance of an individual was best described by its age and its sex-specific body mass. Mating status explained the large variation in dominance among younger birds, as unpaired yearlings ranked lowest. In an artificially created, competitive situation, subordinate individuals occupied explorative front positions in the flock and-were the first to-find sites with experimentally enriched vegetation. Nevertheless, they were displaced quickly from these favourable sites by more dominant geese which were able to monopolize them. The enhanced sites were subsequently visited preferentially by individuals that succeeded in feeding there when the exclosures were first opened. Data on walking speed of foraging individuals and nearest-neighbour distances in the group suggest that subordinates try to compensate for a lower energy intake by exploring and by lengthening the foraging bout. Observations of our focal birds during the following breeding season revealed that females that returned to the study area were significantly more dominant in the previous year than those not seen in the area again.

AB In female mice, Mus domesticus, reunion with a same-sex conspecific is associated with intense ultrasonic vocalization. We examined whether the palatability of a familiar food eaten by a demonstrator mouse and the motivational state of the conspecific observer could modulate the number of ultrasonic calls uttered during female-female interaction in NMRI mice. A pilot study indicated that these calls were uttered almost exclusively by the observer member of the pair. Observers were either food deprived or not deprived and demonstrators were offered either no food, a palatable diet or an unpalatable diet. We monitored both the number of ultrasounds (range 65-75 kHz) uttered and a series of behavioural parameters during the first 3 min of social interaction after 24 h of separation. Observers investigated the nose area of demonstrators fed on the unpalatable diet more than the same area of demonstrators not given food. No differences were found in demonstrators' behaviour. Ultrasonic calls were given immediately after female-female reunion and were affected by both the motivational state of the observer and the salience of the information carried by the conspecific. These results suggest that the motivational state of the observer affects ultrasonic calling towards a demonstrator conspecific. Nondeprived animals produced more calls towards demonstrators fed on palatable food, whereas food-deprived subjects vocalized more to fed conspecifics, independently of the palatability of the food eaten by the demonstrator. We suggest that ultrasonic vocalization in female mice can facilitate proximity with a conspecific and the number of these calls is modulated by the salience of the information carried by the companion.

   PREY; AVOIDANCE; EVOLUTION; CONSPICUOUSNESS; RESPONSES; NOVELTY; CHICKS
AB Aposematic coloration often has an element of conspicuousness. One suggested benefit of conspicuousness is that it enables the prey to be detected at a greater distance, allowing a predator more time to make a correct decision about attacking it and thus reducing possible recognition errors made by predators. I conducted an experiment, with chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, as predators on live aposematic and nonaposematic prey, to investigate the effects of decision time and signal size on predator sampling behaviour. The chicks were subjected to different degrees of competition to influence how quickly decisions had to be made. Chicks in four treatment groups, either in the presence or absence of a competing chick, were presented with either solitary prey or prey in groups. In the presence of a competitor, chicks attacked the prey more often and more quickly and needed more attacks before they started to avoid the prey. With prey in groups, chicks took longer to attack, attacked less often, learnt to avoid prey more quickly and killed fewer aposematic prey. This experiment provides evidence for the importance of time and signal size for predators' attack decisions. More time to view prey prior to attack could produce a stronger image and thus encourage avoidance learning and produce a stronger neophobic avoidance effect.

AB The budgerigar, a small species of parrot, can learn new vocalizations throughout life and is therefore widely used as a model system for studying various aspects of vocal learning. It is not known, however, why parrots imitate sounds. To test the hypothesis that vocal imitation in budgerigars is related to pair bonding, we recorded approximately 100 contact calls from each of nine male and nine female adult budgerigars that were unfamiliar with one another and then placed them into pairs. We sampled their contact call repertoire weekly and conducted twice-weekly behavioural observation sessions. We compared contact calls by sonagram Cross-correlation and classified them by means of a hierarchical clustering algorithm. This analysis showed that all pairs developed a shared call within an average of 2.1 weeks. Further analysis revealed that eight of the nine male budgerigars imitated the contact calls of their assigned mates, while none of the females imitated the calls of their males. We conclude that contact call imitation in adult budgerigars probably contributes to pair bond :Formation and maintenance. Prior studies on budgerigars were limited by the lack of a behavioural paradigm to elicit vocal imitation reliably. Our study remedies this and thereby serves as a foundation for future studies on vocal learning in adult animals. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social insect queens reproduce while workers generally do not. Queens may also have other behavioural roles in the colony. In small, independent-founding colonies of social wasps, the dominant queen physically enforces her interests over those of the workers and serves as a pacemaker of the colony, stimulating workers to forage and engage in other tasks. By contrast, in large-colony, swarm-founding wasps, the collective interests of the workers are fulfilled in sex allocation and production of males, whether or not they coincide with the interests of the queens. The behavioural role of the queens in such species has not been extensively studied. We investigated the role of the queens both in regulating worker activity and in reducing the numbers of reproductively active queens in the swarm-founding epiponine wasp Parachartergus colobopterus. We found no evidence that queens regulate worker activity, as they were rarely involved in any interactions. Worker activity may be self-organized, without centralized active control by anyone. Furthermore, we found no evidence that the reduction in queen number characteristic of this tribe of wasps occurs in response to aggression among queens. The reduction in queen number may be a result of worker treatment of queens, although worker discrimination against some queens was not obvious in our data.

AB Nest desertion with subsequent renesting is a frequently cited response to parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater, yet the role of desertion as an antiparasite defence is widely debated. To determine whether desertion represents an evolutionary response to brown-headed cowbird parasitism, we searched the primary literature, yielding data on the desertion frequencies of 60 host populations from 35 species. Species were categorized according to three habitat types (forest, intermediate and nonforest). Because cowbirds prefer open habitat and rarely penetrate deeply into forests, nonforest species have long been exposed to widespread cowbird parasitism, whereas forest species have not. However, due to increased forest fragmentation, forest species are being increasingly exposed to extensive parasitism. The frequency of desertion of parasitized nests was significantly higher in nonforest than forest species, suggesting that the latter experience evolutionary lag. We also considered whether desertion is affected by predation frequency, degree of Current or recent sympatry with cowbirds, parasitism frequency, length of host laying season, phylogenetic relationships, and potential cost of cowbird parasitism. None of these variables created biases that could account for the observed difference in desertion frequencies of nonforest and forest species. However, species that incur large costs when parasitized had higher desertion rates among nonforest species but not among forest species. These results indicate that increased nest desertion is an evolved response to cowbird parasitism, as one would otherwise expect no relationship between desertion frequency and: the costs and length of exposure to cowbird parasitism. Although nearly all hosts have eggs easily distinguished from cowbird eggs, few or none desert in response to cowbird eggs. Instead, desertion may be a response to adult cowbirds. The scarcity of species that desert in response to cowbird eggs suggests that egg recognition is more difficult to evolve than heightened desertion tendencies and that egg recognition quickly leads to ejection behaviour once it does develop.

AB We tested a critical assumption of sexual dialectics theory (Gowaty 1997, Feminism and Evolutionary Biology, Chapman & Hall) using house mice, Mus musculus. We asked if female house mice accrue viability benefits for their offspring when they mate with males they prefer versus with males they do not prefer. Our experiment was designed to eliminate or control other mechanisms of reproductive competition besides female mate choice. After allowing females to discriminate behaviourally between two males, which were at random with respect to phenotypic variation discriminating females were paired with preferred (P) or nonpreferred (NP) males. We then tested whether females mating with males they preferred had offspring of higher viability than females mating with nonpreferred males. In pairwise comparisons, we tested for differences in offspring performance in dominance contests and in nest-building skill. At weaning, we exposed half of the pups to cold stress. We tested progeny performance and viability in the laboratory or in outdoor field enclosures. In:comparison to P females, NP females produced significantly fewer litters. Sons from P matings were socially dominant to sons from NP matings. Adult offspring from P matings;built better nests than those from NP matings. In field enclosures significantly fewer NP than P offspring survived to 60 days after introduction. Male and female progeny from P matings established larger home ranges and constructed better nests than progeny from NP matings. This is the first demonstration of progeny viability differences for females allowed to express mate preferences between males presented to them at random.

AB Grey seals breed colonially on substrates ranging from ice to rocky or sandy beaches. Clear differences in seal behaviour patterns exist among such broad classes of breeding habitat. However, finer scale topographical variation is likely to influence individual behaviour with consequences for pupping success. We examined topographical influences on the behaviour of breeding female grey seals by quantifying topography at a subseal size resolution. Using submetre resolution digital terrain models of two sites within a rocky breeding colony, we compared site topography in relation to observed differences in female behaviour at these sites. Females at both sites preferred breeding close to water (standing pools or sea) and frequently commuted between their pups and water. Topographical models indicated that one site was more costly for seals in terms of their locations and movements within the site. This was due to a lack of low-elevation land adjacent to the main access points from the sea and the reduced availability of pools. Females at this site showed reduced pup attendance and an increase in energetically costly behaviours, whilst females at the lower-cost site spent mere time interacting with their pups and resting. These topographically induced behavioural differences are likely to affect the quantity and quality of pup provisioning by mothers and influence individual pupping site selection. Less costly sites are likely to be colonized preferentially and by larger, older and more dominant females, potentially generating finescale spatial heterogeneity in female quality within the breeding colony.

AB Brood-parasitic village indigobirds, Vidua chalybeata, were bred in captivity and foster-reared by their normal host species, the red-billed firefinch, Lagonosticta senegala, or by an experimental foster species, the Bengalese finch, Lonchura striata. Captive-reared female indigobirds were. tested as adults for mate choice and for host choice. In tests of mate choice, female indigobirds responded preferentially towards mimicry songs of male indigobirds that were similar to those of the females' own foster parents. Females reared by Bengalese finches responded to male songs that mimicked Bengalese finch song rather than to male songs that mimicked their normal host species, the firefinch. In tests of host choice, females reared by Bengalese finches laid in the nests of Bengalese finches, and females reared by firefinches laid in the nests of firefinches. Wild-caught females showed the same behaviours as captive-bred females reared by firefinches. A female indigobird's social companions (firefinch or Bengalese) following her independence of her foster parents had no effect on her sexual response to male mimicry song or her choice of a host species in brood parasitism. The results support the predictions of a model of imprinting-like behaviour development in which young indigobirds;focus their attention on their foster parents, rather than a model of innate bias for songs and nests of their normal host species, or a null model of nonspecific brood parasitism and differential survival. The results provide experimental support for the recent origin of brood parasite-host associations and the significance of imprinting in speciation in these brood parasites.

AB Video playback is being increasingly used as a technique for behavioural research. The importance of critically evaluating the effectiveness of video playback is clear, as available video technology is not designed for nonhuman visual systems. We discuss several aspects concerning the perception of video images that could lead to inconclusive or erroneous results. Researchers should verify that behaviour observed in response to video playback is comparable to behaviour observed in response to live animals. We conducted such a verification using live and video playback methods to measure female response to swords of varying lengths in the green swordtail, Xiphophorus helleri. Using both methods, female response appeared to be an increasing function of male sword length. Females did not differ in their response to live and video versions of noncourting, noninteractive males, however, females tended to prefer video playbacks of males with longer swords, a result that has also been found in experiments using live males. These results suggest that females express the same qualitative mating preference, but not necessarily the same quantitative preference, for sword length when viewing video stimuli. Several methodological factors that may contribute to an apparent difference in the strength of the preference are discussed. Despite these differences, both methods produced comparable results; female response to sworded males tended to increase as sword length increased. These experiments demonstrate that video playback is an effective method to measure female preferences accurately in X. helleri and provide an example of how video playback can be evaluated in other species.

AB Many animals produce and respond to signals made up of multiple components; For example, many avian sexual displays are highly extravagant combinations of visual and acoustic elements, and are: described as being 'multicomponent'. One possible reason for the evolution of such complex signals is that they provide more reliable information for receivers. However, receivers also influence signal evolution in another important way, by how they perceive and process signals: signallers will be selected to produce signals that are more easily received. The potential, role of receiver psychology in the evolution of multicomponent signals has not previously been considered; in this review I present psychological results that support the notion that two components are better received than one alone. Detection can be improved by producing two components together, thus reducing the reaction:time, increasing the probability of detection and lowering the intensity at which detection occurs. Discriminability of multicomponent stimuli is also made easier through better recognition, faster discrimination learning and multidimensional generalization. In addition, multicomponent stimuli also improve associative learning. I show that multicomponency does indeed improve signal reception in receivers, although the benefits of producing components in two sensory modalities (bimodal multicomponent signals) may be larger and more robust than producing them in just one (unimodal multicomponent signals). This highlights the need for consideration of receiver psychology in the evolution of multicomponent signals, and suggests that where signal components do not appear to be informative, they may instead be performing an important psychological function.

AB Male chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, usually produce characteristic 'food' calls upon discovering edible objects, and are more likely to do so in the presence of a hen. Food calling is thus dependent upon food and modulated by social context, which is consistent with the idea that hens respond because they anticipate a feeding opportunity. An alternative model suggests that female behaviour is not mediated by the predicted presence of food but rather by social information, such as a low probability of male aggression. We conducted two playback experiments to explore the type of information encoded in food-associated vocal signals. Isolated hens were played recorded food calls and we compared their responses with those evoked by ground alarm calls (which have similar acoustic characteristics) and by contact calls (which are produced under similar social circumstances). Hens responded to food call playbacks by fixating downwards with the frontal binocular field, This anticipatory feeding movement was specific to food calls and did not occur in either of the control conditions. Food calls also affected looking downwards selectively. There were no differences between the call types in their effects on social behaviour, such as approach and contact calling, nor were there differences in the nonspecific effects of sound playback, such as orienting towards the loudspeaker or increased locomotor activity. Chicken food calls appear to provide conspecifics with information about the presence of food. This property has not hitherto been demonstrated in any natural system of animal acoustic signals.

AB The occurrence of different conspecific female colour morphs, with one of the morphs resembling the male, is supposed to have consequences for mate choice. There are two hypotheses linking mate choice and female colour polymorphism. First, males may mate predominantly with female morphs that differ from the male because they do not recognize androchrome females as females (male mimic hypothesis). Second, males may be more attracted to the most common morph in the population (habituation hypothesis). We tested these hypotheses in five populations of the same species, Ischnura elegans, with a range of androchrome frequencies. In each population we performed binary choice experiments in small cages. Males did not consistently prefer gynochrome females but mated predominantly with the most common morph in the population. Moreover, a reanalysis of the available damselfly data in the literature also supported the habituation hypothesis. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social interaction is often regarded as crucial for song copying in zebra finches, Taeniapygia guttata. Contingencies in the interaction between pupil and tutor might be essential. for the song-copying process. The effect of contingency between a pupil's operant behaviour and tutor song has been studied previously, but with contradictory results. Our aim in this experiment was to provide a more rigorous test of the effect of operant contingent exposure to song playback in zebra finches. Eight experimental males were trained to expose themselves to tutor song by operant key pecking during their sensitive phase for song learning. Each bird had a yoked control, which heard the same tutor song at the same time. All birds were acoustically isolated. The results were surprising in two ways: (1) the control birds copied song to which they were passively exposed; and (2) the experimental birds did not copy more than the controls did. So, we found no effect of operant contingency on song learning. Furthermore, when tested as adults all but one male preferred the tutor song to an unfamiliar one. We conclude that zebra finches can copy playback song, and that social interaction is not crucial for song copying, although it might still be facilitating.

AB Analysis of behaviour that is displayed in bouts depends crucially on quantitative estimates of bout criteria, that is, the lengths of the shortest intervals between bouts. Current methods estimate bout criteria by modelling the log-transformed (cumulative) frequency distributions of intervals between events. For analysis of feeding behaviour, these models will not result in biologically meaningful quantitative estimates (Tolkamp et al. 1998, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 194, 235-250). We proposed a method that models the frequency distribution of log-transformed interval lengths instead. Applying this method to a single data set showed that the log-transformed lengths of intervals between feeding events were distributed as two Gaussians. Here we test this model using a data set of 35 171 intervals between feeding that was obtained during an experiment with 38 cows in three dietary treatment groups. No meaningful bout criterion could be obtained for some individuals, which casts doubt on the general validity of the proposed model. Addition of a third log-normal improved the fit of the model and we hypothesized that this third population represents intervals including drinking. In a second experiment, we found the measurements to be consistent with this hypothesis.-Mie obtained meaningful meal criteria for all individuals by fitting either a double, or a triple, log-normal model to the frequency distributions of the lengths of intervals between feeding. These log-normal models appear to be not only more biologically meaningful than log (cumulative) frequency models but also far more flexible.

AB Differences among individuals are necessary for natural selection to occur. The extent and expression of these differences can limit the power of selection to cause evolutionary change. When individuals inconsistently express a trait, selection is less powerful. Labile traits such as behaviour are most likely to be inconsistent in their expression, because of the substantial role of environmental factors in their immediate expression. Previous work has focused on the consistency, or repeatability, of individual behaviour across different environments or within a single environment; little is known about how repeatability within an environment changes across environments. To address this issue, we examined the consistency of antipredator behaviour in juvenile garter snakes in different thermal environments. A group of 59 laboratory-born garter snakes, Thamnophis ordinoides, was repeatedly assayed for sprint speed, distance crawled, and number of reversals performed during flight and antipredator display. Antipredator display showed very little variation and could not be analysed. Each individual was tested three times at each of three temperatures chosen to span the range of temperatures that snakes encounter in the field (15, 22.5, 30 degrees C). Temperature had substantial effects on the average expression of each behaviour;snakes crawled more slowly, for shorter distances, and performed fewer reversals at cooler temperatures. Individuals showed significant consistency in their behaviour, and this consistency of expression was not affected by temperature. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Individual recognition and memory in lobster dominance

ID HOMARUS-AMERICANUS; BEHAVIOR; HIERARCHIES; OPPONENTS; ODORS
AB American lobsters, Homarus americanus, form stable dominance relationships in captivity. Size, sex and stage in the moult cycle are important determinants for dominance. Other factors, such as recent agonistic experience play a role. This paper investigates how lobsters maintain their stable dominance relationships: they may recognize individuals or alternatively, recognize overall dominance status. We paired lobsters in two consecutive 'boxing matches'. Results indicate that lobsters remember familiar opponents when kept either in isolation or in communal tanks for 24 h between their first and second fights. Subordinates immediately backed away from familiar dominants, avoiding a second fight. In some animals, this memory lasted between 1-2 weeks if pairs were kept separate between the first and second fights. When paired for the second fight against unfamiliar dominant lobsters, subordinate lobsters from first fights actively fought and won the encounter. These results suggest that lobsters are capable of 'individual recognition'. In nature, the observed social organization of lobsters may be maintained by individual recognition of a small number of residents inhabiting separate, nearby shelters.

ID PREDATOR INSPECTION; LEPOMIS-GIBBOSUS; MINNOW SHOALS; DOMINANCE;
   BEHAVIOR; RISK
AB Natural selection often promotes a mix of behavioural phenotypes in a population. Adaptive variation in the propensity to take risks might explain individual differences in shyness and boldness in humans and other species. It is often implicitly assumed that shyness and boldness are general personality traits expressed across many situations. From the evolutionary standpoint, however, individual differences that are adaptive in one context (e.g. predator defence) may not be adaptive in other contexts (e.g. exploration of the physical environment or intraspecific social interactions). We measured the context specificity of shyness and boldness in a natural population of juvenile pumpkinseed sunfish, Lepomis gibbosus, by exposing the fish to a potentially threatening stimulus (a red-tipped metrestick extended towards the individual) and a nonthreatening stimulus (a novel food source). We also related these measures of shyness and boldness to behaviours observed during focal observations, both before and after the introduction of a predator (largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides). Consistent individual differences were found within both contexts, but individual differences did not correlate across contexts. Furthermore, fish that were scored as intermediate in their response to the metrestick behaved most boldly as foragers and in response to the bass predators. These results suggest that shyness and boldness are context-specific and may not exist as a one-dimensional behavioural continuum even within a single context.

AB Frequency modulations in the perch coos of collared doves, Streptopelia decaocto, affected the responses of territorial males. In this study we used playback experiments to reveal the impact of absolute and relative aspects of the frequency modulations on this responsiveness; Modulated coos always led to stronger responses compared with unmodulated coos, irrespective of the size of the frequency modulation, except when they contained frequencies outside the natural range. We found an optimum for the size of the frequency modulation, with the strongest responses to coos containing frequency modulations of 75-108 Hz, even though higher modulations are still within the species-specific range. The selective responsiveness shows that territorial males are perceptually tuned to the species-specific frequency range and to the species-specific frequency modulation size. This allows a delineation of the optimal acoustic design of the territorial signal, based on the responsiveness of the receiver. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

   how do workers know when to start building?
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPORAL POLYETHISM; TASK ALLOCATION; WAX SECRETION; ORGANIZATION
AB Colonies of honeybees, Apis mellifera, initiate new comb construction only when two conditions are met: (1) they are currently collecting nectar and (2) they have filled their available comb beyond a threshold level with brood and food. In this study I explored how the individual. workers responsible for building might use readily accessible local cues to acquire this global information on colony and environmental state. In particular, I tested the hypothesis that comb is built by nectar receivers (bees specialized to receive nectar from foragers and store it in comb cells) that experience increased distension of their crops. Crop distension could serve as a cue that both conditions for building have been satisfied, because the bees' crops will fill up as they receive nectar from successful foragers and have difficulty finding comb in which to store it. However, two findings led to rejection of this hypothesis. First, very few nectar receivers participated in comb building. Most builders came from another, unidentified subpopulation of workers. Second, potential builders showed no increase in crop size correlated with the onset of new comb construction or with the development of conditions that favour comb building. This was true both for identified nectar receiver bees and for bees belonging to the age cohort at which wax secretion and comb building reach their peak levels. The behavioural repertoire of comb-building-bees suggests that these builders come from a pool of underemployed bees that may evaluate colony state by direct inspection of comb; cells.

AB The courtship song of Drosophila is thought to be involved in sexual selection and species recognition. Because of the mating system of flies, however, directly demonstrating that song influences female preference is difficult. The majority of previous studies have used an experimental design that potentially confounds male and female reactions to song. In D. montana, correlational evidence has suggested that males that produce short sound pulses consisting of a high number of sound cycles (i.e. a high carrier frequency) have a higher mating-success than other males. In this study, we played synthetic song that varied in pulse length and carrier frequency to individual females in the laboratory, both alone and in the presence of mute males. We scored female preference via an acceptance posture, 'wing spreading', which the females of this species usually display prior to mounting by a male. Females responded to synthetic song in the absence of males. The presence of mute males significantly increased their overall responsiveness, but the relative effectiveness of the songs did not change, eliminating male reaction to song as a possible confounding factor in the results. The interaction between pulse length and carrier frequency determined the discrimination between song types, with females responding most readily to song consisting of short pulses with a high carrier frequency. Thus, direct examination of female preferences supports the previous studies of male mating success, and confirms female song preference as a likely determinant of male mating success.

AB Differences in Drosophila courtship song elements are thought to confer species sexual isolation because of the low levels of variation within species, the large differences often seen between closely related species, and the results of experiments using synthetic songs in two species groups. In this study, we reanalyse the courtship song elements of D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. We confirmed the differences between these species in high-rate repetition song interpulse interval (IPI) and intrapulse frequency and in the amount of low-rate repetition song produced. We found that both X-chromosome and autosomal loci contribute to the differences between D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis in their IPI and intrapulse frequency. No association was detected between IPI and hybrid male mating success to females of either species, although frequency was associated with mating success to D. persimilis females. Additionally, we found evidence of IPI periodicity in the song of D. persimilis, demonstrated differences in mean IPI between D. pseudoobscura populations, and showed a significant influence of temperature on IPI and intrapulse frequency. Such environmental effects may have obscured tests for population differentiation in courtship song parameters in other species, and we suggest the possibility that differences between Drosophila species in mean courtship song IPI might only rarely affect their sexual isolation.

AB Individuals often benefit from identifying their prospective social partners. Some species that live in stable social groups discriminate between their group mates and others, basing this distinction on calls that differ among individuals. Vocalizations that differ between social groups are much less common, and few studies have demonstrated that animals use group-distinctive calls to identify group mates. Female greater spear-nosed bats, Phyllostomus hastatus, live in stable groups of unrelated bats and give audible frequency, broadband calls termed screech calls when departing from the roost and at foraging sites. Previous field observations suggested that bats give screech calls to coordinate movements among group members. Prior acoustic analyses of 12 acoustic variables found group differences but not individual differences. Here, we use the same acoustic variables to compare calls from three cave colonies, and find that calls differ between caves. We also report results from field and laboratory playback experiments designed to test whether bats use acoustic differences to discriminate calls from different colonies, groups or individuals. Results from field playbacks indicate that response depends on the cave of origin, indicating that bats can discriminate among calls from different caves. This discrimination ability may be based, in part, on;whether calls are familiar or unfamiliar to the listening bats. Laboratory playbacks demonstrate that bats discriminate calls given by their group mates from calls given by other bats from the same cave irrespective of familiarity. However, these experiments provide no evidence that bats discriminate among individuals. Previous field work indicates that females that forage with social group mates map benefit from shared information about food or mutual defence of feeding sites. Indicating group membership is essential? since these benefits appear to be restricted to group mates. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Future value and patch choice in least chipmunks
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR; RECOVERY; MEMORY
AB Animals subsisting on non-renewing patches confront a unique valuation problem, in which the objective value of a patch is inversely related to the amount already harvested. We investigated whether the subjective patch valuations of captive least chipmunks, Tamias minimus, reflected this environmental constraint as they foraged for buried patches of seeds. On the day following partial depletion of two patches, chipmunks spontaneously selected the least depleted patch, despite having no direct information about its former or present value. These findings held across experiments in which the order and extent of patch depletion were under the forager's control or experimental control. The animals consistently chose sites from which they had taken the fewest items, despite experiencing no difference in relative capture rate, suggesting that they discounted patch value on the basis of amount harvested or harvest time. Furthermore, the animals refused to return to patches they had completely depleted, and when induced to re-dig depleted patches by placing seeds above them, the animals chose randomly despite a three-fold difference in the number of items previously taken from each, suggesting that they disregarded rewards taken, attending only to the amount remaining. Subsequent experiments showed that chipmunks can take past reward history into account. When we refilled previously depleted patches and induced chipmunks to re-dig and deplete them again, they treated the patches as renewable types and represented their value in terms of the amount removed, not the amount left. Thus, the assessment mechanism of least chipmunks is facultative: they expect that patches will not replenish, but are prepared for exceptions.

AB The morphologically specialized queen caste has been lost in various ponerine ants, and mated workers ('gamergates') reproduce instead of queens. Unlike previous reports in the literature, we found only one gamergate in each colony of Dinoponera quadriceps. We documented monogyny by dissecting ovaries and spermathecae in 914 workers from 15 colonies, and by observing mating in the laboratory. In colonies without a gamergate, aggressive interactions among some of the unmated nestmates led to the behavioural differentiation of a top-ranking worker ('alpha'), which laid almost all the eggs. Only the alpha went outside the nest at night, and mated if foreign males were present (N=11 tests), thus becoming a gamergate. The alpha was sexually attractive even when her ovaries were not yet active. After intromission, the male remained linked to the alpha while she severed the end of his abdomen. Pieces of the male genitalia remained attached to her genital tract, and she removed them after 30 +/- 18 min ((X) over bar SD; N=9). We interpret this to be a mating plug, preventing other males from fathering her offspring. None of these newly inseminated gamergates continued to go outside the nest, and, when tested, they never re-mated (N=4). Thus, gamergates of D. quadriceps probably mate only once. In queenless ant species, comparative evidence indicates that worker mating is often regulated in monogynous species, while unrestricted mating of young individuals is typical of polygynous species (oviposition is regulated subsequently). Furthermore, the occurrence of either monogyny or polygyny influences the mating strategies of males, and mating plugs have been reported only in some monogynous species.

   ECHOLOCATION; SIGNALS
AB The function of social calls emitted by foraging bats has received little study. Here we use observations of free-ranging greater spear-nosed bats, Phyllostomus hastatus, and field playbacks to determine whether audible, broad-band 'screech' calls attract mates, warn conspecifics or influence access to food. Five lines of evidence suggest that screech calls enable adult females from the same roosting group to fly together from the day roost to feeding sites. (1) Seasonal differences in diet influenced the rate of screech calling recorded outside the cave roost, as well as how often bats departed together. Bats called more often and flew in larger groups when feeding on a concentrated resource, balsa, Ochroma lagopus, flowers, in winter than on more dispersed Cecropia peltata fruit in spring. (2) Observations of bats flying outside the cave, in flyways and at feeding sites indicated that screech calls occurred more often when bats flew in groups than alone. (3) Females from the same roosting group were netted at the same feeding site, sometimes simultaneously, several kilometres from the cave. (4) Calling colour-marked adult females outside the cave were joined by a female group member, both on initial departures and on second foraging trips, more often than non-calling bats. (5) Playbacks attracted conspecifics at roost and feeding sites. Screech calls appear to function as contact calls that recruit and coordinate foraging among group members. We postulate that females benefit from foraging with unrelated roost-mates because they can defend feeding sites more effectively. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The effect of experience on pre-and post-alighting host selection in adult female Helicoverpa armigera was tested in an indoor flight cage, and in a large greenhouse. The moths had experienced either tobacco or tomato plants (both are hosts of H. armigera) for 3 days, or were given no experience. Individuals were then released and their host selection assessed. All individuals caught in the greenhouse were identified and tested for post-alighting acceptance on each host. Experience significantly influenced both pre-and post-alighting host selection in ovipositing moths. This modification in behaviour is attributed to 'learning', and presents the first detailed evidence for learning in moths. Possible behavioural mechanisms involved are discussed, and a hypothesis is presented regarding learning in post-alighting host acceptance. The existence of learning in H. armigera, a highly polyphagous agricultural pest, is discussed in the light of current theories on environmental predictability and the advantages of learning.

TI Partnerships and mechanisms of divorce in the great skua
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID MATE RETENTION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; BIRDS; SITE; SIZE; TIT
AB There are two main theories attempting to explain divorce in birds as an adaptive decision for at least one of the members of the pair. The 'incompatibility hypothesis' states that birds separate because they are unsuccessful breeders as a pair, although their individual characteristics are not negative per se. Divorce comes about as an initiative of both individuals to search for a more compatible mate. The 'better option hypothesis' suggests that divorce is usually initiated by one of the birds in search of a 'higher quality' partner (or territory). The ages of partners of great skuas, Catharacta skua, breeding on Foula (Shetland) were poorly correlated (r(48)=0.28), 22% of the partners differing in age by 10 years or more. Mate fidelity in this population was high, with an annual divorce rate of only 6.4% (N=20/311). Death was responsible for-three times more interruptions of partnerships than divorces. Three types of divorce were detected. (1) In six cases, females deserted their partners, leaving them temporarily unpaired. (2) One female was recorded being forced to desert her partner by a usurper. (3) One female deserted her partner after they lost their breeding territory to another pair. Mate changes had a direct cost, because new pairs (of experienced birds) laid later in the season and reared fewer chicks. After mate loss, 26% (N=61) of the individuals did not breed, while faithful pairs always laid eggs (N=222). Males, but not females, had a higher probability of remaining unpaired after being divorced than after becoming widowers. There was no difference between the sexes in the probability of re-pairing after a mate died. The results suggest that divorces that are initiated by birds within the pair are better explained by the 'better option hypothesis' than the 'incompatibility hypothesis'.

AB We examine nest construction in the ant Leptothorax tuberointerruptus at two levels: (1) the building behaviour of individual workers and (2) the collective properties (temporal and spatial) of the structures they create. We also explore, for the first time explicitly, the linkage between these two levels. Leptothorax tuberointerruptus nests occur in flat cavities which provide the roof and the floor of their dwelling places. Hence, they construct only a peripheral encircling mall, breached by one or more entrance passageways. The wall is constructed brick by brick. This facilitates experimental estimation of the probabilities of individual workers picking up and depositing building material in response to different stimuli. We incorporate both the qualitative and quantitative behavioural rules that workers employ during building into a mathematical model. This model confirms that a surprisingly small and simple set of behavioural rules are not only sufficient for wall construction bu; also for the formation of one or more nest entrances. In addition, this model predicts that the nests of these ants are likely to exhibit interesting dynamics, in which, for example, the tendency to build a new larger nest may lag behind growth of the population that the nest has to house. We present experimental evidence that suggests that this prediction is valid. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Adult male Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus, gestated in intrauterine positions between two female fetuses (2F males) are less likely than are adult males gestated between two male fetuses (2M males) to impregnate strange female gerbils with whom they are paired. The reduced copulatory success of 2F males is correlated with both lower circulating levels of and reduced sensitivity to testosterone. We asked whether 2F male gerbils compensated for their reduced copulatory success by increasing their parental effort. 2F male gerbils engaged in less sexual activity with their mates, but were more frequently in contact with pups than were 2M males, huddling over the young when their mates were absent from the nest. Although there were no differences in rates of survival or growth of pups reared by pairs consisting of a female and either a 2M or 2F male, mates of 2F males delivered significantly more pups as a consequence of copulations occurring during postpartum oestrus than did either mates of 2M males or females rearing young alone. We interpreted these results as consistent with Ketterson & Nolan's (1992, Am. Nat. (Supplement), 140, 533-562) hypothesis of a testosterone-mediated trade-off between investment in sexual and parental behaviours. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   ONTOGENY; NEPOTISM; MOTHERS; FEMALES; SNAKES; MALES
AB Experiences with adult conspecifics can influence the ontogeny of species-typical behaviours in naive young of many species. Two processes of influence, direct and indirect, are proposed to describe the effect of adult behaviours on juvenile development. In Belding's ground squirrels, Spermophilus beldingi, exposure to adults experienced with responding to alarm calls may affect how juveniles respond to calls and/or the rate at which juveniles acquire adult-like responses to calls. Because dams and their juvenile offspring interact extensively during early development, the influence of dams on the ontogeny of juvenile alarm-call responses was investigated by conducting playbacks of alarm calls and non-alarm calls to captive ground squirrels. Juveniles were more likely to respond to auditory stimuli if their dam responded, but the responses of unrelated adult females did not influence juveniles. A dam's presence at the time of a playback had no consistent effect, however, on the type of initial response made by her juvenile, its response duration or the vigilance of its postures. The permanent absence of adult models (dams) after weaning appeared to delay the rate at which juveniles developed a discrimination between alarm calls and non-alarm calls, but had no long-term influence on juveniles' expression of responses. Thus, dams indirectly influenced juvenile response development by acting as models of species-typical responses. The outcome of dams' influence was facilitative rather than inductive, because exposure to dams affected the rate of response development but was not necessary for juveniles to acquire alarm-call responses.

ID CEBUS-APELLA
AB To determine whether young capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella, selectively interacted with others concerning novel foods, 11 infants (4.5-12 months) living in two groups were observed following presentation of familiar or novel foods. Foods were presented either to the whole group or to infants in a section of the home cage to which only they had access. Infants showed more frequent interest in others' food and picked up foods more frequently when foods were novel, and they tended to eat novel foods more frequently than familiar foods. The pattern was the same whether the foods were presented to the group or only to infants. Infants expressed interest in others' novel foods equally often before and after sampling these foods themselves. The frequency of interest in others' food correlated positively with age. It is concluded that acceptance of novel foods in these monkeys occurs readily regardless of socially provided information about edibility. Social interactions do not appear to make important contributions to acceptance of novel foods by infant capuchin monkeys. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Intraspecific female aggression during the breeding season can have several different functions: defence of resources, defence against intraspecific brood parasitism and defence of mating status. The intraspecific aggressive behaviour of breeding female starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, was examined by exposing them to a simulated intrusion of a conspecific bird. A caged male or female starling was placed close to the nest of a breeding pair. Aggressiveness was scored as the proportion of time birds spent near the caged birds after discovery. Caged females elicited stronger responses from females than caged males. Females sang at caged females and sometimes also attacked them. They were most aggressive towards them during the pre-laying period and less so during the egg-laying, incubation and nestling periods. Females were more aggressive towards a caged female when their mate had access to an additional nestbox to which he could attract an additional female, then when he had not. A time-budget study demonstrated that females spent more time near their nest site during the pre-laying period when their mate had access to an additional nestbox than when he had not. These patterns are most consistent with females trying to secure male brood-rearing assistance by preventing or delaying the settlement of secondary females, since early established secondary females may compete for male help in incubating eggs and feeding nestlings.

ID HENS; PREFERENCES; NEEDS; RATS; SIZE; FOOD
AB The importance of a commodity, as perceived by animals, can be determined by measuring the amount of work animals are prepared to perform to gain access to that commodity. In the present study, this method is extended to establish how animals perceive the importance of increasing amounts of one commodity, that is, additional space. The behavioural demand functions of caged laboratory mice, Mus musculus, for additional space ranging from 196 cm(2) to 1600 cm(2) on fu;ed-ratio schedules ranging from 5 to 80 switch operations were determined. At all fixed-ratio values, the mice worked economically and gained access to additional space on several occasions within each l-h observation session. The amount of access gained decreased as the work required increased, but the slope of the function (-0.347) was sufficiently shallow to indicate that additional space was regarded by the mice as a highly important commodity. The frequency of visits and the time spent in the additional space were significantly different between the sizes of additional space offered, but unexpectedly, these differences were small. In addition, the elasticity coefficients were not significantly different between the sizes of additional space. The absence of large differences in response to disparate sizes of additional space may indicate that the mice may have (1) been motivated to escape their home-cage, (2) been motivated to search for unavailable resources, or (3) perceive the different amounts of additional space as nearly equally (non-)rewarding. Time of day had a significant effect on the responses of the mice in that towards the end of the active phase, the additional space was visited less frequently and for shorter periods indicating a temper-ally based change in motivational status or efficiency of behaviour. It is argued that these results support previous evidence that laboratory mice are highly motivated to explore and subsequently monitor areas made accessible to them, regardless of size and, to some extent, content.

TI Do cuttlefish (Cephalopoda) signal their intentions to conspecifics
   during agonistic encounters?
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID AGGRESSIVE INTERACTIONS; BLUE PENGUINS; BEHAVIOR; COMMUNICATION
AB Male cuttlefish adopt a specific body pattern during agonistic behaviour called the Intense Zebra Display. Some components of the Display were variable, especially the chromatic component termed 'dark face', which could vary in the degree of darkness. Facial darkness was measured using a video analysis system. Males that eventually withdrew from conspecifics without fighting maintained a lighter face during the initial stage of agonistic encounters. When both males maintained dark faces, physical contact and fighting ensued. Therefore facial darkness could be used to predict which male-male encounters would escalate to physical contact. The strong correlation between facial darkness and subsequent behaviour suggested that males were signalling their agonistic motivation at the early stages of the encounter, which is contrary to what would be predicted from a traditional game theory analysis. It is proposed that males signal intent because the Intense Zebra Display simultaneously serves two functions: (1) it identifies the signaller as male, thus preventing unwanted copulations from other males, and (2) it functions as part of the agonistic behavioural repertoire. By using a modified (i.e. lighter-faced) version of the Display, males may be able to signal their sex, but without inducing another male to attack. In cases in which agonistic displays perform more than one function, signalling intent (i.e. signalling its likely subsequent behaviour) can be an evolutionarily stable strategy.

   ODOR; CONSPICUOUSNESS; EXPERIENCE; AVERSIONS; PYRAZINES
AB Many warningly coloured prey emit a conspicuous smell of pyrazines when attacked by a predator and it has been suggested that this odour cue constitutes part of the prey's aposematic anti-predator defences. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that pyrazine odours enhance the neophobic response of birds towards prey that is novel in appearance. Naive domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, were presented with food or water that was either familiar or novel (coloured with food dye) in appearance, in the presence or absence of five different odours. The odours in question were 2-methoxy-3-sec-butyl pyrazine, 2-methoxy-3-isobutyl pyrazine, almond oil, vanilla oil and thiazole. Presence of each of the pyrazines and of almond odour increased the latency with which chicks ate or drank, but only when the food or water was a novel colour. The effect was weaker with vanilla odour and absent with thiazole. When odours of 2-methoxy-3-sec-butyl pyrazine and thiazole were paired with a novel-coloured environment, eating and drinking were not inhibited. This suggests that odours naturally associated with chemical defence in insects or plants do enhance neophobia, but only when presented in conjunction with prey that has a novel appearance. However, confounding factors such as differences in odour intensity cannot at present be excluded. The implications of the results for theories concerning the evolution of warning coloration are discussed. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB A reduction in individual vigilance with an increase in group size is one of the most frequently reported relationships in the study of animal behaviour. It has been argued that this phenomenon may not be a direct consequence of an increase in group size but may be due to other factors relating to increased group size, such as increased foraging competition. However, there is evidence for a direct relationship between group size and vigilance where other variables have been controlled. The aim of this review is to highlight the fact that the functional explanation of the group size effect remains unclear. Some authors have considered just one hypothesis, the group vigilance or 'many eyes' hypothesis. This states that, by taking advantage of the vigilance of other group members, individuals can reduce their own vigilance. However, there is an alternative, or additional, possibility that if individual vigilance declines with a reduction in individual predation risk, the group size effect could be accounted for by a reduction in individual risk at higher group sizes, as is widely thought to occur through encounter, dilution and confusion effects. In this review, it is shown that evidence previously interpreted in terms of one hypothesis may also be interpreted in terms of the other. Future research should be directed towards explicit consideration of the two effects and empirical tests to distinguish their relative importance. It is proposed that the individual risk hypothesis, with group vigilance as one element, provides a more general framework for understanding variation in vigilance behaviour with group size and with other factors.

AB Two models of temporal polyethism in the honey bee were evaluated. The developmental-programme model asserts a causal relationship between age and task performance. The foraging-forwork model asserts that this relationship is an epiphenomenon associated with a self-organizing system. The effect of a worker's pre-foraging environment on task selection as a forager was also examined. Four groups of workers, emerging at 6-day intervals, were introduced to a colony. Workers in group 1 were introduced when less than 12 h old. Workers in groups 2 and 3 were divided into deprived and non-deprived groups. Non-deprived groups were introduced to the colony when less than 12 h old. Deprived groups were confined to an incubator for 12 days and 6 days, respectively, then introduced to the colony along with group 4 (<12 h old). Foraging activities were quantified for two sets of workers from strains of bees selected for high and low pollen hoarding. The results support the developmental-programme model. Non-deprived workers began foraging in the order that they were introduced. Deprived workers from groups 2 and 3 began to forage before younger workers in group 4, even though all three groups were introduced to the colony at the same time. The results also suggest that a forager's task selection is primarily determined by her genotype and immediate environment. High-strain workers collected pollen more often than low-strain workers, regardless of their pre-foraging environments. Differences between deprived and non-deprived groups of the same strain and age were rare. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The detection of stress arising from parasitic infection by Sarcoptes scabieis and from pregnancy is explored, using a fractal analysis of head lifting behaviour and feeding-non-feeding activity sequences in female Spanish ibex, Capra pyrenaica, under natural conditions. Because organisms under stress increase their metabolic rate and, in consequence, energy consumption, it follows that stress will, generally, lead to a reduction in complexity (fractal dimension) of exploratory behaviour. In the present study the fractal dimension of the three measures of complexity used declined with stress, both from pregnancy and from parasitic infection. This observation provides a new and effective way to assess the general state of animals' health in the field, without the need for capture and handling.

AB Fluctuating asymmetries are small, random developmental accidents in morphological traits that would otherwise be described as being bilaterally symmetric. Experimental evidence indicates that in mate choice situations individuals possessing symmetric arbitrary traits or symmetric secondary sexual characters are preferred over those with larger asymmetries. This experiment investigated the effect of symmetric and asymmetric arbitrary traits (arrangements of coloured leg-bands) on reproductive success in captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Six groups of six males and six females were separated into six free-flight breeding aviaries. Nestboxes and nesting material were freely available throughout the experiment. Males wore symmetric and asymmetric arrangements of the same coloured leg-bands. Each male wore two orange and two light green bands, two on each leg. There were six possible arrangements of these leg-bands. One male from each of these six leg-band treatments was present in each aviary, along with six females wearing numbered orange bands. Symmetrically banded males produced more offspring that survived past the period of parental care than males in either of the asymmetric treatments; this appeared to be the effect of female choice processes and female-based parental investment and not male intra-sexual dominance. This is the first experiment to indicate that symmetrically manipulated males gain reproductive advantages in controlled laboratory conditions and further supports recent theories indicating the evolutionary importance of symmetry in signalling-trait design.

AB The reproductive strategies of large, solitary carnivores have seldom been studied because of the difficulties in obtaining detailed mating observations and reliable parentage determinations. Using DNA fingerprinting, the mating system of a natural black bear, Ursus americanus, population, occupying the Chapleau Crown Game Preserve, Ontario, Canada, was investigated. DNA fingerprints for paternity analysis were obtained using alkaline phosphatase-labelled multilocus probes and chemiluminescent detection. DNA samples were collected from four complete mother-offspring groups, and 45 males were tested as possible fathers. Fingerprinting demonstrated both single and multiple paternity within litters, and one male was identified as the father for cubs from two litters during 1 year. This evidence, coupled with field observations of pairs of adults, indicates that multiple mating is practised by both sexes. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Individual differences in behaviour have been related to variations in early social milieu, such as those at the age of weaning and in litter gender composition. To understand better the respective role that these two variables have in the ontogeny of behaviour, the effects of their manipulation in developing CD-1 mice, Mus domesticus, were assessed. On postnatal day 15, 32 litters were split in half. Each half litter contained four males or four females, or two of each sex. At the same time, one half litter was weaned (Precocious Weaning, PW), while the other remained with the dam (Regular Weaning, RW). The behaviour of each half litter was scored (single 15-min session) on days 16, 20 and 24. Cage exploration increased and affiliative behaviour decreased with age. Solitary play showed a non-monotonic profile with a peak on day 20. Early weaning was associated with both an increased expression of jumping and eating, and shorter self-grooming periods, and also induced a female primacy in exploration and solitary play. Females also appeared to be more involved than males in an affiliative item, pushing the snout under another pup's body. Finally, isosexual subjects spent more time in cage exploration and less time in social inactivity than sex-balanced controls. In conclusion, dam and sibling effects seemed to act independently of each other, stressing the importance of different facets of early social milieu for mouse behavioural development.

AB Models of sexual selection have recently been broadened to include the pre-existing bias model. This model suggests that female preferences that result in the evolution of male traits can be established prior to the appearance of a male trait. Previous work suggests that in the genus Xiphophorus, which consists of swordless platyfish and sworded swordtails, female southern platyfish, X. maculatus, prefer conspecific males with surgically attached swords, despite phylogenetic evidence that the common ancestor of platyfish and swordtails was swordless. In the present study, female X. maculatus were found to prefer conspecific males with a naturally occurring component of the sword, an abbreviated lower caudal stripe. To investigate the possibility that the previously suggested pre-existing bias favouring a sword was merely an extension of a preference for this stripe specific to X. maculatus, whether female variable platyfish, X. variatus, also demonstrate a preference for males with swords was tested; this species has neither a sword nor any component of the sword. Female X. variatus were found to prefer conspecific males with swords to those without. This work suggests that X. variatus and X. maculatus share a preference favouring a sword, despite the lack of a sword in these species. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ID CRYPTIC FEMALE CHOICE; BEHAVIOR; GENITALIA; COPULATION; EVOLUTION;
   SELECTION; DIPTERA
AB The mating behaviour of Zorotypus barberi Gurney (Insecta: Zoraptera) involves courtship feeding and repeated mating. The male performs an elaborate sequence of pre-copulatory courtship, during which he secretes a liquid substance from the cephalic gland and uses it as a courtship gift to entice females to mate. The female allows the male to copulate with her, only after she has successfully obtained the gift. Females continue to assess the mate quality even after genitalic intromission has begun and mate rejection by females is common during copulation as well as during pre-copulatory courtship. The majority of prematurely terminated copulations occur before sperm are transferred. Mating pairs usually copulate three or more times in succession and the entire sequence of courtship is repeated prior to each copulation. Females that mated three or more times lay considerably more eggs than those mated only once or twice, suggesting that sufficient sperm supplies are required for females to achieve full fecundity. By copulating repeatedly with the same male, females could obtain courtship gifts at a greater rate than mating multiply with different males because the courtship duration with the same male decreases significantly after the first copulation. Observations on females that mated with multiple males suggest that such females may copulate repeatedly with a preferred male in order to dilute the sperm from inferior males and thus affect the paternity of offspring.

AB At least 10% of nests in a population of moorhens, Gallinula chloropus, at Peakirk, Cambridgeshire, received parasitic eggs ((X) over bar=1.7, range 1-6) laid by conspecific females. To determine whether hosts have behavioural mechanisms to counter intraspecific brood parasitism, realistic model eggs were introduced into nests during various stages of the host's laying period. All eggs placed in nests before the host had begun to lay were destroyed. All experimental eggs added after the fourth host egg had been laid were accepted. However, at earlier stages of the host's laying period, some host pairs responded to parasitism by deserting the clutch. None ejected the parasitic egg. Moorhens were most likely to desert the nest if the parasitic egg was added after they had laid only one egg, and the host response was independent of how different the experimental and host eggs looked. Moorhens were also more likely to desert in response to parasitism later in the season where there was more nesting vegetation available, and they had more alternative nesting sites. A model showed that when hosts are parasitized early in their laying period, it is advantageous for the hosts to desert and complete their clutch in a new nest. After the host has laid two or more eggs, it is better to accept parasitism because the cost of desertion exceeds the cost of parasitism.

AB Potential costs and benefits of colonial nesting in the maomao, Abudefduf abdominalis, were examined by quantifying multiple environmental and social factors associated with parental care and spawning in different group sizes. Egg predation time after experimental male removals was positively correlated with group size, indicating that reduction of egg predation is a primary benefit of colonial nesting in these populations. Parental males in small nesting groups (1-7 parental males) chased and experienced intrusions by diurnal egg predators more frequently than males in larger groups, indicating that egg loss was primarily due to predation by diurnal fish. Males in larger groups spawned more frequently than males in smaller groups, a result consistent with both the predation-reduction hypothesis and a female-preference model that suggests females prefer males in larger groups. There was no evidence that 'less-preferred' males nested adjacent to 'preferred' males to steal fertilizations. The primary cost to colonial nesting was reproductive interference by sneaking males. Spawning pairs experienced higher rates of sneaking and spawning interruptions when five or more pairs were present, independent of group size, The number of pairs spawning simultaneously in a colony was positively correlated with group size, Thus, the potential cost of spawning in larger groups was a function of spawning activity, and only indirectly related to group size.

AB Investment in vigilance with respect both to group foraging and distance to obstructive cover was studied in the teal. The effects of group size on vigilance level were examined after controlling for several potentially confounding variables. In a pair-wise analysis, investment in vigilance decreased with increasing group size. Distance to cover had a non-linear effect on vigilance; scan length was at its shortest at an intermediate distance and longest at the longest distance to obstructive cover. The association between group size and vigilance remained after controlling for the effect of distance to cover. Investment in vigilance also decreased with the proximity to neighbours. Group size per se did not affect the level of vigilance after controlling for the effect of neighbour distance, whereas neighbour distance had an effect of its own after controlling for group size and distance to cover.

TI WHY DO HUNTING CHEETAHS PREFER MALE GAZELLES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Cheetahs, Acinonyx jubatus, in the Serengeti National Park kill more male Thomson''s gazelles, Gazella thomsoni, than expected from the sex ratio of the local population. This paper examines whether behavioural differences between male and female gazelles predispose males to higher rates of predation. Cheetahs hunting groups of Thomson''s gazelles preferentially selected individuals that were positioned on the periphery of groups, were further from their nearest neighbours, were in areas of  high vegetation, were less vigilant and were either in small groups or on their own. As a result, male Thomson''s gazelles, which tended to concentrate on the periphery of groups, had greater nearest-neighbour distances, were less vigilant and were found in smaller groups, were more vulnerable than females and were preferentially selected from groups. There was no evidence that males were more vulnerable because they tended to concentrate in areas of high vegetation. Overall, gazelles in groups  were far less vulnerable to predation than solitary individuals and the fact that males spent so much more time alone than females was another factor contributing to their high risk of predation; although solitary males were actually better at escaping once chased by cheetahs than solitary females, the difference in escape ability was not sufficient to offset the high number of attacks experienced by males as a result of thier more solitary behaviour.

TI MATING STRATEGIES OF MALE FERAL GOATS - A PROBLEM IN OPTIMAL FORAGING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Among feral goats, Capra hircus, on the Isle of Rhum, Scotland, the highest ranking males are able to monopolize a disproportionate share of the access to females in oestrus. Since oestrous females are an unpredictable, patchily distributed resource, a male who is prevented from mating by more dominant rivals faces a choice between 910 staying on in the group in the expectation that, sooner or later, other females will come into oestrus and (2) leaving to search for a group that contains fewer dominant males. A model of the male''s decision is developed which shows that males adjust their willingness to join and leave groups in response both to the number of oestrous females they can expect to find in a group and to the number of competing males in the group. There is some evidence to suggest that the skill with which a male exploits the situation improves with age and experience.

TI FEEDING COMPETITION BETWEEN GRAZING RED DEER HINDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of social rank on the feeding behaviour of female red deer, Cervus elaphus L., on the Isle of Rhum, Scotland, was investigated. Hinds were less likely to approach and more likely to leave the vicinity of other individuals if these hinds were dominant to them. Movements aways by subordinates were more likely to involve a break from feeding. Feeding rate, as measured by bite rate, increased with distance from dominant neighbours, but was unaffected by the distance to subordinates. It  appears that aggressive interactions had little direct effect on access to food. Instead, it is suggested that feeding competition in red deer hinds is largely a passive process, operating through the avoidance of conflict by subordinates.

TI A MATERNAL CHEMOSIGNAL MAINTAINS PATERNAL BEHAVIOR IN THE BIPARENTAL
   CALIFORNIA MOUSE, PEROMYSCUS-CALIFORNICUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Relatively little is known about the proximate mechanisms underlying paternal behaviour in mammals. Paternal behaviour in the biparental California mouse, Peromyscus californicus, is maintained during the first 3 days postpartum by the male''s mate and by maternal excreta. Here it is reported that (1) maintenance of paternal responsiveness is specific to the male''s mate. Fathers exposed to excreta from their mates were significantly more likely to exhibit parental behaviour than fathers exposed to virgin or lactating female excreta, or no excreta. (2) Mere familiarity with a female was not sufficient to maintain paternal behaviour. (3) Maternal urine was sufficient to maintain paternal solicitude. Fathers given 100 .mu.l of maternal urine on their nares twice a day were parental compared to fathers similarly exposed to distilled water. (4) The maternal urinary chemosignal(s) was contained in the volatile fraction of maternal urine.

TI CAN FEMALE PREFERENCE EXPLAIN SEXUAL DICHROMATISM IN THE PIED
   FLYCATCHER, FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB How important female choice is for the evolution of male secondary sexual characteristics is controversial. Two field and one laboratory experiment, using the pied flycatcher, were performed to test the female choice aspect of sexual selection. In addition, non-manipulative data from 5 years are presented. The observational data suggest a slight preference for dark males by females but in field experiments in which males had territories at random sites (i.e. they did not choose a territory) or  the colour of concurrently arriving males was altered, there was no preference for darker ones. Similarly, oestradiol-treated females did not prefer black or brown males in the laboratory. Thus, there is little support for the idea that female choice has been an important mechanism in the evolution of sexual dichromatism in the pied flycatcher.

TI THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF A VOCAL SIGNAL - THE NEST-ASSOCIATED CHIT OF
   THE FEMALE RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD, AGELAIUS-PHOENICEUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Understanding the function of behaviour requires analysis of fitness costs and benefits, but this is difficult because methods of assessment are usually lacking. In this paper the results of an experimental analysis of costs and benefits of a vocal signal, the nest-associated call of the female red-winged blackbird are reported. Female red-winged blackbirds gave nest-associated calls during arrival and departure from their nests, and while on their nests. The intersexual ''Chit'' was the call most often given in these contexts, and was frequently given in answer to the songs of mates. To assess the potential cost of nest-associated calling, mock nests containing plaster eggs were placed at suitable nest sites. Nests accompanied by playback of tape-recorded Chit calls were depredated at higher rates than nests without playback. Mock nests were also used to assess the potential benefit of nest-associated calling. Nests accompanied by playback were more strongly defended against a simulated  predator by male red-winged blackbrids than nests without playback. To estimate the net benefit of nest-associated calling, the vocal behaviour of successful (produced at least one fledgling) and unsuccessful (nest depredated) females was compared. Reproductively successful females answered the songs of their mates with Chit calls from the nest more often than unsuccessful females. Nest-associated Chits thus appear to confer a net benefit on female red-winged blackbirds by maintaining the vigilance of males against nest predators.

TI RESPONSES OF YELLOW WARBLERS TO THE THREAT OF COWBIRD PARASITISM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Responses of yellow warblers, Dendroica petechia, to a model of a female brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater, and a fox sparrow, Passerella iliaca, control were tested during the nest-building, egg-laying, incubation and nestling stages of the nesting cycle. Testing pairs only once avoided the risk of habituation to models. Females rarely responded aggressively to models or showed distraction displays. Instead, a nest-protection behavior involving ''seet'' calling and a rush to sit in the  nest was observed, primarily in response to the cowbird model. Yearlings did not show this behavior as frequently as older or previously parasitized birds. Females gave fewer seet calls when they defended cryptic compared with exposed nests. They gave more seet calls and fewer ''chip'' calls in response to the cowbird model than the control. The frequency of seet calling by females was highest during egg laying when they were most susceptible to cowbird parasitism. Males responded infrequently to all models and were first to arrive in only 5% of trials.

TI BEHAVIORAL-CORRELATES OF UNCERTAIN PARENTAGE - MATE GUARDING AND NEST
   GUARDING BY EASTERN BLUEBIRDS, SIALIA-SIALIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Uncertain paternity through the potential for extra-pair copulations by females selects for the behaviour of male eastern bluebirds. Males are with fertile females more than non-fertile females; they stay closer to and follow fertile females more than non-fertile females. Reproductive competition through conspecific nest parasitism also occurs in eastern bluebirds (Gowaty and Karlin: Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol., 1984, 15, 91-95), and, by analogy to theories of uncertain paternity, uncertain  maternity was predicted to shape the behaviour of females. Therefore, the idea that nest guarding by eastern bluebirds occurs in ways consistent with protection of maternity was tested. Females, but not males, foraged for food closer to nestboxes during egg laying, when their nests were most vulnerable to conspecific egg dumping. Thus, this study provides the first systematic analysis of the guarding of nests from threat of conspecific parasitism. The tendency for males to guard females and for  females to guard nests was most exaggerated in those ecological situations where the threat of extra-pair copulation and conspecific egg dumping was greatest, namely when there were multiple nestboxes in a territory that acted as attractants to conspecific interlopers. Other possible explanations besides mate guarding for the observed behavioural variation in males, including copulatory access and guarding females from predation, are not consistent with the observations and were rejected as explantations for the behaviour. Other possible explanations besides nest guarding for the observed behavioural variation in females, including foraging for nesting material and increasing attention to nestlings, were also rejected.

TI MOTHERS DOMINANCE STATUS AND DIFFERENTIAL INVESTMENT IN REINDEER CALVES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In reindeer, Rangifer tarandus, calf weight loss during the winter decreased with increasing maternal dominance status among female, but not among male, calves. The observed differences in mother-calf relationships suggest that the sex-biased dependence of weight loss on maternal status is a consequence of the combined effect of (1) a positive correlation between maternal rank and the frequency with which a mother and her calf shared feeding sites (snow craters) and (2) the fact that female  calves fed more than males from craters shared with their mothers. The sex of the calf did not affect maternal weight loss. Subordinate cows lost the most weight during winter. These observations suggest that sharing a crater with offspring is not energetically costly to the mother.

TI TIME-STRESSED OYSTERCATCHERS, HAEMATOPUS-OSTRALEGUS, CAN INCREASE THEIR
   INTAKE RATE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study addresses the problem of the effects of time stress of the foraging performance of birds. Oystercatchers were kept under semi-natural conditions in a large outdoor aviary with an adjustable, tidal regime and a natural one-prey situation. The birds were put under stress by varying the durations of the low-water period. The birds could forage only during low water and when these periods were shortened to as little as one-third of the natural 5 or 6 h of lower water, the birds were able  to maintain their mean consumption per tide. To achieve this, they spent proportionally more time foraging during shorter low tides, shortened their searching time per prey item taken and decreased the time spent handling prey, especially the time spent on prey that was rejected and left unopened. As a result, intake rate during foraging increased when the duration of the low tide was shortened. Most individuals had peaks in their consumption rates at the beginning and end of the low-water  period, rather than having decelerating satiation curves. In tests with tides of unpredictable durations, the birds showed large variations in their tidal consumption. The consumption at a given tide was then correlated with the consumption deficit built up during the foregoing tides. This strategy ensured that mean consumption over a long period of such unpredictable tides was the same as during a period of regular predictable tides.

TI KIN RECOGNITION IN THE ANT RHYTIDOPONERA-CONFUSA .1. ENVIRONMENTAL ODOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relative contribution of genetic and environmental components to the colony-specific recognition odour was assessed for the ant Rhytidoponera confusa, using an aggression assay. Colonies maintained in the laboratory for 6 months were significantly less aggressive to each other than they were to colonies that had been collected from the field within the previous 48 h. Colonies tested 12-24 h after collection from the field showed significantly more aggression against laboratory ants than did the same colonies after they had been kept in the laboratory for 4-5 weeks. Both results indicate the environmental odours can contribute the colony odour. Nestmates supplied with different diets and nest materials for 4-5 weeks were attacked more than the controls. Though slight, the increase in aggression was significant. This suggests that environmental odours, though significant when odour differences are extreme enough, may nevertheless be less important than genetic odours in nature.  This and other studies suggest this pattern may be common in social insects generally.

TI SUGGESTED EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGNS FOR SONG PLAYBACKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In studies of bird song, experimental designs and statistical analyses are often inappropriate for the hypotheses being tested. Frequently, only one playback or tutor stimulus is used to test a number of subjects, and the repeated samples of that single replicate are then analysed statistically as though the samples themselves were replicates. Proper experimental design demands that both the population of subjects and the ''population'' of song stimuli be sampled adequately. Several designs  commonly used for playback or tutoring experiments are illustrated, and changes in design are suggested that would increase the number of independent samples and would thus improve the reliability and external validity (i.e. generalizability) of the experimental work.

TI SEX-RATIO MANIPULATION, MATERNAL INVESTMENT AND BEHAVIOR DURING
   CONCURRENT PREGNANCY AND LACTATION IN HOUSE MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To determine the impact of concurrent pregnancy and lactation on reproduction in house mice, Mus musculus, the reproductive performances of primiparous inbred mice (Balb/c bom) were examined. Data on litter size and composition, and birth weights were recorded for 117 first litters and 29 second litters of dams, which were impregnated during postpartum oestrus. Twelve pregnant and 13 nonpregnant dams, together with their litters and feeders, were weighed daily during lactation. Activity budgets were taken of 10 dams in each group. Pregnant dams increased their food intake and withdrew milk earlier than non-pregnant ones. In addition, postpartum-conceived litters contained significantly heavier and fewer pups at birth than first litters and the sex ratio shifted in favour of males. Since male house mouse embryos are known to suffer more severely than females from nutritional stress, it is concluded that the sex ratio variation is not due to energy shortage during concurrent  pregnancy and lactation. Rather, it may be attributed to adaptive maternal manipulation, because postpartum-conceived pups will be heavier at weanig than other ones and males might benefit more strongly from being heavy at weaning than females. Finally, pregnant dams devoted more time to maternal care than did non-pregnant ones during the last 6 days of lactation. This contradicts the results on milk yield, if a direct proportionality of nursing time and amount of ejected milk is assumed, but is in agreement with the expected differences in maternal motivation of the dams.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The high population density of vocalizing males of the Puerto Rican treefrog Eleutherodactylus coqui in their natural habitat can lead to call overlap, which may interfere with the function of the call. Simulations of groups of calling males suggest that a given male can maximize the effectiveness of each call by actively avoiding acoustic overlap with at most two of its nearest neighbours. Analysis of vocal patterns of natural groups of frogs support this hypothesis: 14 of the 18 frogs tested actively avoided acoustic overlap with no more than two neighbour (one avoided acoustic overlap with three neighbours) while three frogs exhibited active call-jamming with one of their neighbours. Moreover, cross-correlograms of calling patterns between all pairs of frogs in a groups were used to infer dynamic chorus structures. Overlap avoidance behaviour is discussed in terms of reproductive success and predator evasion.

TI SEXUAL SELECTION ON MALE BODY SIZE AND MATING-BEHAVIOR IN AMERICAN
   TOADS, BUFO-AMERICANUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mating behaviour of B. americanus was observed from 1985 to 1987. The population contained 38-45 males and 11-26 females, depending on the year. The breeding season of this ''explosive breeder'' usually encompassed less than 48 h. Male reproductive success varied from zero to two matings per season and zero to an estimated 15,126 zygotes per season. All females mated once per season and variation in their zygote production was estimated to be 4017-11 624 ztgotes per season. Body length explained 76% of the variation in zygote production of females. However, male body length was only weakly correlated with mating success in two of three seasons, and with zygote production in one of three seasons. Male arm length was predicted to correlate with male mating success because longer arms should facilitate remaining clasped to females when challenged by rival males. However, mating males did not differ from non-mating males in arm length, and the relationship between arm length and body length was the same for the sexes. Various male behaviours were measured using focal-animal sampling but only call rate correlated with male mating success. The pattern of size dimorphism (females larger than males) is consistent with the observed sex-specific relationships between reproductive success and body size.

TI EFFECTS OF SEX-RATIO MANIPULATION ON TERRITORIALITY AND SPAWNING SUCCESS
   OF MALE PUPFISH, CYPRINODON-PECOSENSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sex ratio of Cyprinodon pecosensis was manipulated by varying the number of females but not of males. This resulted in some subordinate males changing their breeding tactics from satellites to territorials. The spawning success of breeding males was directly related, and the intensity of male-male competition was inversely related, to the number of available females. Time-budget data indicated a tradeoff between courtship and agonistic behavior. In the male-biased treatment, males engaged  in a greater number of agonists interactions and fewer courtship bouts; conversely, in the female-biased treatment coutrship behavior was more frequent than aggression. A greater proportion of males adopted the satellite breeding tactic in the male-biased and even-sex-ratio treatments. Smaller, competitively inferior males were most sensitive to changes in the sex ratio. In the female-biased treatment, with an increase in mating opportunities and a decrease in the level of male-male competition for females, average mating success increased, more males were able to defend territories, and some satellite individuals were able to adopt the territorial breeding tactic. Temporal or spatial changes in the operational sex ratio of a population may have profound effects on the dynamics of the breeding system by affecting the proportion of males adopting primary and secondary breeding tactics, variance in reproductive success, and intensity of sexual selection.

TI PATERNITY AND PATERNAL CARE IN THE SWALLOW, HIRUNDO-RUSTICA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Paternal care in the monogamous swallow, Hirundo rustica, measured in terms of frequency of feeding of young, was positively related to the certainty of paternity. Male parental care increased with the absolute number of pair copulations and decreased with the absolute and relative number of extra-pair copulations by his mate. Nearly identical results were obtained using either relative or absolute number of male feedings as a measure of the intensity of parental care. Male swallows apparently estimated their certainty of paternity from the interest that neighbouring males were taking in their mates during the fertile period. When the number of extra-pair copulations involving their mates was experimentally increased, males significantly decreased their feeding rates compared with controls. Paternal care was not related to several measures of male quality (body condition, arrival time, mite infection, song rate, or mate guarding rate).

TI THE AGONISTIC AND SEXUAL FUNCTIONS OF VOCALIZATIONS OF MALE BROWN-HEADED
   COWBIRDS, MOLOTHRUS-ATER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Functional analyses of three vocalizations of male brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, are presented and it is shown that two of these function as songs. Perched song (PS) is given by stationary birds and is used over short distances in male-male aggression and female courtship. The ''flight whistle'' (FW) is a multisyllabic, usually pure tone, vocalization and the ''single syllable flight call'' (SS) a monosyllabic pure tone. FWs and SSs are given occasionally by perched males and  repetitively by flying males. Field playbacks of FWs showed that male cowbirds responded in the agonistic way most passerines respond to playback of conspecific song. Playbacks of the female''s chatter call demonstrated that males of all three subspecies use FWs and SSs, but almost never PSs, to communicate with a female as they approach her. Thus FWs and SSs are used to communicate over long distances with both males and females. FWs are also used in one critical short-distance context as they  are significantly more likely than PSs to be given just before copulations in nature, at least in our western study area [USA]. By contrast, studies of captive eastern cowbirds showed that PSs regularly precede copulations whereas FWs rarely do so. These different results for western and eastern birds may be an artefact of captivity and/or a result of geographical variation in behaviour.

TI DIET-SELECTION ECOLOGY OF TROPICALLY AND TEMPERATELY ADAPTED HONEY-BEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Colonies of tropically adapted (Africanized) honey bees had greater numbers and higher percentages of pollen foragers than did temperately adapted (European) honey bees. European colonies had greater overall foraging activity. The number of pollen gatherers in Africanized nests was greater throughout the daily foraging cycle, and was especially high early in the morning when pollen was most abundant. Africanized colonies fielded more pollen collectors even when levels of stimuli which are known to regulate pollen foraging were altered experimentally. Collectively, the foraging patterns resulted in larger stores of pollen in Africanized honey bee nests, while European bee nests typically had larger honey and nectar caches. In mixed nests composed of equal portions of adults of each bee ecotype, foraging patterns were similar for ecotypes within a colony. The behavioural root of differences in resource gathering appears to lie with the nurse bees and foragers of a colony, not with the brood type. Diet selection differences are probably influenced strongly by the climatological constraints which regulate the survival and reproductive capacities of these two bee ecotypes.

TI VARIATION IN BADGE SIZE IN MALE HOUSE SPARROWS PASSER-DOMESTICUS -
   EVIDENCE FOR STATUS SIGNALING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relation of patterns of variation in badge size to dominance was studied in male house sparrows, Passer domesticus. Males with large badges were more dominant in winter flocks, irrespective of age, body size and body condition index. The frequency of attacks was higher with increasing similarity of badges of two contestants. Male house sparrows were more frequently engaged in attacks with males having a similar badge size when they had large badges than when they had small ones. Badge  size did not change consistently with age. Breeding territory owners approached closer to, and moved less frequently in response to, a house sparrow model with a small badge than to one with a large badge. These results are consistent with a status signalling function of badge size variation in house sparrows.

TI RECRUITMENT TO FOOD IN BLACK VULTURES - EVIDENCE FOR FOLLOWING FROM
   COMMUNAL ROOSTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experimental and observational evidence from a 5-year study of a partially marked population of black vultures, Coragyps atratus, suggests that individuals can find food by following others from overnight roosting groups. Natural food sources usually lasted long enough for recruitment to occur. Black vultures formed larger roosting groups and had enhanced second-day recruitment during winter, when their main food source was least abundant. Successful foragers returned to experimental food  sources on subsequent days and generally preceded new arrivals. Arrivals at bait were clumped on days of discovery and second days, but incoming groups were larger on second days and highly skewed towards early arrivals. In general, adults arrived at baited sites earlier than young adults and juveniles. During natural roost departures, adults were as likely to depart at the head of departing groups as at the rear, while young were concentrated in the rear. Birds removed experimentally from the  population long enough to be naive about the location of food followed others from the roost when reintroduced. Control adults (birds caught and handled but not restrained for long) were not concentrated in the rear of roost-departing groups, as were experimental adults. Juveniles tended to follow regardless of recent experience. These results suggest that roost attendance facilitates foraging for black vultures; these roosts probably function as information centres.

TI THE ORIENTATION BEHAVIOR OF ANOSMIC PIGEONS IN FRANKFURT AM, GERMANY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to test the olfactory hypothesis of homing, experiments were performed with birds that were deprived of olfactory information during displacement as well as at the release site. They wore nasal plugs until, immediately before release, the local anaesthetic Gingicain was sprayed into their nasal cavities. Of the orientation parameters, the vector lengths, homeward components and vanishing intervals were not affected. The treatment slightly increased the deviation of the mean directions  from home and delayed the homing times. Both effects, however, were inconsistent. In the majority of tests, initial orientation appeared to be totally unaffected; a significant difference in mean direction was found in only three of the 20 releases. The homing times yielded a similar picture. This suggests that for our Frankfurt pigeons, odours seem to be factors of only minor importance that are only rarely used. These rare cases, the differences from the findings at other lofts and their  implications for the navigational system are discussed.

TI NON-PARENTAL NEST ATTENDANCE IN THE BARN SWALLOW (HIRUNDO, RUSTICA) -
   HELPING OR HARASSMENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB During a long-term study of barn swallows in New York''s Adirondacks [USA], we observed many instances of third birds attending active nests. Most non-parental attendance involved unmated adult males that were not closely related to those they attended. There were no significant differences in the reproductive success of attended and unattended nests. Attendants showed little of the cooperative behaviour reported in earlier studies of other barn swallow populations. At Cranberry Lake, nest  attendants behaved more often in ways that were detrimental to one or both breeders (e.g. attempting copulation with females, or committing infanticide). Our results indicate that non-parental nest attendance may be a competitive strategy by which males gain information about, or access to, breeding sites and females. If this conclusion is correct, then the major difference between barn swallows and other species with more cooperative attendant (helper) systems may be that barn swallows live in  groups of non-relatives, where there are few indirect benefits to be gained by cooperation, while more cooperative species can interact socially with kin.

TI VARIABILITY IN ATTRACTIVENESS OF MALE FIELD CRICKETS (ORTHOPTERA,
   GRYLLIDAE) TO FEMALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In experiments using sets of 12 individually caged male field crickets (Gryllus veletis and G. pennsylvanicus) suspended above pitfall traps in an outdoor enclosure, each male attracted zero-nine females over a 4-day period in which 48-60 females were released. Male age was significantly positively correlated with the number of females attracted in both species, whereas male body size, time spent calling and level of infestation with gregarines (protozoan gut parasites) were unrelated to  male attractiveness. Older male G. pennsylvanicus (at least 15 days past adult moult) also attracted significantly more females than did younger males (7-9 days after adult moult) when pitfall traps and cages were set in the field, allowing naturally occurring females to fall into the traps. Because males were kept from contacting each other in the experiments examining correlates of attractiveness, females appeared to be actually choosing older males, rather than indirectly relying on the results of male-male competition.

TI THE RECOGNITION OF SOCIAL ALLIANCES BY VERVET MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) are significantly more likely to threaten a particular individual if they have previously been involved in a fight with that individual''s close kin. They thus show evidence of recognizing that certain individuals associate regularly with each other. Vervets over the age of 3 years are also significantly more likely to threaten a particular individual if that individual''s close kin and their own close kin have previously been involved in a fight. It therefore seems possible that adult vervets can recognize, from experience, that certain sorts of relationships share similar characteristics, regardless of the individuals involved.

TI CHEMORECEPTIVE AND BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES OF THE COMMON LIZARD
   LACERTA-VIVIPARA TO SNAKE CHEMICAL-DEPOSITS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behavioural cues were used to assay the capacity of common lizards to detect chemical deposits of snakes. The lizards were observed in cages that had been previously inhabited either by one of two species of snake that feed on lizards (the viper Vipera berus and the smooth snake Coronella austriaca), or the grass snake (Natrix natrix), which does not feed on lizards. As a control, the lizards were tested both in a clean cage and in one sprayed with a pungent odorant. The lizards responded  to the snakes'' chemicals by increased tongue-flick rates, with the highest rates being given in response to the deposits of their predators. The chemosensory examination of the snakes'' odours induced a shift in general behaviour in response to the predator, but not to the non-predator chemical cues. This behavioural response consisted mainly of a disruption of the locomotor patterns. Our findings strongly suggest that lizards detected and distinguished between the chemicals deposited by three  species of snake. Behavioural performances were highly variable among individual lizards in all trials, but the relative scores of individuals tended to be similar in response to different stimuli.

AB Bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus, and field voles, Microtus agrestis, redistribute food hoards and alter the location of their activity upon the introduction of a foreign conspecific in laboratory experiments. This behaviour showed geographic variation in C. glareolus but no clear geographic variation in M. agrestis; north Swedish cyclic C. glareolus were repelled by the new animals while southern non-cyclic C. glareolus were attracted. There were no differences between animals from various population phases at the same locality. The geographic differences were retained in laboratory-born animals kept in an abnormal social environment. Other studies have demonstrated similar differences in M. agrestis. Cyclic voles may be negatively affected by density-related stimuli while non-cyclic ones may instead gather in environments that are fairly safe from predators.

TI INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ADULT MALE AND INFANT YELLOW BABOONS
   (PAPIO-C-CYNOCEPHALUS) IN TANZANIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Study of interactions between adult male and young infant yellow baboons (papio c. cynocephalus) revealed that the males that interacted most with infants were resident adults, who might have fathered the infants, but that newcomer males who could not be fathers never did so. Males carried infants in several circumstances, including triadically during interaction with other males, and did so more when high-ranking and newcomer males were nearby. Their triadic interactions when carrying  infants also tended to be against high-rankers and newcomers, so that the infant carrier in such interactions was more often the subordinate of the pair. This study agrees with others that males'' access to infants is mediated through relations with the mothers, and their relations with particular infants include both protection and use in agonistic buffering. It is suggested that buffering is a learned behaviour which exploits other animals'' wariness of males who are protecting infants.

TI SUCKLING IN RATS EXTENDED BY CONTINUOUS LIVING WITH DAMS AND THEIR

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To evaluate the role of the dam and littermates in weaning, rats were separated from their biological mothers, beginning at 21 days of age, and housed with a succession of dams and their 16-21-day-old litters. Sucklng persistence was evaluated every 5 days until rats reached 70 days of age or no longer suckled. Rats housed in such a preweaning environment continued to suckle well past the normal age of weaning. Specifically, 50% suckled until day 55, and 15% suckled until they were 70 days of  age and sexually active. In addition, the interactions among three dams and their litters composed of 16-21-day-old pups and a 45-50-day-old rat that had been housed with similar litters were analysed from time-lapse video-recordings. Experimental rats routinely suckled in the nest and withdrew milk from the dam, but did so only when most of the younger pups had already attached. These data suggest that the maternal and social milieu plays a role in the maintenance of suckling behaviour.

TI THE GEOMETRY OF PREDATOR AVOIDANCE BY THE BLUE-CRAB, CALLINECTES-SAPIDUS
   RATHBUN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A model is proposed to explain the pattern of escape orientation of blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus Rathbun) in the intertidal zone of sandy beaches. The model states that a crab should select the escape heading that maximizes its distance offshore before being intercepted by a pursuing predator. Predictions of the model were evaluated with observations of escape responses elicited by my approach. Fleeing crabs swam offshore, but the heading they chose was influenced by the approach heading of the observer. The distribution of crab escape headings as a function of observer approach heading was symmetrical about the onshore-offshore axis. Crab escape heading was independent of the approach distance (distance between the observer and the crab at the start of the escape response). Finally, crabs did not assess relative speed (crab speed/predator speed) when selecting an escape heading. By testing the predictions of the model it is demonstrated that the escape orientation of blue crabs in the intertidal zone is a compromise between swimming away from a potential enemy and swimming offshore for refuge. The assumptions of the model are discussed and the use of models in understanding the dynamics of predator avoidance is considered.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) fast during the pupping and mating season; they are polygynous and throughout their breeding range they occupy a variety of habitats. Time allocation patterns are consistent with the fact that grey seal energy reserves are limited during the breeding season. Variations in the activity budgets of seals in different types of habitat appear to be determined by the nature of the terrain occupied. This behavioral flexibility may well have been an important feature in the evolution of the species.

TI INTERACTION BETWEEN ACQUIRED PREFERENCES AND DEVELOPING PREDISPOSITIONS
   DURING IMPRINTING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Preferences of domestic chicks were studied either at .apprx. 2 h or .apprx. 24 h after exposure to a red box or a stuffed jungle fowl. Preferences of the chicks were measured in a simultaneous choice test involving these 2 stimuli. When tested at .apprx. 2 h, chicks preferred the object to which they had previously been exposed. Chicks tested at .apprx. 24 h showed a significantly greater preference for the jungle fowl than those tested at .apprx. 2 h, regardless of the training stimulus. Birds that had been placed in  a running wheel and exposed to diffuse light also showed an increasing preference for the fowl over time when tested in the same manner. These results may be accounted for in terms of an interaction between 2 processes, a developing predisposition for the fowl on the 1 hand and a preference acquired through learning on the other.

TI FEMALE DIMORPHISM AND MATING-BEHAVIOR IN A DAMSELFLY, ISCHNURA-RAMBURI -
   FEMALES MIMICKING MALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Females of the damselfly Ischnura ramburi exhibit a simple genetic color dimorphism in which 1-form is cryptic (heteromorph), and the other closely resembles the more conspicuously colorful males (andromorph). Andromorphs also mimic male behavior in interactions with males. Consequently they copulate half as often as do heteromorphs, which may give them a frequency-dependent selective advantage. Assuming that females need only mate once, excessive copulations, which average 3 h in duration, waste time for heteromorphs and may expose them to increased predation. The peculiar biology and mating behavior of ischnurans provides a possible evolutionary context for this mimicry. The polymorphism is probably balanced by a frequency-independent selective disadvantage suffered by the more conspicuous andromorphs, through increased predation.

AB Observations of adult and subadult yellow baboons (P. cynocephalus) revealed class differences in spatial pattern both during movement and when at rest. Males tended to spend slightly more time on the periphery than did females and travelled more at the front. Positions of males reflected their association with females: younger and older adults were more peripheral; while prime adults were focal. Positions of adult females reflected their reproductive state: mothers of young infants were gregarious; pregnant females were peripheral and travelled at the sides. Lower-ranking females were also more peripheral. These patterns are discussed in relation to male and female reproductive differences and to predation.

AB The nest attendance and activity of kittiwake pairs were monitored during incubation using radioisotopes. Overall, females performed 54% of incubation and males the remainder. Pairs differed consistently in their methods of sharing incubation. Partners met only briefly when they changed over incubation duties, alternating rapidly during early incubation, but later only about twice each day, these changeovers occurring usually after dawn and in the late afternoon. Less consistent incubation attendance occurred in males and was often compensated for by the females. Detailed changeover patterns showed considerable irregularity, both within and between pairs, apparently unrelated to environmental parameters.

TI SOCIAL TRANSMISSION OF BEHAVIORAL TRADITIONS IN A CORAL-REEF FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Traditional behaviors involve the non-genetic transmission of social information across age classes or generations. French grunts (Haemulon flavolineatum) exhibit social traditions of daytime schooling sites and twilight migration routes. Individuals transplanted to new schooling sites and allowed to follow residents at the new sites used the new migration routes and returned to the new sites in the absence of resident fish. Control fish with no opportunity to learn showed no such  directionality or return. This is the 1st demonstration of apparent pre-cultural behavior in free-living fish. Additional classes of behavior and taxonomic groups in which pre-cultural activities are likely to have evolved are suggested.

TI THERMAL LIMITATIONS TO ESCAPE RESPONSES IN DESERT GRASSHOPPERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The desert-dwelling grasshopper T. pallidipennis avoids intolerably-high environmental temperatures by resting under shrubs during the day. Attacks by predators elicit escape responses consisting of leaps or short flights into open areas, followed by periods of immobility during which the animals relay on crypsis. Observations and computer models indicate that the tolerable durations of immobile periods are very short, owing to high heat loads. They are sufficient to avoid the most abundant predators, the lizards Cnemidophorus tigris and Sceloporus magister. The short duration of immobility makes T. pallidipennis vulnerable to attacks by birds such as Say''s phoebe (Sayornis sayii), which sit in cool air and waits for grasshoppers to reveal themselves by movement.

TI STRUCTURE OF GELADA BABOON REPRODUCTIVE UNITS .2. SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS
   BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE FEMALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The structure of social relationships among post-puberty gelada (T. gelada) females are analysed to determine what factors influence the way in which females distribute their social time among their potential interactees. Females suffer from constraints on the amount of social time they have available and are forced to become increasingly selective in their choice of interactees as unit size increases. They seldom interact with individuals who are not their immediate matrilineal relatives. Within these relationships, there is little to distinguish qualitatively between relationships that involve frequent interaction and those that are more rarely serviced, suggesting that females are aware of who their immediate relatives are even if they only rarely interact with them because of the limited time they have available. These findings are interpreted in the light of the functional significance of coalitions in terms of a female''s reproductive output.

TI PREDATORY SUCCESS IN THE WATER STICK INSECT - THE ROLE OF VISUAL AND
   MECHANICAL STIMULATIONS AFTER MOLTING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The more foreleg femur and claw movements that a water stick insect, R. linearis, performs during the 4-h period following a molt, the higher will be its subsequent strike efficiency. The amount of movement is influenced by external factors such as the presence of prey or light. The absence of visual cues during the post-molt periods impairs subsequent performance, but not as much as the absence of both visual and mechanical cues. Perception of mechanical stimuli only during that period subsequently influences the accuracy of simple type strikes elicited when prey is near the forelegs; perception of visual stimuli subsequently improves the accuracy of more complex predatory movements.

   MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB A range of social interactions was investigated between mice which differed in their degree of relatedness and familiarity. Unfamiliar half siblings (sharing paternity only) differed significantly from unfamiliar non-siblings (sharing neither mother nor father) in their tendency to perform aggression-related interactions and in the amount of passive body contact they showed. Differences between half and full siblings in patterns of interaction appeared to be due to differing degrees of familiarity with companions. Kinship effects disappeared completely when animals were allowed to become familar. The functional significance of the familiarity and kinship effects found are discussed including differences between the sexes in the types of interaction showing kinship effects. Differences between adult and juvenile mice are also briefly discussed.

TI BURROWING AND FEEDING-BEHAVIOR IN THE RAT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Little information is available on the burrowing activity of the brown rat, R. norvegicus (Berk.), in the field or laboratory. Three groups of rats (laboratory, hybrid and wild) were studied in a semi-natural environment. The observational area was entirely enclosed by a steel net and comprised a channel (22 m long) fed by Po river water and a terrestrial area of 50 m2. The development of the burrow systems and their structure were not significantly different in the 3 groups of rats, and were comparable to those reported by other authors. The results suggest that the complexity of the burrow systems and pathways is connected to the population density of the rat group under study. An intense predation on freshwater mollusks was observed. The probability of prey being carried into the food-sites and burrows for consumption was related to prey size.

TI REARING OTHER PEOPLES YOUNG - BROOD-MIXING IN THE SHELDUCK

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The mixing of ducklings from different broods, in several species of waterfowl, involves care of offspring other than the parents'' own. In the eider, Somateria mollissima, this behavior appears to be of benefit, in terms of increased adult and duckling survival, to both donor and recipient parents, but in the shelduck, T. tadorna, brood-mixing appears not to be advantageous. Dominant males tended to lose ducklings to more subordinate ones but there was no significant difference between donor and recipient parents in the number of their own offspring reared to fledging. The apparent lack of any advantage in brood-mixing suggests that the behavior might be a consequence of high brood density and that in the shelduck brood defense is adapted to low density.

AB The profitability (energy content per second of handling time) of cockles, C. edule, to oystercatchers, H. ostralegus, increases with cockle size. In accordance with the predictions of optimal foraging theory, oystercatchers selected the more profitable (i.e., larger) cockles. The percentage abandoned at the different sites increased with the mean size taken, suggesting that attacks on large cockles were less likely to be successful. Oystercatchers use some visual cues to find prey during the day, but use only tactile cues at hight. They take smaller prey at night, with a flesh content 25% less than those taken during the day.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF MATING-BEHAVIOR IN THE PREPUBERAL RAM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Several components of mating behavior were observed in ram lambs between birth and weaning at 8 wk. Mounting was most common, followed by nosing, flehmen and pawing. Ewe lambs exhibited the same behaviors, but fewer nosings and pawings. True sexual activity began between 9 and 20 wk, with 1st ejaculation at about 27-30 kg and 140-180 days of age. Initially, behaviors were expressed in the order nose, nudge, paw, flehmen, lack, mount and ejaculate. With increasing age, flehmen occurred earlier in the sequence and pawing later. Competitive order was related to mounting activity age at 1st ejaculation and total ejaculations. Ram lambs rely heavily on the sense of smell during their early sexual encounters. With increasing age and experience the vomeronasal system assumes considerable importance. Changes in the behavioral sequence need to be considered when testing libido during the puberal period.

TI A COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTS OF TESTOSTERONE ON AGGRESSIVE RESPONSES BY
   THE DOMESTIC CHICK TO THE HUMAN HAND AND TO A LARGE SPHERE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In young male chicks a single injection of testosterone oenanthate leads to a long-lasting facilitation of behavior patterns related to adult attack, courtship and copulation. The same responses, in particular facilitated pecking, may be evoked, with a similar time course of facilitation and subsequent waning, by a human hand or a white featureless sphere. The dose-response curve to the androgen is also similar for these 2 objects. A very simple stimulus thus appears to be capable of evoking at least 1 major component of aggressive behavior, as well as other responses normally directed to conspecifics. Pecking of the sphere increases within 4-7 h of a 2nd injection of the androgen, given after facilitation due to the 1st has disappeared; the 1st requires 48-72 h to become effective. This rapid effect is not dependent on the age of the animal, nor on prior experience of pecking the sphere, indeed this causes marked habituation of all response to the sphere, whether or not response is facilitated by testosterone during the initial experience. It appears to result from central priming, perhaps by a process similar to the reversal of refractoriness to central androgen implants by prior systemic priming with testosterone, which has been previously reported for adult castrates.

AB The geometric structure and sensory bases of social aggregates in larvae of the clawed frog, X. laevis, were studied using photographic data interpreted with the aid of a computerized image analyzer. The system records positional data from photographs and uses this information to assess extent of parallel orientation between tadpoles that are nearest neighbours, distance over which significant parallel orientation is maintained (interactive distance) and extent of clumping or evenness of individuals. Under all density, size and illumination conditions, tadpoles show a highly significant tendency to line up parallel (0.degree. between neighbors) and, to a lesser extent, antiparallel (180.degree. between neighbors) to their nearest neighbor. Tadpoles in the light show a much greater tendency to orient parallel to nearest neighbors than in the dark. The tendency to orient parallel to nearest neighbors increases slightly with increasing tadpole size and density. In the light, tadpoles have an interactive distance of approximately 2 body lengths; in the dark, approximately 1 body length. Interactive distance shows a slight increase with decreasing tadpole density. Interactive distance is proportional to tadpole size. Spacing between tadpoles is random, but there is a weak tendency toward increased evenness with increasing tadpole size and density; tadpoles in the light position themselves more evenly than in the dark. Xenopus tadpoles may use both visual and lateral line input to school. Lateral line input is presumably necessary for maintaining some degree of parallel orientation in the dark and is augmented by visual information in the light.

TI BEHAVIORAL-CHANGES OF PROTOGYNOUS SEX REVERSAL IN A CORAL-REEF FISH IN
   THE LABORATORY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In the group living, protogynous coral reef fish, A. squamipinnis (Peters), males differed from females behaviorally by performing and receiving 5 movement patterns at different rates. Following removal of a male from laboratory social groups, 1 female changed sex. As sex reversal proceeded, the sex-reversing female progressively increased the rate of performance and reception of behaviors distinguishing the sexes. Nose rushes increased in rate beginning 2 days after male removal. U-swims and 3rd-dorsal-spine erections began to increase 4 and 11 days, respectively, after male removal. It took 3-4 wk for the sex-changing fish to perform these behaviors at the full male rate. An analysis of behavioral rates for all individuals in the social group before and after male removal revealed that the behavioral changes of sex reversal were displayed only by 1 female in the group and did not occur in control groups. A full description is provided of movement patterns and analogies drawn between the development of U-swims by the adult sex-changing fish and the behavioral ontogeny of juveniles in other species.

   OR ENDOGENOUS THYROXINE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Recently transformed adult tiger salamanders that had never resided on land were treated with increasing, alternate-day injections of thyroxine [T4] or single injections of particular dosages of this hormone. In all cases control salamanders received equivalent volumes of saline on a similar schedule. In both experiments, subjects treated with T4 displayed significant levels of terrestrial-substrate preference in a moisture-gradient apparatus. Saline-treated controls never emerged from the water. Animals that received single T4 treatments also displayed heightened levels of land-directed locomotor activity. Plasma was collected from salamanders displaying spontaneous land preference and others displaying water preference. Radioimmunoassay for T4 indicated that salamanders that had moved to, and resided upon, a terrestrial substrate some time subsequent to metamorphosis had significantly higher plasma levels of this hormone than did animals preferring to remain submerged. T4 stimulates and possibly maintains emergence from water and terrestrial preference in newly transformed tiger salamanders and this hormone stimulates a locomotor activity component associated with the movement of formerly aquatic adults to the terrestrial habitat.

AB Sexual selection on males as the variance in numbers of mates per male and how the intensity of this selection is affected by male sexual behavior, female choice, sex ratio and modes of sperm precedence are examined. Darwin''s conception of sexual selection is discussed. For systems of single-male paternity, the intensity of total selection on male reproductive success probably equals the intensity of natural selection on female fertility, times the sex ratio, plus the intensity of sexual selection on males. The absolute intensity of sexual selection may be unaffected by the system of sperm precedence. [A model is presented.].

TI AGGRESSION, TERRITORIALITY, AND MATING-BEHAVIOR IN NORTH-AMERICAN
   TREEFROGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior of Hyla versicolor was examined during 4 breeding seasons. Calling males are territorial and use the mating call as a cue in maintaining their spacing. Males defend territories using encounter calls and ultimately, fighting. Males that lose vocal interactions or fights sometimes cease calling and remain silent within the territory of other, dominant males. Females approach males at their calling sites, initiate amplexus with a nudge and remain in amplexus for more than 4 h. Such behavior occasionally allows subordinate males to obtain use of a calling perch. The behavior described for H. versicolor is compared with that seen in 8 other species of North American Hyla [H. chrysoscelis, H. squirella, H. cinerea, H. regilla, H. crucifer, H. femoralia, H. cadaverina and H. andersoni].

TI NOD-SWIM DISPLAY OF MALE GREEN-WINGED TEAL (ANAS-CRECCA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Nod-swimming is a frequent and conspicuous display performed by males during the social courtship of green-winged teal. The function of nod-swimming is discussed and various features of the display between the allopatric American [A. c. carolinensis] and European races [A. c. crecca] are compared. Cine films of social courtship were analyzed to determine the situations in which nod-swimming is given, the effects it may have on other birds, the relationship between nod-swimm frequency and dominance status and the temporal association and nod-swimming with other displays. Nod-swimming is much reduced in the European, as compared to the American, race and one of the important functions of nod-swimming in both races may be appeasement.

AB The Harderian gland of the golden hamster shows pronounced sexual dimorphism in histology and products. Sexually experienced or inexperienced males were attracted to fresh smears of female and male Harderian gland as opposed to a control. Female smears were investigated significantly more than male smears. Control smears of quadriceps muscle proved unattractive. Neither category of male preferred estrus to mid-cycle Harderian smears, and attractiveness did not correlate with protoporphyrin content. Males were unattracted to protoporphyrin solution. Cephalic olfactory cues, such as Harderian secretions, may be of importance in tunnel-dwelling rodents.

TI RHYTHMICAL STEREOTYPIES IN NORMAL HUMAN INFANTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Naturalistic, longitudinal observations of 20 normal infants biweekly during their 1st yr showed that they performed a great quantity and variety of rhythmical and highly stereotyped behaviors. Movement patterns [47] are described involving the legs and feet; the head and face; the arms, hands and fingers; and the whole torso in various postures. These behaviors showed developmental regularities and constancy of form and distribution. Groups of stereotypies involving particular parts of the body or postures had characteristic ages of onset, peak performance and decline. The onset of particular stereotypy groups was highly correlated with motor development. Rhythmical stereotypies apparently are manifestations of incomplete cortical control of endogenous patterning in maturing neuromuscular pathways.

Fewer pups were retrieved and more returned to the nest by themselves as the pups matured. The female''s latency to retrieve pups also increased as the pups grew older. Due to retrieval by both patients and the spontaneous return of pups, few pups were left outside the nest after scattering.

AB Calves were either isolated, spatially but not visually, or group-reared for 8 mo. and then kept together. Rank orders based on competitive interactions were similar at 8 and 20 mo. Almost all group-reared animals were higher in rank than all isolation-reared animals. The most frequent nearest neighbor associations were between group-reared animals, especially those from the same rearing group. Also frequent at 8 mo. were associations between calves which were isolated in adjacent pens. Isolation-reared animals associated infrequently with group-reared animals and spent more time alone. Body weight was not correlated with rearing conditions or with behavioral measures. Increase or decrease in rank between 8 and 20 mo. was associated with faster or slower than average weight gain.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Playback experiments with Acrocephalus warblers [A. schoenobaenus and A. scirpaceus] in areas of sympatry and allopatry [in England UK] reveal that significant interspecific responses occured under certain conditions of competition in sympatry. These were when a later arriving species overlapped and invaded the habitat already occupied by the earlier arriving species. The latter were dominant in interspecific interactions. Earlier models which suggested that interspecific territorialism results largely through failure to discriminated between 2 spp. are discussed, and do not explain the present and similar cases. Learning may also play a role, and certain individuals may learn to recognize and respond to the songs of congenerics who are regularly heard and encountered in competitive situations.

AB Males of pupfish Cyprinodon sp. established breeding territories on substrates that provided topographic diversity. Territories in optimal breeding habitat were smaller, overlapped less with adjacent territories, and were defended by larger males than those in marginal habitats. In optimal habitats males defended boundaries efficiently by threat displays, and spent most of their time in the center of territories, whereas in marginal habitat males engaged more frequently in overt aggression and spent less time near the center of their territories. When objects suitable for defense were introduced, territories were established rapidly, and their configuration was determined by the topography of the object.

AB Interactions between the jack, C. ignobilis, a facultative schooling species, and the Hawaiian anchovy, S. purpureus, an obligate schooler were studied within an enclosure in the field in Hawaii [USA]. Single predators were the most successful at capturing isolated (individual) prey, and relatively unsuccessful at capturing individuals in schools. Grouped (schooled) predators were the most successful at capturing schooled prey. The leading or 1st predator was the most successful member of a group or school at capturing isolated or schooled prey. Following predators tended to make it possible to catch more prey earlier in the experiments. Larger predator groups were able to break up schools of prey quickly, resulting in increased numbers of prey becoming isolated. These prey were captured before they could reform or join other schools. As the initial size of the prey school increased, the percent individuals captured declined. Schooling in prey reduces the time a visually orienting predator has to align himself with an individual prey. Schooling in predators may have co-evolved as an adaptation, making it possible for predators to break up and isolate schooled prey. Larger prey schools may have co-evolved to satiate or swamp the feeding capacity of a finite number of schooled predators and decrease the probability that a specific given individual would be captured.

TI INTRASPECIFIC AND INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS OF APODEMUS-SYLVATICUS (L)
   AND APODEMUS-FLAVICOLLIS (MELCHOIR) UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The coexistence of A. sylvaticus and A. flavicollis may be possible if A. flavicollis, a species with a more restricted niche, is competitively superior in interspecific encounters. Intra- and interspecific behavior of male and female A. sylvaticus and A. flavicollis was examined in dyadic encounters in a small arena. Interactions between conspecifics indicate that intraspecifc behavior in A. sylvaticus and A. flavicollis is similar but, in interspecific interactions there were more submissive and agonistic acts, and less introductory and amicable behavior. A. flavicollis was dominant to A. sylvaticus in 63 out of 70 encounters and A. sylvaticus dominant in only one. This superiority may contribute to the persistence of small, localized populations of A. flavicollis despite the presence of A. sylvaticus.

   PARALASTOR SP (HYMENOPTERA EUMENIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The mechanisms of nest construction by an Australian eumenid mud wasp Paralastor sp. were studied. The nest is built in a number of distinct stages. Each stage is characterized by a different form of constructional behavior, and is triggered by a specific stimulus. Nest construction occurs as a stimulus response chain sequence of events in which the completion of 1 stage provides the stimulus for commencement of the next. This is not a one-way reaction, as wasps can be made to omit or repeat certain sections in the sequence.

TI COLOR AND LEVELS OF AGGRESSION IN MIDAS CICHLID
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous work established that gold morphs of the Midas cichlid (Cichlasoma citrinellum) dominate normal ones of about the same size. Left unresolved was whether the gold morphs dominate because they are inherently more aggressive or because the gold color inhibits aggression. The issue was clarified by comparing levels of aggression within groups of golds only, normals only and golds plus normals. At first the groups of golds were the least aggressive. But 2 days later the levels of aggression in the other groups fell to about that of the golds. It is concluded that the gold color inhibits attack, but that this effect is only discernible in groups when they are establishing inter-individual relationships disappearing when the groups stabilize. Gold coloration inhibits attacking by stimulating fear responses.

TI BEHAVIORAL COMPARISON OF AYLESBURY AND MALLARD DUCKS - SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sexual behavior of the Aylesbury duck is compared with that of its progenitor, the Mallard duck [Anas platyrhynchos]. There have been changes in intensity of the social displays of the Aylesbury duck which tend to reduce the attention-catching features of these displays, and the down-up display is performed less frequently than in the Mallard duck. Aylesbury ducks incite several drakes, Mallard ducks incite only 1 drake. Similar differences between the 2 varieties were seen in pre-copulatory pumping. Using several other criteria, as well as inciting and pre-pumping, it was found that Aylesbury ducks do not form pairs; Mallard ducks will. The significance of these changes for domestication is discussed.

TI ROLE OF PHEROMONES IN SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR OF GOLDFISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male goldfish (Carassius auratus) discriminate between ovulated and unovulated females on the basis of chemical cues. Goldfish males made temporarily anosmic by occlusion of the nares, or permanently anosmic by section of the olfactory nerves showed a marked decrease in sexual behavior. Preference testes in a Y-maze indicate that the pheromone is present in the ovarian fluid of an ovulated female. Shortly after ovulation the female goldfish releases a pheromone from the ovary which attracts the male and elicits the persistent courtship that accompanies spawning.

TI EFFECT OF HUNGER ON DRINKING BEHAVIOR OF RODENTS ADAPTED FOR MESIC AND
   XERIC ENVIRONMENTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations of drinking behavior were taken on 6 spp. [Rattus norvegicus, Dipodomys spectabilis, D. merriami, Meriones unguiculatus, Mus musculus, Peromyscus leucopus] during fasting. Four of these species were wild-caught and had not previously been examined for food deprivation polydipsia (FDP). These data support an hypothesis that a negative correlation exists between water avaiability in the natural habitat and the occurrence of FDP. Namely, xerophilous species exhibit an absolute polydipsia during food deprivation while mesically adapted species evidence depressed water consumption. Urine analyses during food deprivation indicated substantial decreases in electrolyte and osmotic pressure concentrations in all species. The drinking patterns of the 3 desert species investigated are discussed with reference to the availability of green vegetation in the natural habitat; however, there is presently no explanation for the observed polydipsia.

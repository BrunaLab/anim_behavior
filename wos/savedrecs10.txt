AB The mating and social approach responses of domestic guinea pigs which were reared in individual cages from birth to the age of 80 days, were compared with those of mother-reared animals. The isolates all made approach responses to a like-sexed congener, and upon subsequent exposures to receptive (potent) opposite sexed guinea pigs, their mating patterns, when displayed, corresponded to those of the controls. Interaction with conspeclfics was not essential for the development of social behavior in guinea pigs, while experiential and situational factors may affect the probability of males'' performing the mating pattern.

Subjects were observed at the beginning of the dark part of the diurnal cycle. A time sample method was used to obtain data. Behavior was recorded in terms of 25 categories: 13 non-social and 12 social. Isolated subjects engaged in more exploratory locomotion, oral consummatory behavior, attentive immobility, pawing behavior, and tail manipulation and engaged in less sleep and rest than grouped subjects. Some grouped subjects did not develop 2 non-social behaviors: pawing behavior and tail manipulation. For most behaviors, differences between subjects were consistent over time. The percentage of time that subjects engaged in each category of behavior varied during development.

TI EFFECT OF IMMUNE TOLERANT STATE ON EARLY BEHAVIOUR OF DOMESTIC FOWL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Depression of the immunological system of White Leghorn and F1 hybrid Barred Rock X Rhode Island Red chicks alters the level of approach-following and withdrawal escape behavior. The hypo-immunological state was induced by egg parabiosis during incubation or by repeated postnatal injections of chicken serum alpha-globulins (Fraction IV - Pentex). Confirmation of immunological depression and abrogation was ascertained by prolonged viable retention of leg skin grafts and depression of the animal''s circulating gamma globulin titers. All such experimentally altered animals demonstrated increased following of a stimulus object and increased withdrawal escape activity. Approximately 1/2 of the control animals showed almost no following or activity. This pilot study provides suggestive evidence that biochemically altered chicks in the test situations have undergone some form of fundamental behavioral change.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Comparison was made of the number and type of interactions between adult males, females and weaned juveniles, and the incidence of 20 common behavior patterns in these interactions. Interactions were nearly 4 times more frequent in the cage than the wild; approach-retreat interactions were more common in the cage, especially between females. Agonistic behavior was similar in the 2 environments, the differences being mainly in these behavior patterns shown to be little correlated with rank. Friendly behavior showed more differences, many consistent with a higher level of stress in the caged group. Wild males had no detectable hierarchy and frequently moved between troops. Their approach-retreat behavior among themselves was similar to that among females, their friendly behavior differed in ways suggesting a higher tension than betwen females. The males form a highly cooperative policing system. Results are discussed in terms of the relation between hierarchy formation and environmental stress.

TI CHANGES IN BEHAVIOUR OF LEBISTES RETICULATUS UPON A REPEATED SHADOW
   STIMULUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The fear responses shown by L. reticulatus to an artificial moving shadow are a fleeing response followed by a period of freezing. Changes in these responses in the course of a series of stimuli are described. Both responses decreased with stimulus -repetition, but freezing persisted longer, together with orientation movements, which replace fleeing. The response waning was stimulus-specific. More frequent presentation of the stimulus led to more rapid decrease in fleeing, but had no effect on the time course of changes in freezing. Changes in fleeing and freezing did not occur together, but both are considered manifestations of fear. The significance of the results for general theories of response waning is discussed. The different changes in the fear responses of Lebistes suggest an effect on the motivational control of fear responses. It is suggested that increased discrimination of fear-producing stimuli is necessary for the waning of fear responses.

TI COMPARISONS OF SUCCESSIVE DISCRIMINATION REVERSAL PERFORMANCES AMONG
   CLOSELY AND REMOTELY RELATED AVIAN SPECIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The successive reversal performances of 4 different avian species, Bob White quail, white Leghorn chickens, yellow head parrots, and red-billed blue magpies, were studied across 29 reversals of a spatial discrimination, in a form board box. One session of 20 trials was given each training day until a criterion of 2 or less errors per session was attained. All 4 groups showed appreciable decline in errors and sessions per problems as well as initial errors. All 4 groups differed significantly in total numbers of errors and sessions decreased progressively from the chickens, to the quail, to the parrots, with the lowest scores contributed by the magpie. The difference between parrot and magpie scores was less than that between the chicken and the quail. However, it appears that the successive reversal method can provide a system of behavioral calibration that is meaningfully correlated with taxonomic position.

TI EFFECTS OF ALARM SUBSTANCE ON SCHOOLING BEHAVIOUR OF RASBORA
   HETEROMORPHA DUNCKER IN DAY AND NIGHT CONDITIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of the specific alarm substance on the cohesion of 4 schools of R. heteromorpha was studied on the basis of photographic records of the schools made in light and darkness at different moments of the 24-hr. cycle. The alarm substance has a more marked effect during daytime, even when the fish are tested in darkness. In the absence of alarm substance, illumination at night does not increase the school-cohesion in such a manner as to make it differ significantly from the normal night dispersion. These observations suggest diurnal fluctuation in the readiness of fishes to school in response to external stimuli. The role played by visual information in enhancing grouping is discussed accordingly.

TI EFFECT OF INTENSITY OF AUDITORY STIMULATION ON DIRECTIONAL EYE MOVEMENTS
   IN HUMAN NEONATE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To test one aspect of the general hypothesis that the human neonate turns towards weak stimuli and away from strong stimuli, the relationship between direction of lateral conjugate eye movements and intensity of auditory stimulation was examined in 53 2-day old girls. One group received a lower intensity auditory stimulus and another a higher intensity stimulus. Since the effective intensity of a stimulus is, in part, a function of the state of the organism, half of the Ss [subjects] in each group were tested in a prefeeding state (higher arousal level) and half in a post-feeding state (lower arousal level). Under conditions of either less intense stimulation or of lower arousal level, ipsi-directional responding was obtained to stimuli presented at the right ear. The more intense stimulus or the higher arousal condition resulted in the disappearance of the ipsi-directional response pattern to right stimulation. At the left ear, the effectively more intense stimulus, produced ipsi-directional responding whereas the effectively less intense stimulus had no effect. These findings support the contention that directional responding is a function of effective stimulus intensity and offer partial support for the hypothesis tested. They also suggest a lateral difference in auditory threshold.

A small number of chin glands from hares, Lepus europaeus P. was studied for comparative purposes. The chin glands are larger in males than females. Sexual dimorphism appears when sexual maturity occurs. Males chin more frequently than females. The size of the gland and the frequency of chinning are correlated with social status. The glands seemed to be largest and most active during the breeding season. Castration during early life inhibited both the development of the glands and chinning in male rabbits, but in castrated females the size of the gland increased as compared with non-castrated animates. Histological changes associated with the secretion were studied in rabbits of different ages, and social status, of known frequency of chinning, in castrated animals, and during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Vacuolated secretory cells were associated with heavy secretion. They were not seen in immature animals or those which did not chin frequently and formed the entire glandular tissue in some heavily secreting animals. The vacuolated cells seemed to be secretory cells in a state of intense secretion. Dark cells were more common in males. Chin glands in hares were much smaller than in rabbits. The vacuolated type of cells was not seen in hares.

TI BEHAVIOUR OF AN AVIAN PREDATOR IN AN EXPERIMENT SIMULATING BATESIAN
   MIMICRY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Investigations of the behavior of an avian predator, Parus atri- capillus, in an experiment simulating Batesian mimicry are reported. Seeds painted either orange or green were used as prey (simulating models, their mimics, and non-mimetics), with the models dipped into quinine hydrochloride to make them noxious. The birds learned to discriminate, by external color only, noxious models, with their corresponding mimics (one color) from the tasteful non-mimetics (the other color). This discrimination took the form of: acceptance of non-mimetics and rejection of models and their mimics, refusal to eat many of the tasteful mimics accepted (in apparent contradiction of the birds'' gustatory senses), a greater time lapse before accepting a mimic than before accepting a non-mimetic seed, and a variety of abnormal activities before accepting a mimic. The last 3 points are new, and evolutionary significant findings in predator behavior relevant to the phenomenon of Batesian mimicry.

AB In animal species with parental care, caregivers' investment is often driven by offspring solicitation signals. Previous studies, particularly in birds and mammals, show that parents modulate their response to these signals according to characteristics such as their intensity and number per unit of time. In crocodilians, mature embryos still in the egg emit hatching calls perceived by other embryos and by the adult guarding the nest. These calls help to synchronize hatching within the nest and encourage the adult to dig the nest and help the young to hatch. However, the embryos do not start calling all at once, and it can take several hours or even days after embryos have started to vocalize before the adult digs the nest. When and why does the crocodile parent decide to respond to the hatching calls of its offspring? Here we show that Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus, mothers only start digging their nests if the hatching calls are emitted in a sustained manner by the offspring. While females react with head and body orientation movements to isolated calls, only continuous bursts of calls lasting several tens of seconds induce digging behaviour. This high response threshold on the part of the mothers probably limits the untimely digging up of eggs that may not have reached full maturity, thus avoiding damaging them, and is likely to favour the synchronization of offspring hatching. Overall, this study suggests that the parental response of Nile crocodiles to offspring solicitations is not necessarily linearly correlated with the number of begging signals received but may require a sufficient number of begging signals to exceed a threshold.

AB In mammals, the maternal bond is essential for the development of newborns. Compared with most terrestrial mammals, cetacean newborns are extremely precocious in motor and sensory development, but remain dependent on their mothers for nutrition. Little is known about the mother-calf relationship in harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, where the high fecundity of females, short duration of lactation and precocious development of calves may challenge the amount of maternal care and the nature and intensity of interactions. We used photo-identification and drones to monitor a wild female harbour porpoise that had nine calves over 9 years and quantified her interactions with her calves aged between 1 and 5 months as a cross-sectional study. We compared their behaviour with other mother-calf pairs at 9 months postpartum. Between 1 and 9 months postpartum, the calves showed the most effort in maintaining proximity, in that the mothers were frequently observed to leave and the calves to return after separation. Across all months, the calves spent about half their time within a 2 m range from their mothers, synchronizing their respirations. While in close proximity, the calves mostly stayed in echelon position in their first month and in infant position at 2-9 months postpartum. The mothers increased distances from their calves when travelling or foraging, and the calves increasingly departed from their mothers with age for foraging, resting or exploring. The mother-calf relationship in harbour porpoises appears to be short-term and primarily maintained by calves from the first month of life. We suggest that maternal care in harbour porpoises is less pronounced than in many odontocetes because of the high fecundity of females, short interbirth interval and high energetic costs associated with gestation and lactation.

AB Owing to the large, three-dimensional, fluid nature of their aquatic environment, the impact of habitat configuration has rarely been investigated in cetacean societies. However, in some coastal areas such as large estuarine systems and lagoons, where environmental variables can be spatially structured, the role of habitat configuration in shaping dolphin societies should not be ignored. In the present study, we examined the social structure of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, in waters off the Leizhou Peninsula (LZP), northern South China Sea, using an 11-year photo identification data set (2013-2023). We identified four mixed sex/age communities with segregated region preferences. Three communities exhibited a preference to waters of intermediate depth (5 m <= depth < 10 m), while one community preferred shallow waters (< 5 m in depth). Dolphins inhabiting Zhanjiang Bay and northern Leizhou Bay preferred deeper waters, probably a result of reduced access to the shallow waters in these areas. The double dekker semipartialling multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure (MRQAP-DSP) suggested that spatial overlap and gregariousness were the most significant predictors describing the LZP humpback dolphins' social structure. Community size and their geographic/social positions outperformed predation risk (as reflected by shark-inflicted scars) in shaping communities' sociality (measured as Strength, Eigenvector centrality, Reach, Clustering coefficient and Affinity). From our results, we suggest that dolphins with similar area preferences developed strong associations that were stable over time and a habitat-structured social network. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex social structure of coastal dolphins and provides new insights into dolphin behaviours that can be important for developing effective management strategies.

AB Optimal escape theory predicts that prey balance the costs and benefits of fleeing. However, the use of prior experience in prey escape decisions has been overlooked. Indeed, when repeatedly exposed to a nonlethal yet threatening stimulus, prey may adjust their escape response by habituating, delaying escape when repeatedly exposed to that stimulus, or by becoming sensitized, escaping sooner. Here, we investigated intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of short-term variation in flight initiation distance (FID, distance at initiating escape) in response to repeated human approaches in incubating female common eiders, Somateria mollissima. We predicted habituation to repeated exposure to threatening but nonlethal stimuli, reflected in decreased FID. We also expected increased habituation in females with a high current reproductive value (older breeders, females in good condition or laying large clutches) or brood value (early breeders). Last, we investigated whether changes in FID varied with threat level (i.e. different adult or nest predation risk or breeding habitat). The magnitude of change in FID was small and varied among individuals, depending on individual traits (body condition, clutch size and phenology) and perceived threat (island-specific adult predation risk). Accordingly, females in poorer body condition, that laid larger clutches or laid earlier in the season were more prone to become sensitized over repeated approaches. Consistent with the risk allocation hypothesis predicting a dampening of antipredator responses under chronic risk exposure, females were less prone to become sensitized when nesting on islands with high adult predation risk. These results underline the ability of animals to make plastic state- and context-dependent adjustments of antipredator behaviour when repeatedly confronted with nonlethal stimuli. Nevertheless, given the limited magnitude of within-individual, short-term adjustment of FID compared to the among-individual variation in FID, questions remain concerning the efficacy of these antipredator responses in a context of rapidly changing predation regimes.

AB The birth of a first offspring represents a major change in a female mammal's social circumstances. We hypothesize that the transition to motherhood marks a significant shift in the social network dynamics of female vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, and represents the crucial boundary between juvenile and adult patterns of engagement. To test this, we compare the grooming network structure of primiparous and multiparous females, using both direct and indirect measures of centrality. We found that, following the birth of their first infant, ego-structure of primiparous females converged with that of multiparous females and that primiparous females became more central in their grooming networks around their first birth event, as measured by eigenvector centrality. Examining shifts in the number of new social ties formed across the birth event, we found a very small increase in the formation of new strong ties, but a larger increase in the number of additional weak ties. A simulated 'knockout' analysis showed that both types of ties contributed to the observed increase in eigenvector centrality. Overall, our findings support the idea that motherhood serves as a catalyst for juveniles to transition into adult social configurations. Note, however, that although the juvenileeadult boundary marked the temporal locus of change for social integration, there was, nevertheless, a striking consistency in the stability of egonetwork structure across both the juvenile period and through the motherhood transition. This structure may enhance individual flexibility in social engagement and accommodate the specific needs of females as they experience changes in status and broader demographic shifts within their groups.

AB Animals benefit from cannibalism via reduced competition for food sources or acquiring nutrition. When cannibalism occurs between kin, it is costly to individuals because of reduced inclusive fitness. Hence, animals should avoid cannibalism between kin. Because the chance that a cannibal would consume relatives can be affected by behaviours of predators and prey, it is crucial to study avoidance of cannibalism from the viewpoints of both predators and prey simultaneously. Here, we investigated avoidance of cannibalism by adult females and larvae of the predatory mite Gynaeseius liturivorus, focusing on their kinship. Adult female G. liturivorus protect their eggs against predators by remaining on oviposition sites, and do not feed on conspecific eggs, but do feed on larvae and juveniles. When adult females were kept with larvae, they fed more on nonoffspring larvae than on their own offspring. Newly hatched larvae dispersed from oviposition sites in the presence of nonmothers faster than in the presence of their mothers. These results suggest that adult females and larvae of G. liturivorus avoided cannibalism via kin recognition. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sickness behaviours are hallmarks of many infections and can influence transmission by altering behaviours of infected animals. Because sickness behaviour expression can depend on a host's environmental context, such as ambient temperature, it is critical to examine whether temperature alters sickness behaviour expression and the resulting potential for pathogen transmission. House finches, Haemorhous mexicanus, are known to increase bird feeder use in colder (subthermoneutral) temperatures to meet thermoregulatory demands, but less is known about the behaviour of sick house finches under subthermoneutral conditions. Understanding whether cold temperatures alter sickness behaviours and conspecific contacts is key for predicting how abiotic factors such as temperature impact transmission potential between sick and healthy birds in ways relevant to the spread of pathogens such as Mycoplasma gallisepticum in house finches. We used a 2 x 2 design to examine effects of cold temperature and pseudo-infection on house finch sickness behaviours by manipulating both ambient temperature (thermoneutral or subthermoneutral) and infection status (control or pseudo-infected via lipopolysaccharide injection) of one bird per pair ('index bird'). We quantified several sickness behaviours and found that temperature and pseudo-infection had an interactive effect on the degree of index bird immobility, and temperature alone influenced the time index birds spent at the food dish. Neither temperature nor pseudo-infection status influenced index bird activity. To determine how temperature and pseudo-infection affect the potential for pathogen transmission to untreated cagemates, we applied a fluorescent and transferrable powder around the conjunctiva of the index bird in each pair and quantified the amount of powder transferred to its cagemate. We found that powder transfer, our proxy for pathogen transmission potential, was significantly higher in pairs housed at warmer temperatures, regardless of the index bird's pseudo-infection status. Ambient temperatures appear to have complex effects on sickness behaviours in house finches, with key potential implications for pathogen spread.

AB One way mammalian mothers support offspring is by intervening on their behalf when they receive conspecific aggression. Maternal intervention protects offspring and facilitates mother-offspring rank correlation in several female-philopatric species. We tested the hypothesis that maternal intervention during development similarly facilitates mother-offspring rank correlation in one of our two male-philopatric closest living relatives: bonobos, Pan paniscus, for whom male ranks have been described as matrifocal but mechanisms of status transmission are unclear. We predicted mothers would intervene at higher rates in bonobos compared to chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, where sons earn adult ranks independently. We expected this difference would be especially pronounced for sons as they reached reproductive age (similar to 8 years) and when aggressors were adult males, which female bonobos, but not female chimpanzees, often dominate. However, for both sons and daughters of all ages (0.5-16 years) and against aggressors of varying age and sex, bonobo mothers in Kokolopori, DRC (N = 22 pairs, 210 conflicts) intervened less frequently than did chimpanzee mothers at Ngogo, Uganda (N = 66 pairs, 221 conflicts), doing so in 8% versus 49% of all conflicts. These differences persisted regardless of the severity of aggression offspring received and the distress they demonstrated. Our results provide no support for our hypothesis that conflict intervention facilitates mother-son rank correlation in bonobos. Nor are patterns explained by additional alternative hypotheses related to species variation in costs of retaliation, quality of female-female relationships or infanticide risk. We introduce two new hypotheses: (1) that success in aggressive competition is less important for male bonobos than for male chimpanzees and (2) proclivities for support are heightened in chimpanzees compared to bonobos because of increased ingroup protectiveness in chimpanzees. The latter hypothesis arises from our unexpected, preliminary observation that nonmother bonobo bystanders intervened less often than nonmother chimpanzee bystanders during these events.

AB The acoustic structure of nonhuman primate vocalizations can vary substantially within a call type and may converge between social partners. Examining which social partners share call structure can inform our understanding of the function of vocal learning and communication in nonhuman animals. We assessed vocal convergence of female gelada contact grunts within multiple levels of gelada society: small female-philopatric reproductive units that maintain close proximity and larger bands of units that preferentially associate while foraging. We also measured the extent to which grunt acoustic structure varied by caller identity and behavioural state at the time of the call, as well as genetic relatedness, when assessing acoustic similarity between females' grunts. The acoustic structure of female gelada grunts differed between individuals as well as between foraging, travelling and socializing behavioural states. Female gelada grunts were more similar between pairs living in the same band than between pairs living in different bands. This effect was not found for pairs living in the same unit compared to pairs living in different units within the same band. As genetic relatedness did not predict similarity in grunt acoustic structure, we propose that vocal convergence within bands is the result of vocal learning. Vocal convergence at the higher level of gelada society suggests this vocal learning is selective and not simply the result of auditory exposure to conspecific calls. Vocal convergence in geladas may function to maintain spatial cohesion, which is a more critical challenge for bands than for units. (c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Socially induced plasticity in mating signals and mate preferences is widespread in animals. The timing of plasticity induction is key for mating and evolutionary consequences: plasticity induced before and after dispersal often results in different patterns of mate choices. Here we discuss two additional factors that may be of importance: the nature of social interactions that are involved at different stages, and the direction and strength of the effects. We review a case study with the Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers. In spite of a wide scope for social plasticity in E. binotata across life stages, effects of the juvenile social environment were stronger and more common, especially those influencing the signal-preference relationship. These results emphasize the importance of studying variation in plasticity induced along various life stages and of considering all the mating traits that may be socially plastic. We suggest that systematic investigation of these patterns across taxa will help better understand the origin of diversity in animal communication systems.

AB Many insects can decide when and where to lay their eggs. In some species, mature females delay oviposition to optimize their reproductive effort in response to unfavourable environmental conditions, lack of oviposition substrates or lack of mates. This behaviour might be an adaptive decision to gain a higher return on reproductive investment or may occur nonadaptively and result in lower fitness for mothers and their offspring. However, empirical studies investigating consequences of delayed ovipo-sition focus mostly on haplodiploid Hymenoptera, thereby limiting the generalization of findings to other haplodiploid arthropods. Here, we studied this in thrips (Thysanoptera), an insect order that has inde-pendently evolved haplodiploidy. We deprived gravid Pezothrips kellyanus females of oviposition sub-strates for up to 2 days and examined the consequences for early reproductive effort and offspring fitness. Irrespective of a female's mating status, delayed oviposition did not affect egg size, but it increased egg load and number of the first oviposition bout, suggesting that egg development was not interrupted by the oviposition delay and eggs were not reabsorbed. Offspring sex ratio in mated females remained unaffected. Finally, oviposition delay did not affect offspring fitness in terms of survival, development time, adult size and longevity under dehydration stress. This suggests that gravid P. kellyanus females are able to avoid physiological oviposition delay costs in their early reproductive effort. This may be important for the evolution of oviposition behaviour because the capacity to delay oviposition without physiological costs may allow females to search for mates and better oviposition sites.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many territorial animals exhibit differences in their responses against intruders based on the level of threat that they pose. The dear enemy effect refers to situations in which territorial aggression is stronger against strangers, and the nasty neighbour effect refers to situations in which territorial aggression is stronger against neighbours. Using playback experiments during prebreeding and postbreeding seasons in a songbird from Neotropical montane forests (grey-browed brushfinch, Arremon assimilis), we found that males exhibited the nasty neighbour effect because they responded more aggressively towards neighbours than towards strangers. However, territorial behaviour varied seasonally: (1) aggression towards all intrusions by neighbours were equally strong regardless of the location from which they were perceived prior to reproduction and (2) individuals were more aggressive towards neighbour males when perceived at a different border of their territory to the one they shared during the postbreeding season. We conclude that territorial males respond to neighbours by assessing their threat to paternity and territoriality, and thus modulate their aggressive response based on the season. In contrast, limited responses to strangers suggest that these individuals do not represent a serious threat to males of A. assimilis during the seasons we studied them. Territorial aggression against neighbours appears to be a mate-guarding mechanism in this species. Our results differ from those found in temperate zones, where strangers often elicit stronger responses, indicating they may represent a greater threat than neighbours. Additional studies on the behavioural ecology of tropical birds are required to understand the generality of nasty neighbour effects and the drivers of territorial behaviours.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behaviour has the potential to retard evolutionary adaptation by equipping animals with the capacity to radically change their interactions with the environment without evolving. Despite this potential for plasticity, laboratory studies frequently identify among-population differences in responses to identical stimuli, suggesting that genetic adaption often reduces behavioural flexibility. However, laboratory environments are typically far removed from nature, so their relevance to the variation we might expect to see in the wild (either among environments or as a result of changes in climate) is unclear. This is a particularly acute issue in relation to behaviour because behaving in an optimal fashion requires animals to receive and process complex sensory information which may be disrupted by laboratory conditions. We translocated newly adult male field crickets, Gryllus campestris, from five high-altitude and five lowaltitude populations into a single low-altitude meadow from which we had removed all naturally present males. By tagging every individual and employing a network of 140 video cameras we were able to record comprehensive behavioural information from early adulthood until death. This allowed us to directly compare the behaviour of individuals from populations known to be genetically divergent and adapted to either high or low altitudes. We found very limited evidence for an effect on behaviour of the altitudinal environment in which crickets had evolved and developed, despite the large scale of our study (>20 000 h of observations of 128 males). Our findings suggests that when provided with all the environmental cues present in their natural environment, local adaptation does not lead to substantial constraints on behaviour. This supports the hypothesis that the potential flexibility of behaviour may tend to reduce selection for local adaptation. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Bearded capuchin monkeys at Fazenda Boa Vista, Piaui, Brazil older than 8 years routinely crack palm nuts with a stone hammer and anvil. An embodied, perception-action stance hypothesizes that mon-keys' improving skill at this task is enabled by learning affordances of spatial and force relations pro-duced with objects. Affordances are individual-relative opportunities for action that may change across development. We evaluated predictions linking behaviours with nuts and stones and body mass to success at nut cracking in young bearded capuchins (1.3-6.3 years old) and adults over three annual observation periods. Behaviours with nuts and stones reflected the monkeys' learning affordances for cracking; body mass constrained affordances for cracking. For each period in which they were observed, individuals were assigned to novice, intermediate or expert classes in accord with their success at cracking nuts. Novices did not crack nuts, despite striking them with stones. Body mass was modestly associated with intermediates', but not experts', likelihood of cracking a nut. Experts exhibited higher proportions of manipulation devoted to positioning nuts on the anvil and shorter bouts of cracking than intermediates; intermediates exhibited greater variability in these variables than experts or novices. The strongest classification model predicting individuals' assignments to skill class with 89% accuracy combined average bout duration and the ratio of manipulation devoted to positioning to other manip-ulation. The findings suggest practise using the body-pus-tool system for cracking palm nuts supports affordance learning and results in gradual mastery of this skill and that changing body mass plays a small role in this process.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The decision rule of direct reciprocity states that an individual helps someone who previously helped them. An alternative explanation to observations of reciprocal exchanges of help is copying by imitation. Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, are known to exchange food and allogrooming reciprocally among social partners. We asked whether this behaviour is based on copying by imitation or the application of the direct reciprocity decision rule. Norway rats used a sequential food-pulling paradigm. To assess whether focal rats help according to the direct reciprocity decision rule, we predicted that focal rats should be less helpful to partners from an experimental defection or self-pulling treatment than to partners that previously helped them in a cooperation treatment. To assess whether focal rats help partners by copying via imitation, we predicted that focal rats should be more helpful to partners that previously pulled more often than to partners that had pulled less often. The experimental design involved experience phases consisting of three treatments and three sessions per treatment for each experimental subject, in which a partner operated a stick-pulling apparatus providing food to the focal rat or only for themselves. This was followed by a test phase in which the focal rat could help the partners. Focal rats gave less help to partners from the defection or self-pulling treatments than to previously cooperative partners, and latency to the first help by focal rats was longer for partners from the self-pulling treatments than for cooperative partners, which are results consistent with the direct reciprocity decision rule. Focal rats did not give more help to partners that pulled more often, which is not consistent with copying by imitation. Hence our results are consistent with the direct reciprocity decision rule but not with copying by imitation. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB In many species, prenatal maternal stress leads to long-lasting changes in physiological and behavioural individual characteristics. However, these prenatal effects can be modulated by the postnatal environ-ment and especially by maternal care. The impact of maternal care on the modulation of prenatal maternal stress effects has been investigated mainly in mammalian models but, surprisingly, remains little explored in avian species. In this study, we determined the extent to which the subsequent effects of prenatal maternal stress on offspring growth and emotional responses are modulated by the presence of an adoptive mother during postnatal development using a precocial bird, the Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica , as our study species. All experimental quail chicks were the offspring of females that experienced an environmental stressor induced by a socially unstable environment during laying and egg production. Previous reports showed that social instability of laying quail increased their offspring's emotional reactivity and that this was related to an increase in yolk testosterone levels in their eggs. In this study, offspring hatched from socially unstable females were raised either with or without adoptive mothers. We found that mothered chicks were lighter during their first 3 weeks of age and that their emotional reactivity was lower (i.e. as shown by increased exploratory behaviours in a novel environ-ment, decreased neophobic responses in the home cage and decreased responses to social separation) relative to nonmothered chicks. Thus, our results highlight that maternal care could counteract the phenotypic consequences of prenatally stress-exposed birds. Our results clearly highlight that even in precocial species the presence of the mother has a fundamental importance in modulating the effects of prenatal conditions on the ontogeny of offspring behaviour and that this might be a key mechanism driving phenotypic plasticity in wild populations.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Reducing the bias due to unknown relationships in measuring the
   steepness of a dominance hierarchy

   interaction; egalitarian society; steepness of hierarchy
ID ORDER; MODEL
AB Measuring the steepness of a dominance hierarchy is important for classifying a social system in a con-tinuum between egalitarian and despotic. For this, often the steepness-slope from de Vries et al. (Animal Behaviour, 2006, 71, 585-592) is often used. It compares the cardinal and ordinal dominance rank of each individual using the slope of the linear regression. The disadvantage of this measure is that the slope be-comes lower the higher the proportion of unknown relationships (dyads without interactions). In the present paper, we investigate what causes this bias, and propose a solution. (1) We show that the bias is due to the treatment of unknown relationships by the dominance index currently used in this methodology, the David's score (namely by assuming, among other things, an equal number of wins and losses for both members of the pair). (2) Instead, using the Average Dominance Index (the average proportion of wins by each individual from all its opponents) reduces the bias due to unknown relationships, because it excludes these relationships, and (3) the standard error of the steepness-slope based on the Average Dominance Index is smaller. (4) The two indices (David's score and Average Dominance Index) result in similar steepness-slopes when all relationships are known. To compare the two indices we use empirical data (from four group-years of wild vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and data from a computational model on dominance interactions in a group (DomWorld). We conclude that the Average Dominance Index (compared to the David's score) is preferable for measuring the steepness-slope.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social learning can enable the rapid dissemination of behaviours throughout a population. Rejection of foreign eggs is a key defence used by hosts of avian brood parasites, and although learning has long been recognized as an important factor in egg rejection decisions, the role played by social cues remain less well understood. Here, we aimed to determine whether access to social information influenced egg rejection behaviours in semicolonial barn swallows, Hirundo rustica. By manipulating the social infor-mation available from a neighbouring nest, we showed that swallows with access to social information (i.e. a neighbour that recently rejected an egg) were more likely to reject a foreign egg that those that did not have access to social information (i.e. a neighbour that did not reject an egg). A subset of nests were videorecorded, and in these recordings the rejections were always performed by the incubating parent rather than a conspecific. This study provides direct evidence that egg rejection behaviours can be informed by social information in the absence of brood parasites, and in doing so highlights the dynamic nature of the defences that hosts deploy against brood parasitism.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The question of how animals make decisions has been intensely studied by ethologists, behavioural ecologists, psychologists and neuroscientists alike. Foraging bumble bees are an excellent system to study decision making because, as eusocial insects, foragers are solely focused on the task of collecting food for the colony. Bumble bees are generalist foragers of ephemeral resources that do not store food long term and are thus expected to show flexible adjustments in foraging motivation in response to stored food. However, their feeding behaviour at resources as a function of stored food has not been explored. Here, we present results demonstrating that bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) show flexible adjustments in foraging motivation in response to colony food stores across different timescales. First, bumble bees showed decreased foraging motivation as the colony accumulated food over the course of a day. Second, bees that developed in colonies with full food stores showed persistently lower motivation than bees developing in colonies with impoverished food stores even days after those food stores were removed. We further demonstrate that this persistent low motivation may be explained by the lower amount of abdominal lipids in nutrient-depleted colonies. Our results provide evidence for a mechanism that may mediate the social control of individual foraging motivation, an important step in the evolution of eusociality.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Interactions among individuals of the same species inform us about resource value and sociality; however, for species that are difficult to observe directly, these behaviours are potentially missed or misinterpreted via remote monitoring approaches. Here, we investigated how agonistic interactions influenced temporal and spatial variation in the social structuring of loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, foraging on sponges at a reef (Zakynthos, Greece) over multiple years. We directly observed individuals via snorkel surveys (with photoidentification and videos) supported by aerial drone surveys. Most turtles were immature loggerheads, of which half were detected in more than 1 year. Individual loggerheads occupied distinct (very small) patches on the reef, with low overlap when foraging. In-teractions generally occurred when loggerheads were adjacent to, or passing through, patches occupied by other individuals. Interactions between loggerheads represented an extremely small fraction of the activity budget, but potentially consumed two to three times more energy than swimming and foraging. Escalation of aggression, unexpectedly, skipped the passive (evaluation) phase in half of interactions (starting with biting and chasing), with contests being primarily won by more aggressive individuals, independent of body size and duration of presence (i.e. reef occupancy in years). Distinct hierarchical structuring was detected based on win outcomes and spatial area use within each year; however, the number and combination of turtles frequenting the reef varied across years, with individuals only dominating for 2-3 years before departing (or returning intermittently) and being replaced. The un-expected fight dynamics and regularly changing hierarchies indicate that individuals perceived the resource value of sponges differently, which was attributed to differences in their ability to assess resource abundance and/or availability of resources at alternative sites. Our results contribute to the emerging field of sociality in reptiles.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID COLOR
AB It has recently been found that iridescence, a taxonomically widespread form of animal coloration defined by a change in hue with viewing angle, can act as a highly effective form of camouflage. However, little is known about whether iridescence can confer a survival benefit to prey postdetection and, if so, which optical properties of iridescent prey are important for this putative protective function. Here, we tested the effects of both iridescence and surface gloss (i.e. specular reflection) on the attack behaviour of prey-naive avian predators. Using real and artificial jewel beetle, Sternocera aequisignata, wing cases, we found that iridescence provides initial protection against avian predation by significantly reducing the willingness to attack. Importantly, we found that the main factor explaining this aversion is iridescence, not multiple colours per se, with surface gloss also having an independent effect. Our results are important because they demonstrate that even when prey are presented up close and against a mismatching background, iridescence may confer a survival benefit by inducing hesitation or even, as sometimes observed, an aversion response in attacking birds. Furthermore, this means that even post detection, prey do not necessarily need to have secondary defences such as sharp spines or toxins for iridescence to have a protective effect. Taken together, our results suggest that reduced avian predation could facilitate the initial evolution of iridescence in many species of insects and that it is the defining feature of iridescence, its colour changeability, that is important for this effect.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Behavioural variation in courtship has become a central theme in the study of sexual selection. Courtship behaviour can vary consistently between males (between-individual variation) due to inherent charac-teristics of individuals, but males may also plastically adjust their courtship (within-individual variation) in response to the characteristics of the potential breeding mate or the environmental contexts. However, the relative importance of these components in courtship behaviour remains poorly understood. Here, we exposed male collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, to different stimulus females simulating a fe-male's visit to the male's territory during mate choice. We measured the male's latency to explicitly invite the female to visit the nestbox (hereafter, invitation latency), as a proxy of the male's motivation to mate. Repeated measurements of focal males (exposed to different stimulus females) and stimulus fe -males (presented to different males) allowed us to assess the relative importance of male and female identity in male courtship, while also assessing the importance of their phenotype and other environ-mental sources of within-individual variation in invitation latency. We found that invitation latency was determined by male and, to a lesser extent, female identity, with the latter suggesting the existence of male mate choice in the species. We failed to identify specific traits of males and females that influenced courtship behaviour, although male responsiveness to stimulus females increased as the season advanced, possibly due to the costs of delaying breeding in temperate breeding areas. Overall, these results suggest that invitation latency is a consistent courtship attribute in males that can be adjusted plastically according to perceived female quality and environmental conditions. We emphasize that understanding within-and between-individual sources of courtship variation is essential for assessing its evolutionary potential, as plasticity in the expression of sexual signals may affect their reliability and the strength of sexual selection on them.

AB Living in a social group may impose cognitive demands, for example individual recognition, social memory and the inhibition of behaviour when it is not adaptive. As the neural substrates for these cognitive skills are metabolically expensive, cognitive abilities may be positively related to the complexity of the social system. Where there is large spatiotemporal variation in the ecological conditions experienced and hence in the social system exhibited by species, selection may favour adaptive phenotypic plasticity of cognitive abilities involved in social tasks rather than evolved differences across populations. Here, we tested this hypothesis in a social-living teleost fish, the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We exposed new-born guppies to treatments that altered two parameters of social environmental complexity: group size (experiment 1) and group stability (experiment 2). Then, we assessed guppies' inhibitory control, the ability to withhold responding to a stimulus, a cognitive function that is critically involved in social interactions. In experiment 1, guppies reared alone showed higher levels of behavioural inhibition in a foraging task compared to guppies reared in pairs or in groups of six. In addition, we found that individuals' variance in performance was smaller for fish raised alone. In experiment 2, guppies reared in a stable social group showed greater inhibition than those from groups subjected to frequent fission-fusion events. These results reveal phenotypic plasticity of inhibitory control in guppies; however, contrary to prediction, they indicate greater inhibitory abilities developing in individuals exposed to 'simpler' social environments.

AB One prominent feature of collective attention is the so-called 'group size effect'. Often documented in studies of vigilance by animals foraging gregariously, this effect describes how individual group members are able to reduce their attention to environmental cues (e.g. predators) as group size increases, since the group can pool information from multiple individuals. Despite extensive literature in one context (foraging-vigilance), it remains unclear whether this effect can be observed in other contexts where animals face different informational demands (e.g. navigation). Using a custom-made sensor combining head-mounted inertial measurement unit and back-mounted GPS, we examined head movement, a proxy for visual scanning behaviour, in homing pigeons, Columba livia, flying alone, in pairs and in flocks (ca. 10 individuals). Individual birds' head movements decreased sharply when they switched from solo to paired flights and again when they switched from paired to flock flights. Homing efficiency (or route straightness) did not decrease in parallel with decreasing head movement but continued to increase over repeated flights. We also found systematic individual differences during flock homing flights, where birds positioned more frontally and more centrally in the flock made larger head movements. Moreover, leaders were positioned more frontally and tended to show larger head movements than followers. Decreased head movement by peripheral birds suggested increased attention to the rest of the flock rather than increased individual vigilance (contra 'the edge effect'). Overall, our results suggest that individual birds reduced their visual scanning during navigation because of the need to attend closely to fellow flock members to maintain flock cohesion. While reduced per capita visual scanning may reduce the amount of environmental information available to individual birds, it is likely to be compensated by the flock's collective attention.

AB Although rare among group-living primates, infanticide by females has been reported in several chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, populations. We examined 13 infanticidal attacks over 47 years at Gombe National Park, Tanzania to evaluate three adaptive hypotheses. (1) Exploitation of the infant as a food resource -by eating a vulnerable neonate, attackers gain calories that may be important during periods of food scarcity or energetic stress. (2) Resource competition -Gombe females concentrate their foraging in overlapping core areas and dominance rank influences foraging success. By killing the infant of a female with high core area overlap, the perpetrator removes a current and future competitor, improving her access to food. (3) Low cost -female chimpanzees mature and reproduce slowly, and longevity increases reproductive success. Physical aggression causes risk of severe injury or death, so females will only mount attacks when risks to the perpetrator are low. In support of hypothesis 1, females usually consumed the carcass. However, attacks were not more likely in times of resource or energy scarcity. In support of hypothesis 2, females attacked others with whom they shared core areas, but attacks did not cause shifts in ranging patterns. In support of hypothesis 3, one or more attackers always outranked the victim, the attacks often involved coalitions and victims usually lacked kin support. Attacks were more likely to be successful when attackers were not hindered by clinging infants and victims could not retreat. Our results provide further evidence for female competition and the adaptive value of female-led infanticide in this species. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Vocalizing animals often occur in complex acoustic environments where there is a high chance of acoustic interference from co-occurring species with spectrally overlapping vocalizations. Acoustic interference impedes detection and discrimination of signals, and may ultimately reduce fitness. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between spectral overlap and temporal overlap in a tropical savannah frog community. We predicted that species pairs that overlap spectrally would behaviourally respond to one another by avoiding calling at the same time, to minimize acoustic interference. We determined the calling activity of 14 frog species at four locations across 4 months during peak breeding season. We then determined the difference between observed and expected temporal overlap for all species pairs as a function of spectral overlap at three temporal scales (night-minute-call). There was potential for acoustic interference between many of the species studied with the calls of up to half of the species pairs at each site overlapping spectrally. There was no relationship between spectral overlap and observed-expected temporal overlap at either the night or minute level. Instead, calling activity was aggregated at both the night and minute level. Evidence of a negative relationship between spectral overlap and temporal overlap was found at the call level, with species pairs with greater mean spectral overlap calling together less frequently than expected. The observed aggregated calling at the night and minute level suggest that at gross timescales, factors other than avoiding spectral overlap are driving calling activity in tropical savannah frog communities. The call level avoidance found in this study may be sufficient for spectrally overlapping species pairs to avoid the negative effects of acoustic interference, allowing them to call during the same nights and at similar times to take advantage of favourable environmental conditions.

AB Dominance hierarchies reduce the costs of competitive aggression in social animals, and testosterone is a proposed mediator of aggressive behaviour and social dominance. While the effects of testosterone on male behaviour are well studied, effects on female aggression and dominance within mixed-sex groups are less clear. We tested how short-term testosterone treatment influences aggressive behaviour and dominance hierarchies in the common waxbill, Estrilda astrild, a bird with mild social hierarchies. In captive mixed-sex groups, we administered intramuscular testosterone to either males or females and, using a test of competition for food, compared aggressive behaviour and social dominance to those of a control treatment (saline) with no testosterone administered. Testosterone treatment to males increased their social dominance, without increasing aggression. We observed a decrease in female aggression towards treated males, suggesting that females were reacting to subtle cues of male dominance (e.g. vocal cues). In contrast, female treatment with testosterone did not increase their dominance, which could either be due to a lack of effect on females, or because males reacted to and opposed cues of female dominance. Together, our results indicate a sex-dependent role of testosterone on social hierarchies. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A growing body of observational and experimental data in nonhuman primates has highlighted the presence of rudimentary call combinations within the vocal communication system of monkeys. Such evidence suggests the ability to combine meaning-bearing units into larger structures, a key feature of language also known as syntax, could have its origins rooted within the primate lineage. However, the evolutionary progression of this trait remains ambiguous as evidence for similar combinations in great apes, our closest-living relatives, is sparse and incomplete. In this study, we aimed to bridge this gap by analysing the combinatorial properties of the pant hoot-food call combination in our closest-living relative, the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes. To systematically investigate the syntactic-like potential of this structure, we adopted three levels of analysis. First, we applied collocation analyses, methods traditionally used in language sciences, to confirm the combination of pant hoots with food calls was not a random co-occurrence, but instead a consistently produced structure. Second, using acoustic analyses, we confirmed pant hoots and food calls comprising the combination were acoustically indistinguishable from the same calls produced in isolation, indicating the pant hoot-food call combination is composed of individually occurring meaning-bearing units, a key criterion of linguistic syntax. Finally, we investigated the context-specific nature of this structure, demonstrating that the call combination was more likely to be produced when feeding on larger patches and when a high-ranking individual joined the feeding party. Together our results converge to provide support for the systematic combination of calls in chimpanzees. We highlight that playback experiments are vital to robustly disentangle both the function this combination might serve and the similarities with combinations of meaning-bearing units (i.e. syntax) in language.

AB Recent research into the navigational strategies of homing pigeons, Columba livia, in the familiar area has highlighted the phenomenon of route fidelity: birds forming idiosyncratic flight paths to which they are loyal over multiple releases from the same site, and even returning to this path when released from a nearby unfamiliar location. Such results highlight the potential importance of visual landmark cues in the homing process. However, not all birds have been found to produce idiosyncratic routes or show this route-joining behaviour. Here we used birds with and without flight experience to study the formation of idiosyncratic routes when released repeatedly from a single location, followed by two off-route releases with differing topography to see how flight experience and local landmark features can influence navigational strategy in the familiar area. We found that, over the course of 20 sequential releases, birds with greater flight experience tended to form idiosyncratic routes whereas less experienced birds did not show this tendency. When released from nearby sites (from which the birds had not previously been released), a range of navigational strategies were seen, including flying parallel to the learned route (suggestive of a learned compass direction), a direct flight path towards home (again indicative of compass use), rejoining the learned route and following the coastline. These latter strategies are suggestive of landmark usage. Analysis using time lag embedding was also used to assess the off-route releases, and the short-term correlation dimension values produced were also indicative of strategies using one or two factors (landmarks, compass or a combination of these two). Individual birds often showed different strategies at different sites, suggesting that the use of different navigational cues is highly flexible and situationally dependent.

AB Because habitats present different costs and benefits in contexts ranging from foraging to mating to predator avoidance, decisions about habitat use likely involve significant trade-offs across behavioural contexts. We examine this possibility in Schizocosa floridana, a cursorial wolf spider whose habitat consists of multiple substrates, including oak and pine litter, and sand. However, S. floridana restricts its use of habitat to oak litter. Substrate environments vary significantly in the degree to which they transmit visual and vibratory information. Previous work found that oak litter best transmits the substrate-borne vibrations that are critical to mating communication. However, oak litter may reduce the availability of visual information, which is known to be important for prey capture in other wolf spider species. Here, we test the relationship between substrate and prey capture efficiency in S. floridana. We examine substrate use in a foraging context via two laboratory-based experiments to (1) assess differences in prey capture efficiency among the three most common substrates in the field and to (2) determine which sensory modalities are involved in prey capture. We found that prey capture rates were highest on sand despite the fact that sand is the least used substrate by S. floridana in the wild. We also found no conclusive evidence that either the visual or the vibratory sensory modalities are critical for prey capture. Our results thus suggest that strict habitat specialization such as that exhibited by S. floridana is beneficial in some ecological contexts but costly in others.

AB Temporal coordination of duets consists of nonrandom overlap, alternation or association between rhythms of acoustic elements. Since duet coordination presumably requires high attentiveness between signallers, the coalition quality hypothesis suggests it may indicate the ability or motivation of partners to engage cooperatively in aggressive interactions against intruders. To test this hypothesis, we monitored behavioural as well as vocal responses in a playback experiment conducted with a polyphonal duetting bird, the rufous hornero, Furnarius rufus. We used three categories of treatments in the experiment, which totalled six treatments: duet playbacks that varied in phrase overlap and coordination of temporal rhythms; nonoverlapped (consecutive) solos; and a control heterospecific song. We predicted that birds would respond more strongly to playbacks of coordinated duets than to uncoordinated duets, and also to playbacks of uncoordinated duets than to nonoverlapping male and female solo songs. Coordinated duets (degree of phrase overlap) provoked the weakest response across conspecific stimuli, whereas the responses to uncoordinated duets and nonoverlapped solos were similar. However, partners produced more highly coordinated duets (degree of phrase overlap) in response to coordinated duets (association of phrase rhythms), when compared to all other stimuli. These results suggest that territorial pairs not only perceive but also alter their degree of temporal coordination of duets during territorial interactions. In addition, partners seem to behave cautiously and with more coordinated duets when responding to paired intruders that produce coordinated duets. Our results partially support the coalition quality hypothesis, suggesting that duet coordination may indicate the ability of partners to cooperatively engage in aggressive interactions.

AB Many social networks exhibit community structure, where individuals form discrete subgroups. The composition of such groupings is important for numerous research directions, but their characterization is challenged by data sampling issues. In wild populations, where individuals range over large distances and observation can be limited, social data required to resolve community structure are difficult to collect. Recent studies used simulated data sets to determine the robustness of individual level network metrics under suboptimal sampling conditions, but the sensitivity of community detection algorithms to imperfect sampling has not been assessed. Here, we used simulated data sets to determine how sampling effort and skew influence the ability of three community detection algorithms (fastgreedy, walktrap and louvain) to recover the ?true? community structure of networks under two sampling regimes (field-based observational sampling and sampling through biologgers, e.g. proximity detectors). We also examined the robustness of a measure of uncertainty in estimated community structure (rcom). We based our simulated societies on contact patterns in wild male African elephants, a model system reflecting common sampling challenges of large wild populations. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the algorithms improved with increasing sampling effort and decreasing sampling skew. Under the field sampling regime, when sampling effort is constrained, mid-levels of sampling skew may provide a reasonable compromise between maximizing the mean numbers of observation per individual and minimizing sampling skew. Even with skewed data, rcom can provide a reliable measure of uncertainty in the estimated community assignments, but it should be interpreted cautiously with highly skewed data. The network structures explored represent common sampling challenges for wild populations, but unexplored sampling regimes may drive somewhat different dynamics. Our simulations indicate that adequate sampling even when skewed can be informative and maximization of the number of observations among all individuals should be a general objective. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Prey increase vigilance to maximize predator detection, but this comes at the expense of foraging depending on the vigilance type: (1) intense vigilance, when all feeding processes are ceased, and (2) routine vigilance, when animals continue chewing (i.e. lower foraging cost). Few studies have distinguished between vigilance types when examining the effects of predation risk and, in the absence of a commonly accepted conceptual framework, the variables used to define predation risk vary greatly between studies. We investigated the relative importance of four predation risk categories (risky place assessed at the landscape and habitat level, vegetation characteristics at foraging site level, prey characteristics and resource availability) for the time spent on intense and routine vigilance by Burchell's zebra, Equus quagga burchellii, and blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus taurinus, under predation risk from reintroduced predators, lions, Panthera leo. The risk categories each represented a different predation risk component and included metrics that defined the component at multiple scales. Intense vigilance responses were scale dependent, with zebra responding to a risky place at the landscape level and wildebeest to vegetation characteristics at a foraging area scale. Yet both species were able to adjust and balance time spent on vigilance types. Prey characteristics reduced the intense vigilance of wildebeest as herd size increased. Both species maintained similar levels of intense vigilance between seasons, despite lower resource availability, and thus higher foraging costs, in the dry season. However, the reduction in grass quality probably resulted in the increase in routine vigilance by both species during the dry season, as more time was needed to chew grasses with high fibre content. Our findings suggest different underlying mechanisms for the two types of vigilance behaviour, which were influenced by the ecology of the species, and demonstrate the importance of distinguishing vigilance types in predation risk studies.

   COMBINATIONS
AB Prey around the world experience the risk of predation, and most have evolved constitutive and phenotypically plastic defences in response. Phenotypically plastic defences often come with trade-offs related to foraging, such that the magnitude of defence is mediated by body condition and food availability. Such adaptive responses are beneficial to prey, and there is an increasing appreciation that they can be disrupted by chemical compounds resulting from human activities. We examined predatorinduced behaviours in freshwater snails (Physa acuta) using 32 combinations of different concentrations of olfactory predator cues, body condition and food availability to understand how they respond to the trade-off between avoiding predators and obtaining food. Using a subset of these conditions (16 environments), we then examined how snail responses were altered by increases or decreases in pH. We found that snails responded to increased predator cue concentrations with a shape consistent with a saturating response curve and that low body condition and low food availability weakened these responses. When we increased pH (from 7.8 to 9.5), snails exhibited weaker predator avoidance responses, but only in the absence of food. When we decreased pH (from 7.8 to 6.0), snails exhibited stronger predator avoidance responses and stronger declines in foraging, but only in the presence of food. Collectively, these results suggest that changes in pH due to acid mine drainage, eutrophication and ocean acidification may substantially alter the adaptive responses of aquatic animals. Future work should determine whether such info-disruption is common in other taxa, determine the underlying mechanisms and quantify the consequences of info-disruption to predatoreprey and preyeresource interactions.

AB Individuals sometimes exhibit striking constancy to a single behaviour even when they are capable of short-term behavioural flexibility. Constancy enables animals to avoid costs such as memory constraints, but can also inflict significant opportunity costs through behaviour-environment mismatch. It is unclear when individuals should exhibit behavioural constancy and which types of costs most strongly influence such behaviour. We use a case in which individuals within a population exhibit more than one handling tactic for a single food type to investigate whether costs associated with switching among tactics constrain expression of intra-individual variation. Using wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) that feed on nectar through flower openings (legitimate visits) or through holes at the base of flowers (robbing), we asked three questions. (1) Do individual bees exhibit tactic constancy within and across foraging bouts? (2) Are individuals willing to switch their food-handling tactics? (3) Is constancy in food-handling tactics maintained by costs associated with switching tactics? We measured energetic costs in addition to handling times. We found that bees freely foraging in meadows were highly constant to a single foodhandling tactic both within and across bouts. However, experiments with individual captive bees showed that these bees were willing to switch tactics and experienced minimal costs in doing so. Thus, switching costs do not drive the observed constancy in food-handling tactics of bumble bees within and across foraging bouts. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Predation success depends on factors such as hunger, prey size, prey availability and intensity of competition. A neglected factor that may also influence predation success is the proper function of morphological traits related to prey search, capture and manipulation. Injuries that compromise the functionality of these morphological traits may reduce predation success. In many invertebrates, autotomy can compromise predation success because the detached body part may be crucial for hunting. However, empirical evidence linking autotomy and predation success is relatively scarce. We filled this gap using the scorpion Ananteris balzani, which autotomizes the last abdominal segments, known as the 'tail'. This is a unique form of autotomy as 'tail' autotomy implies the loss of the stinger, an organ used for venom inoculation, which is the main form of large prey subjugation. Using a paired experimental design, we found that for both small and large prey, subduing success was higher when individuals were intact than when they were autotomized. After autotomy, subduing success of male scorpions decreased from 90% to 17% for small prey and from 47% to 1% for large prey. Subduing success of female scorpions after autotomy decreased from 98% to 93% for small prey and from 97% to 70% for large prey. Autotomized individuals took longer than intact individuals to subdue both small and large prey, but the effect size was higher for large prey. Considering that the tail does not regenerate, autotomized individuals (especially males) will experience a lifelong reduction in trophic niche breadth because their diet will be mostly composed of small prey. Moreover, autotomized individuals probably move more to enhance the likelihood of finding small prey, which may increase their exposure to predators and consequently the costs related to tail loss.

AB Studies on the strategic rules used by fighting animals usually attempt to categorize fights as falling into one of two discrete types: self-assessment and mutual assessment. With self-assessment, losers give up when they cross an individual costs threshold, without reference to the fighting ability (resource-holding potential, RHP) of their opponent, while in mutual assessment, losers compare their own RHP to that of their opponent and give up if and when they determine themselves to be the weaker rival. However, it has recently been suggested that this discontinuous view of variation in assessment strategy might be an oversimplification. This is because use of information on self-RHP, opponent RHP and resource value is likely to show continuous variation across individuals, populations and species. While the possibility of this continuous variation is often ignored, we suggest that we can gain a better understanding of decision making during fights by considering the relative contributions of these three information sources to the giving-up decisions of losers. Here, we use ternary plots to demonstrate how the relative contribution of self-RHP, opponent RHP and resource value to decision rules can be illustrated using simulated and real contest data, as an aid to achieving greater depth in discussions of variation in assessment rules.

AB Vocal performance an animal's ability to produce physically challenging vocalizations can reflect a signaller's overall condition and can be a reliable signal of quality. It has been suggested recently that songbirds improve vocal performance through recent practice during intense dawn singing. We tested whether recent practice improves vocal performance in swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana, a species for which the biomechanical constraints and biological implications of vocal performance are well established. We measured vocal deviation - a measure of performance - in 1527 songs recorded from 11 captive swamp sparrows, four of which were developmentally stressed as juveniles. Vocal performance improved across the morning as a function of both the cumulative number of songs previously performed and the time of day. Song types with introductory syllables showed greater improvement than more typical song types composed solely of trilled syllables, and across all song types, as song output increased, the average improvement in vocal performance also increased. However, males with high song output exhibited greater variability in vocal performance, suggesting that some individuals might experience fatigue in song production. Furthermore, birds that had been developmentally stressed as juveniles showed greater improvement over the morning than birds that were not stressed. If con specifics attend to within-individual variation in vocal performance, then improvement in vocal performance over the course of a day may drive birds to sing early and often, although fatigue may limit the extent to which this advantage may be gained.

AB The storage of food is widespread among mammals and birds and can be flexibly adjusted to various contexts such as competition, food availability or energetic demands. In bird species, nonbreeders often move through large areas whereby periods of long-term settlement can alternate with short-term visits. In food-caching species these differences in the degree of local settlement might change the benefits gained from storing food, and caching may only be advantageous during periods of prolonged settlement. We examined whether differences in local settlement influence food-caching behaviour of wild common ravens at a local anthropogenic food source with high interspecific and intraspecific competition. We found that individuals with a higher degree of site fidelity (i.e. prolonged periods of local settlement) engaged in food caching more than individuals with less site fidelity (i.e. short periods of local settlement); this effect was even stronger in the presence of potential predators representing a high-risk foraging situation. Further, juvenile ravens were less likely to cache than subadults and adults, and an increasing number of conspecifics present at the feeding site decreased the likelihood of caching. We found considerable individual variation in respect to the area used for caching. We suggest that individuals with higher site fidelity may gain more benefits from caching food and/or that they are more successful in obtaining food potentially due to more experience with the local foraging situation. Research is needed to examine the exact causes of the observed link between food-caching behaviour and the different degrees of site fidelity. Our findings show that differences in movement and settlement decisions can influence ecological aspects such as food acquisition and thus may have important consequences for individual fitness and population dynamics.

AB All activity imposes costs, but animals can often alter the timing of their activity to reduce these costs. Metabolic costs of activity are especially high during seasons of energy deficits (such as winter), but the extent to which animals can adjust their activity timing to reduce metabolic costs is unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that the timing of small mammal activity during winter minimizes heat loss. Using motion-activated cameras deployed under snow, we show that a widely distributed nocturnal small mammal species (white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus) shifted to diurnal activity in early winter, which reduced potential heat loss by 4%. The southern red-backed vole, Myodes gapperi, also avoided cold temperatures, but did so by adjusting its activity timing at a broader temporal scale by minimizing activity on cold days. We conclude that plasticity in activity timing - at both 24 h and multiday temporal scales - is an important means of conserving energy during winter and may need to be accounted for when forecasting species distributions, abundances and interactions.

AB Laterality is the prevalence of one side of the body to perform motor acts and perceptual functions. The evolution of directional biases that are consistent across individuals of a group may have been constrained by the opportunity for asymmetric animals to interact with other asymmetric animals. If we assume that social animals have more opportunity to interact with each other than solitary animals, we could expect that the more social animals are, the more lateralized and the more aligned they are. In precocial birds, the mother is the first and most important social partner and she has a strong influence on her offspring's social motivation. We therefore wondered whether she could also influence its laterality. To see whether mothering influences the chick's laterality, we compared behaviours of nonbrooded and brooded domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus. We assessed both individual and group level laterality during the mothering period. We also measured sociality and emotivity of both types of chicks. We found that nonbrooded chicks were more strongly lateralized, more social and less emotional than brooded chicks. Asymmetrical bias was also more consistent across nonbrooded chicks than across brooded chicks. These results show a postnatal influence of mothering on the development of laterality in the domestic chick, and a link between laterality and sociality. Several hypotheses could explain how the mother's presence and behaviour can modify her offspring's laterality. We need to test these hypotheses to uncover the mechanisms that are at play. The influence of mothering on the lateralization of young may have implications in both individual and group performance and fitness. Studying it further may therefore help us to understand better the evolution of laterality and its potential benefits. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Correlational selection is defined as selection for adaptive character combinations, and it therefore favours combinations of coevolved traits via phenotypic integration. Whereas the evolution of avian nest-building and egg-laying characteristics are well understood, their correlated dynamics remain overlooked. Here, we examined patterns of correlated evolution between nest, egg and clutch characteristics in 855 species of birds from 90 families, representing nearly 9% and 33% of avian species- and family-level diversity. We show that the ancestral state of birds' nests was semi-open with nest sites having since become progressively more open over time. Furthermore, nest characteristics appear to have influenced egg-laying patterns in that while semi-open nests with variable clutch sizes were probably ancestral, clutch sizes have declined over evolutionary time in both open and closed nests. Ancestrally, avian eggs were also large, heavy and either elliptic or round, and there have been high transition rates from elliptic to round eggs in open nests and vice versa in closed nests. Ancestrally, both unpigmented (white) and pigmented (blue-brown) eggs were laid in open nests, although blue-brown eggs have transitioned more to white over time in open and closed nests, independently. We conclude that there has been a remarkable level of correlated evolution between the nest and egg characteristics of birds, which supports scenarios of correlational selection on both of these extended avian phenotypes.

AB In social groups, competition often gives rise to conflicts, which are regulated through a variety of mechanisms. In several social insect species, the conflict for male production that takes place between workers after queen loss, is regulated through the establishment of a reproductive hierarchy. A recent study of Neoponera apicalis showed that workers differ in their fertility levels in the presence of the queen and proposed that such idiosyncratic differences might influence access to the top of the hierarchy after queen loss. In this study, we therefore sought to characterize the influence of the initial heterogeneity in ovarian development and its chemical and behavioural correlates on the establishment of reproductive hierarchies among orphaned workers, which can only produce males. We monitored the chemical profile before and after hierarchy establishment in four groups of orphaned workers of N. apicalis morph 6. The analysis of the cuticular profiles showed that tricosane (n-C-23) was highly correlated with ovarian development and could consequently act as a fertility signal in this ant. The relative amount of tricosane on the cuticle, both before and after the establishment of the hierarchy, was also correlated with the rank achieved within the hierarchy and with the expression of agonistic behaviours. Thus, our study experimentally shows that idiosyncratic differences in a putative fertility signal (and therefore presumably in ovarian activity) between workers in the queen's presence reliably predict the outcome of reproductive conflict after queen loss. We propose that this signal (together with an increased agonistic motivation of the more fertile workers) could play a major role in the regulation of dominance/submission behaviours, enabling the most fertile individuals to rapidly access top ranks and monopolize reproduction, thereby maximizing the global reproductive success of all colony workers while minimizing the costs associated with the expression of agonistic behaviour.

AB It is thought that the more conspicuous a sexual signal, the more attractive it is; however, the role of the background in modifying the conspicuousness of a signal is not well understood, particularly for complex, highly polymorphic colour signals. The background against which a sexual signal is viewed is important because it can influence how an individual's colour pattern is perceived and therefore whether it is attractive to potential mates. Here, we tested the hypothesis that against-background contrast in hue (colour), luminance (brightness) and chroma (saturation) will influence the attractiveness of a male and we predicted that the more a male's colour pattern contrasts with the background, the more attractive he should be. We used mate choice tests to determine the effect of visual background contrast on female preferences in a freshwater fish, Poecilia reticulata, with a highly polymorphic male colour sexual signal. We placed three full-sibling males, with very similar colour patterns, in front of three different backgrounds which varied in their perceived contrast to females. We then gave females the opportunity to spend time with the male that they found most attractive. Contrary to our predictions, we found that females did not choose the males that contrasted the most with their background. More specifically, we found nonlinear relationships between female preference and the coefficient of variation (CV) of chromatic contrast, which represents the variation in colour patch saturation across the pattern; the higher the CV chroma, the more the colour patches within a pattern vary in saturation. Our results indicate possible trade-offs between natural and sexual selection and/or signatures of sensory bias. Against-background contrast may play a role in maintaining colour pattern polymorphism. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vocal signals are important in territoriality and mate attraction across animal taxa. Vocalizations are particularly elaborate in some groups, such as songbirds, which learn their songs, but much remains to be known about the physiological mechanisms that produce variation, especially in vocalizations of nonlearners. We address the extent that androgen treatment of female and juvenile golden-collared manakins, Manacus vitellinus, activate the male-like 'thee-poo' vocalization to determine (1) the extent that the vocal circuitry is developed and sensitive to androgens in females and (2) to identify the characteristics, including finer acoustic features, of vocal behaviour that are influenced by androgens in females and young males. We analysed recordings of nonbreeding females and juvenile males given implants containing testosterone (T) or blank implants during a period of 3 weeks in an outdoor aviary in Panama. T-treated females, but not control females, produced chee-poos, and their vocalizations showed consistent differences in acoustic features from those of males. This indicates that the neuromuscular systems are well developed or relatively rapidly developed in response to T administration in females. Both T-treated and control juvenile males produced chee-poos, although vocal production was higher in the treatment group. Surprisingly, T treatment of juvenile males resulted in chee-poos with increased acoustic similarity to those of females, such as increased duration and frequency bandwidth. These features may indicate an important role for chee-poos in aggressive interactions. Future work will address the contributions of central and peripheral components in vocal variation in golden-collared manakins. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Variable selection pressures on individuals contribute to the occurrence of distinct phenotypes within species. Rapidly changing environmental conditions due to climate change are likely to alter these selection pressures and hence the current balance between phenotypes within species. In birds, colour polymorphism has been related to alternative behavioural strategies, potentially underlying different responses to extreme environmental conditions between colour morphs. Here, we examined how red-and black-headed Gouldian finches, Erythrura gouldiae, responded to experimentally induced heatwaves of different intensities by measuring their feeding behaviour, their response to novelty and their behavioural reactivity. As red-headed birds have been described as physiologically more plastic than black-headed birds, we expected them to alter their behaviour more strongly in response to heatwaves. Even though black-headed males fed overall less than other birds (thereby suggesting lower energy requirements), differences in feeding behaviour between morphs remained unaffected by thermal conditions. However, birds' response to novelty varied between morphs under variable thermal conditions. Indeed, before thermal treatment, black-headed birds, irrespective of their sex, spent less time near a novel object than red-headed birds, thereby suggesting lower novelty interest. However, because only red-headed birds reduced the time spent close to a novel object during heatwaves, differences in novelty interest between morphs disappeared under these thermal conditions. These results suggest that behavioural plasticity in response to thermal conditions differ between colour morphs of Gouldian finches, thereby showing that behavioural differences between morphs are not static. How such behavioural adjustments within species affect the balance between colour morphs in natural populations facing extreme environmental conditions remains to be determined.

AB Recent research reveals that female reproductive competition is common and may shape the social and reproductive strategies of female mammals. This study explores the determinants and intensity of female intrasexual conflicts in a wild promiscuous primate, the chacma baboon, Papio ursinus. We tested a suite of hypotheses to assess whether female-female aggression was primarily driven by instantaneous competition for food, mates or paternal care, or aimed at reducing future competition among offspring via reproductive suppression. Behavioural data were gathered from 53 females in two groups over two contrasting 2-year periods (2005-2006, 2013-2014): the first characterized by stability in the male dominance hierarchies, the second by instability induced by several immigration events and male takeovers. In both periods, we found that sexually receptive females received high levels of aggression from other sexually receptive females, consistent with competition over mating opportunities. In the unstable period, females exchanged higher rates of aggression than in the stable period, regardless of reproductive state, but lactating females received most aggression, consistent with higher competition over social access to male partners in response to increased infanticide risk. There was no evidence that aggression between females reflected either competition over food or reproductive suppression. These findings indicate that patterns of aggression between females fluctuate with sociodemographic factors affecting sexual and social access to males and reflect reproductive competition more closely than resource competition in this promiscuous primate society.

   PATTERNS; FITNESS
AB Natal dispersal is common in animals but the fitness cost of moving from the natal area is not well understood. One reason for a fitness cost is that foraging skills and prey preference learned early in life may be less efficient if the individual settles in a new, unfamiliar habitat. In a 4-year study, we found that immigrant parent blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, and great tits, Parus major, were inferior food providers compared to local recruits. In blue tits, immigrants provided smaller prey items than local recruits, whereas in great tits, the immigrants provided fewer green larvae, but relatively more brown larvae, to the offspring than local recruits. We also found that immigrant females laid later or smaller clutches than females locally recruited. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that natal dispersal carries costs related to the learning of foraging skills. However, alternative explanations are that the differences were caused by genetic and/or quality differences between the two groups of birds. We discuss various ecological and behavioural traits that may influence, and be influenced by, the mismatch of foraging between natal and breeding habitats. In altricial birds, yearlings will not have previous foraging experience during breeding and, in addition, immigrants will not have spent a long postfledging period in the new local habitat with their parents. If there are foraging-habitat mismatches as a result of dispersal, researchers should include natal origin in models of optimal foraging, time budgets, reproductive success and survival because performance may be directly related to the early learning environment rather than genetic differences.

AB Exposure of prey animals to high background risk environments generates high-risk behavioural phenotypes characterized by prey that often display transient neophobic responses to novel stimuli. To manipulate background risk, researchers have most often used chemical alarm cues from injured con-specifics because these cues provide a general indication of a high-risk environment but no information regarding the identity of the source of the threat. Here, we hypothesized that the expression of neophobia (fear of unknown stimuli) may not be the result of elevated background risk per se, but rather the result of high uncertainty associated with the predation environment. Here we showed that woodfrog, Lithobates sylvaticus, tadpoles exposed to alarm cues alone for several days subsequently displayed neophobic phenotypes. The same was true for tadpoles exposed to alarm cues paired with the odour of a new novel predator each day for several days. However, tadpoles exposed to alarm cues paired with the same predator cue everyday did not develop the neophobic phenotype. This suggests that if the predator environment is certain (i.e. the alarm cue and predator cues always coincide), then the ratio of costs to benefits of neophobia is high and limits its expression. However, if the prey's uncertainty regarding the predator environment is high (i.e. the alarm cues are often associated with new unknown predators), then the potential survival benefits of expressing neophobia likely override the costs. The prey's perception of uncertainty may be a key driver of the expression of neophobic phenotypes. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB When males compete for mates, they often defend paternity through mate guarding. In addition to physical guarding, in vocal species, especially duetting birds, individuals may duet with their mates in order to guard them. The acoustic mate-guarding hypothesis posits that duetting deters rivals. We experimentally tested the effectiveness of physical and acoustic mate guarding in a duetting songbird, the red-backed fairy-wren, Malurus melanocephalus, using a novel variation of a classic removal experiment. We temporarily removed males, such that females received either no guarding (mate removed), or only acoustic guarding (mate removed, his duet response played from speaker). We found that rival intrusion rates were highest when all guarding was prevented, slightly lower when only acoustic guarding occurred and lowest when pairs were unmanipulated, and both physical and acoustic guarding occurred. This suggests that both guarding techniques deter intruders, but acoustic guarding less so. Intruder display rate during removals was higher than in unmanipulated trials, regardless of acoustic guarding. Results suggest that acoustic guarding may function as a long-range signal that reduces the likelihood of rival intrusion, but physical guarding is necessary to prevent rivals from courting mates. We confirm that physical and acoustic mate guarding serve as important components of intruder deterrence, although they act at different levels. Our study broadens our understanding of multimodal paternity assurance strategies. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Investigating the mechanisms underlying individual variation in cognitive performance is a crucial step towards understanding the structure and evolution of cognition. In this study, we investigated phenotypic plasticity of 61 Bornean, Pongo pygmaeus, and Sumatran, Pongo abelii, orang-utans to gain insight into how rearing history shapes problem-solving approaches. We first examined the determinants of an individual's response-and-exploration style, which we assessed using five independent novelty response and exploration tasks. Our findings revealed that both previous care by humans and social housing with conspecifics elicited a curious response-and-exploration style (characterized by a positive response to novelty and a high motivation to explore). Second, we investigated how the response-and-exploration style and previous experiences affected an individual's problem-solving performance in a variety of tasks aimed at assessing physical cognition, including reversal learning, inhibitory control, causal reasoning and tool use. We found curiosity to be the sole predictor of problem-solving performance. However, curiosity is strikingly rare in wild orang-utans, being mainly induced by contact with humans and living in a safe and stimulating physical and social environment. We therefore suggest that curiosity in orang-utans is an artefact of captivity, a potential only expressed under special conditions. The origin of curiosity in our own lineage may have been an important contributor to the rapid rise in the complexity of our ancestors' material culture.

AB Evolutionary theory predicts that parents should bias investment in offspring towards the sex that will yield the higher fitness returns, and one outcome may be biased offspring sex ratios. Bias in offspring sex ratios has been proposed to vary with specific social, maternal and environmental conditions that alter the fitness returns of each sex, but empirical evidence is conflicting both within and across taxa. We used 18 years of pedigree and demographic data to investigate variation in offspring sex ratios in a population of golden-mantled ground squirrels. Despite overall parity in offspring sex ratio, we found predictable changes in offspring sex ratio in response to female density at the population level: squirrels produced more daughters when female density was low and more sons when female density was high. At the individual level, females adjusted litter sex ratios similarly, but only in response to high densities of kin, and not in response to density of nonkin. This effect was reversed for older females (>= 3 years) in dense kin neighbourhoods, which were more likely to produce daughters, perhaps because older females had the behavioural dominance necessary to recruit daughters at high densities. By contrast, litter sex ratios did not vary with maternal condition or food availability. Our results support the local resource competition theory of offspring sex allocation for this species. Knowledge of female relatedness revealed patterns of sex ratio adjustment that otherwise would have been obscured, highlighting the importance of interactions with kin in an asocial species.

AB Social groups may experience permanent changes in adult composition. While field-based studies suggest this form of social instability may convey costs to the females, factors underlying these effects remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether social instability experienced by pregnant females influences the ability of female group members other than the mother to buffer offspring experiencing socially stressful postnatal conditions. We also examined whether social instability influences communal care by females within groups. Groups of three adult degu, Octodon degus, females were assigned to one of two conditions: social stability (no changes in group composition) or social instability (changes in group composition during pregnancy). Upon birth of litters, offspring in the social instability groups were challenged with removal of their mother, removal of nonbreeding females or removal of all adult females for 2 h daily. We quantified social interactions among adult females and care given to the offspring. Upon weaning, the stress response to standard restraint and handling, and growth rate of offspring were quantified. Neither social instability nor postnatal social challenge influenced stress reactivity of offspring. Offspring in stable groups grew faster than offspring in unstable groups except when offspring experienced daily removal of their mother. Thus, the ability of mothers to buffer offspring growth seems contingent upon experiencing socially stable conditions, and in the absence of the mother, nonbreeding females were unable to buffer offspring. Nonbreeding females of socially unstable groups exhibited less alloparental care, and thus, offspring of unstable groups received less parental care overall. Our findings indicate that social instability in groups of degus negatively affects alloparental care and offspring quality. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Divorce occurs when both members of a breeding pair survive to the following year but then pair with other individuals instead of reuniting. Divorce is common in birds, but its frequency can vary widely both between and within species, or even between populations across years. Several explanations for divorce have been described, both adaptive and nonadaptive. Many studies have compared the breeding success of faithful and divorced individuals, but fewer have considered the process of divorce, i. e. the events that lead up to divorce. In this study, we used data from eight breeding seasons to investigate divorce in a population of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, in southern Germany. To compare our results to previous work, we first describe the frequency of divorce and compare the breeding success of divorced and faithful pairs. We then use data from an RFID transponder-based system, where all visits of individuals to any nestbox in the study site are automatically recorded throughout the year, to compare the behaviour of pairs in the interbreeding period. We found that the probability of divorce was not affected by breeding success in Year X. However, divorce was predicted by the difference in arrival time to the study site between the members of Year X pairs. Furthermore, during the interbreeding period, compared to their divorced counterparts, members of faithful pairs had more interactions with one another than with other individuals of the opposite sex. In Year X thorn 1, faithful females started egg laying earlier, had somewhat larger clutches and produced slightly more fledglings, than females that had divorced. We propose that divorce in blue tits is a by-product of separation of the two pair members after the Year X breeding season, leading to asynchrony in the timing of settlement and pair formation in Year X thorn 1.

AB Despite sharing nearly the same genome, individuals within the same species can vary drastically in both morphology and behaviour as a function of developmental stage, sex or developmental plasticity. Thus, regulatory processes must exist that enable the stage-, sex-or environment-specific expression of traits and their integration during ontogeny, yet exactly how trait complexes are co-regulated and integrated is poorly understood. In this study, we explore the developmental genetic basis of the regulation and integration of environment-dependent sexual dimorphism in behaviour and morphology in the horn-polyphenic dung beetle Onthophagus taurus through the experimental manipulation of the transcription factor doublesex (dsx). The gene dsx plays a profound role in the developmental regulation of morphological differences between sexes as well as alternative male morphs by inhibiting horn formation in females but enabling nutrition-responsive horn growth in males. Specifically, we investigated whether experimental downregulation of dsx expression affects male and female aggressive and courtship behaviours in two social contexts: interactions between individuals of the same sex and interactions between males and females. We find that dsx downregulation significantly alters aggressiveness in both males and females, yet does so differently for both sexes as a function of social context: dsx(RNAi) males exhibited elevated aggression towards males but showed reduced aggression towards females, whereas dsx(RNAi) females became more aggressive towards males, while their aggressiveness towards other females was unaffected. Moreover, we document unexpectedly high levels of female aggression independent of dsx treatment in both wild-type and control-injected individuals. Lastly, we found no effects of dsx(RNAi) on courtship and mating behaviours. We discuss the role of dsx in the regulation of sex-specific and plastic behaviours, the unexpectedly high levels of aggression of hornless dsx(RNAi) males in relation to the well-established description of the hornless sneaker phenotype and the potential ecological function of high female aggression.

AB Fidelity to a past breeding site is widespread among animals and may confer both costs and benefits. Colonial species occur at specific sites that can accommodate multiple breeders, and the choice of whether to return to last year's site or disperse elsewhere can affect colony site use, the colony size distribution and individual fitness. For the colonial cliff swallow, Petrochelidon pyrrhonota, which occupies colonies of widely different sizes, we used a 30-year field study in western Nebraska to investigate how the extent of infestation by ectoparasites and colony size affected breeders' colony site fidelity between years. We compared philopatry at colonies where parasitic swallow bugs, Oeciacus vicarius, had been removed by fumigation with that at nonfumigated sites exposed to natural levels of ectoparasites. About 25% of birds at nonfumigated colonies returned to their previous year's site, whereas about 69% of birds at fumigated colonies did so. Site fidelity was greatest at nonfumigated sites that changed the least in size between years. Birds were less likely to return to a nonfumigated site as the colony there became increasingly larger. Individuals philopatric to both nonfumigated and fumigated sites resided in colonies more similar in size between years than did dispersing birds. Most cliff swallows settled within 6 km of their previous year's site, indicating that many nonphilopatric birds still may have had some familiarity with the local landscape surrounding the site to which they moved. Removal of ectoparasites at a site allows large colonies to persist there perennially, probably contributing to higher philopatry because such large colonies are rare and would have been difficult to find had the residents dispersed. Cliff swallows are likely to be sensitive to both colony size and general familiarity with a given site or landscape region, and probably integrate these with other cues to select breeding colonies.

AB Animal behaviours, like aggression, can directly affect host health by influencing exposure to parasites. Aggressive individuals may experience an increase in agonistic interactions and contact rates with conspecifics, which might increase their probability of acquiring parasites. However, aggression is not the only factor that shapes parasitism; proximate mechanisms like hormone-modulated immunosuppression can also have broad impacts. Here, we hypothesized that high levels of aggression, cortisol and testosterone would be positively associated with parasitism and that aggressive individuals would play a larger role spreading parasites to conspecifics than would docile individuals. We measured aggression using the level of aggressive response to human handling during capture. Our aim was to examine associations between aggression and hormones (cortisol and testosterone) on variation in endo-and ectoparasitism in a population of wild mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus) over a 3-year period. By tracking the movement of lice (directly transmitted parasites) in the population, we also examined the effect of host aggression on population-wide parasite dynamics. We show that animals with high testosterone and cortisol were more likely to exhibit aggressive behaviours, and cortisol was associated with significantly higher ectoparasite infestations. Aggressive individuals were significantly more infested by lice, and also donated significantly more lice to conspecifics in the population. Taken together, our results offer insight into the individual and population health costs of aggression, and empirical support of a trade-off between aggression and ectoparasitism, which may have driven the evolution of aggression and interactions with conspecifics.

AB Complex social life is thought to be a major driver of complex cognition in primates, but few studies have directly tested the relationship between a given primate species' social system and their social cognitive skills. We experimentally compared life span patterns of a foundational social cognitive skill (following another's gaze) in tolerant Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, and despotic rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta. Semi-free-ranging monkeys (N = 80 individuals from each species) followed gaze more in test trials where an actor looked up compared to control trials. However, species differed in ontogenetic trajectories: both exhibited high rates of gaze following as juveniles, but rhesus monkeys exhibited declines in social attention with age, whereas Barbary macaques did not. This pattern indicates that developmental patterns of social attention vary with social tolerance, and that diversity in social behaviour can lead to differences in social cognition across primates.

AB Parental care must respond to variation in environmental challenges and some of these challenges result from the altered niche during the evolution of care. One important variable is the quality of the resources for young. Burying beetles prepare small, vertebrate carcasses in varying states of decay as food for their young by removing hair, rounding and applying antimicrobial secretions. The present study examined carcass preparation (prehatch care), an elaborate behaviour whose benefits have been surprisingly difficult to demonstrate. Benefits were assessed by comparing brood success when a parent completed care using a fully prepared carcass or when using a substitute, same-age carcass that had not been prepared by a parent. The outcome was very different depending on whether the substitute carcass was intact (no holes) or had simulated feeding holes that a parent would normally make during the prehatch period. When Nicrophorus orbicollis utilized a prepared carcass, the brood mass was no greater than when using an intact, nonprepared carcass. When the substituted nonprepared carcass had simulated feeding holes, however, a prepared carcass resulted in a greater brood mass and heavier larvae on both fresh and aged carcasses. The importance of attending to holes opened in the carcass was clear from the rapid repair of experimentally introduced holes. While offspring fared worse when developing on an aged carcass, the parent's future reproduction and longevity were not compromised, suggesting that parents protect their future reproduction in a challenging environment. It is hypothesized that a primary benefit of resource handling in burying beetles is to minimize microbial activity at holes the parent must make in the carcass, a need that was amplified as carrion beetles evolved to breed on small, preempted carcasses without fly larvae as a nutritional resource.

AB There is an increased focus in biology on consistent behavioural variation. Several terms are used to describe this variation, including animal personality and coping style. Both terms describe between individual consistency in behavioural variation; however, they differ in the behavioural assays typically used, the expected distribution of response variables, and whether they incorporate variation in behavioural flexibility. Despite these differences, the terms are often used interchangeably. We conducted experiments using juvenile and adult red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, as subjects to explore the degree to which animal personality and coping styles overlap. We demonstrate that animal personality and coping styles can be described in this species, and that shyer individuals had more flexible responses, as expected for coping styles. Behavioural responses from both personality and coping style assays had continuous distributions, and were not clearly separated into two types. Behavioural traits were not correlated and, hence, there was no evidence of a behavioural syndrome. Further, behavioural responses obtained in personality assays did not correlate with those from coping style tests. Animal personality and coping styles are therefore not synonymous in the red junglefowl. We suggest that the terms animal personality and coping style are not equivalent and should not be used interchangeably. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Tool use in animals can be costly as foraging tools need to be actively searched for or manufactured. Consequently, some habitually tool-using species keep their tools safe and ` recycle' them for further use. We tested the Indonesian Goffin's cockatoo, a parrot with the capacity but no apparent adaptive specialization for tool use to investigate how tool safekeeping can arise innovatively. In this case, we further intended to test whether and how such safekeeping changes in different feeding contexts. We demonstrate that, in a set-up allowing for tool losses, the birds quickly started to keep their tools safe in between tool-using events. They used different individual strategies, suggesting that the behaviour was a product of innovation rather than inherited predispositions. The frequency of safekeeping improved over time indicating individual learning. Furthermore, the birds flexibly adjusted their performance depending on different contexts: paralleling previous results in the habitually tool-using New Caledonian crow, Corvus moneduloides, the cockatoos saved their tools more often when the foraging site was elevated and when the food item was easy rather than difficult to process. Furthermore, when feeding at heights, the birds tended to use a different safekeeping mode than when the foraging site was low. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Resting site selection can have important effects on the behaviour and fitness of organisms. The maintenance of optimal body temperatures (T-b) when faced with environmental variables has often been attributed to either specific microhabitat rest site characteristics or to behavioural strategies. Among many small group-living endotherms, social thermoregulation (i.e. huddling) is utilized as an energy conservation mechanism at low ambient temperatures (T-a), thus decreasing the metabolic cost of maintaining Tb. Although unusual among primates, lemurs maintain a low metabolic rate and exhibit a diversity of thermoregulatory strategies; however, objective Tb measurements have thus far been limited to small-bodied lemurs (e.g. Cheirogaleids). As such, we sought to determine whether a medium-sized lemur model, the southern bamboo lemur, Hapalemur meridionalis, would maintain thermoregulation through microhabitat rest site selection, huddling behaviour, or potentially both strategies. Within a degraded littoral forest fragment in southeast Madagascar, we conducted full-day focal observations on three groups of H. meridionalis between January and December 2013. Adult individuals were collared with data-loggers that collected instantaneous skin temperature T-sk (degrees C). We calculated the mean Tsk of the focal individual during each resting bout, and the proportional rate of huddling between the focal individual and conspecifics. In addition, we recorded all resting sites utilized for at least 15 min and collected standard tree characteristics. We fitted linear mixed-effects models to determine the thermoregulatory combined effect of specific resting site characteristics, huddling behaviour and environmental variables on Tsk. Our results showed that lemurs selected tree sites with larger diameter at breast height; however, huddling was most predictive of increasing Tsk whereas resting site characteristics were not included in the best-fit model. It is possible that microhabitat rest site selection is not significant in a degraded forest as the potential environmental buffering is limited; thus, thermoregulatory mechanisms are probably best served by behavioural strategies, i.e. social huddling.

AB Parental care is a key factor of breeding success and parents face evolutionary trade-offs between investment in current offspring and future reproduction and survival. Incubation in birds is energetically costly and the balance between parental and offspring's energetic needs is especially challenging when only one sex incubates, generally the female. In that case, males can contribute indirectly to incubation effort by feeding their mate and females may use begging behaviours to signal their needs to their visiting partner. The great tit, Parus major, is a good model species to test whether females use acoustic communication from the nest to signal their needs to their mate outside because females interact vocally with their mate during incubation. To test whether females use these vocal exchanges to communicate how hungry they are, great tit pairs were recorded on 2 days during incubation: 1 day with a feeder of mealworms in the nestbox and 1 day with an empty feeder. First, food supplementation increased females' nest attentiveness, revealing a decrease in foraging activity and consequently in females' needs. Second, females signalled their need for food both during their male's visits inside the nest but also during the vocal exchange immediately preceding the male's entrance by calling more and by modifying the frequency spectrum of their calls. So females' calling behaviour is an honest signal of need not only during their male's visits, but also before his entrance in the nest. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The cognitive abilities of prey animals are closely linked to previous experience with predation risk. For instance, under conditions of high background risk, prey often show an enhanced ability to learn the identity of new predators. When prey learn about predators, they often use the information to make decisions about the predatory nature of unknown, but similar, species. This is referred to as generalization of predator recognition. Often, prey show the strongest response to the species they learned, and a reduced response to other species, with the phylogenetic distance between the learned predator and the other species predicting the degree of generalization. Here, we assessed whether generalization of predator recognition by woodfrog tadpoles is influenced by background level of predation risk in the environment. Given that the likelihood of making a recognition mistake (i.e. failing to respond to an unknown species that is a predator) may be greater in a high-risk environment than in a low-risk environment, we predicted that prey in high risk environments may widen their generalization window and respond with the same intensity to the learned predator and novel predators that are closely related. We found strong evidence that background risk influences the intensity of antipredator responses that prey exhibit towards learned trout predators. Moreover, tadpoles generalized their recognition to closely related trout, but the degree of generalization was independent of background risk.

AB Evolutionary novelty can arise through the recombination of ancestral characters. In ants, colonies occasionally produce anomalous individuals that are mosaics of queen and worker characters. These intermediate individuals may be the first step in the evolution of new castes such as wingless queens and soldiers. While the morphological features of intercastes support this hypothesis, their rarity has meant their behaviour is unknown. In this study we carried out a behavioural study of 32 intercastes of Mystrium rogeri to assess whether they are a burden for their colonies, and whether their unusual morphologies are associated with consistent behavioural profiles and new functions. In addition, we measured dominance interactions within colonies, reproductive behaviours during dyadic encounters with males and aggressive interactions during dyadic encounters with heterospecific workers. We found that intercastes were active in colonies and that their behavioural profiles did not differ from those of virgin queens and workers. However, some intercastes were dominant, had developed ovaries and attracted males. One intercaste successfully mated and laid diploid eggs, demonstrating her reproductive potential. Moreover, we found that intercastes were as capable of fighting as workers because of their large size and could thus be useful for colony defence. Our results show that the production of intercastes in M. rogeri inflicts few costs but can yield benefits. Accordingly, certain ecological circumstances could select for increased frequency of intercaste production, ultimately resulting in the evolution of new reproductive and defensive castes.

AB Size hierarchies are often seen when nestlings hatch asynchronously over a period of days. Shorter hatch periods are common across passerines, however, and while these may also give rise to asymmetries, their effects are rarely considered. Regardless of hatch period, the long-term consequences for later hatched nestlings that survive to fledge is unknown for wild birds. Here we explored the timing of hatch order in a free-living population of hihi nestlings, Notiomystis cincta, and followed any effects in and out of the nest. We found that while hatching time from first-to last-hatched nestlings was often less than 24 h, last-hatched individuals grew more slowly and were lighter and smaller at fledging than older siblings. Last-hatched nestlings were also less likely to fledge. These effects were greater in larger broods. Adult body size is correlated with fledging size in hihi; however, we found no evidence that hatch order affected longevity postfledging, or lifetime reproductive success. We then explored whether carotenoid availability might buffer these stressful rearing conditions (through food supplementation of parents) but found no evidence that increased access to carotenoids for mothers and/or growing nestlings influenced incubation schedules, or the effects of hatching late. Together these results suggest that while even a very short hatch period can influence adult phenotype, hatching asynchrony is not maladaptive for hihi: when last-hatched nestlings survive to fledge they can contribute as much to their mothers' fitness as first-hatched siblings.

AB The costs of signalling are often expressed in terms of increased predation risk to the signaller; however, whether signalling predators also incur costs due to eavesdropping by prey and may attempt to reduce these costs is less well studied. In this study, we investigated whether there is a trade-off between intraspecific communication through scent marking and the risk of alerting prey in a wild population of a stalking predator, the Eurasian lynx. We followed lynx tracks in the snow and recorded scent marks and evidence of hunting behaviour along these tracks. Lynx preferred conspicuous objects for marking and increased scent marking rate when walking along linear structures, such as forest roads. This association was strongest when lynx were hunting, while there was only a weak correlation when no evidence of hunting could be detected. On tracks with evidence of hunting behaviour, lynx engaged less in scent marking. The relationship was most evident during the mating season, when lynx increased scent marking rates while they were not hunting. We further expected lynx to mark most in areas where they had recently hunted successfully, but time and distance to the last kill were not associated with scent marking rate. Our study supports the hypothesis that lynx face a trade-off between enhancing the detection probability of scent marks by conspecifics and avoiding eavesdropping by prey, and indicates that scent marking rate is influenced by several factors.

AB Plant selection in leaf-cutting ants is not solely based on innate or learned preferences by foragers, but also on their previous experience with plants that have harmful effects on their symbiotic fungus. Foragers learn to avoid plants harmful for the fungus, albeit harmless for themselves. Since harvested leaves are processed inside the nest, it is an open question whether gardeners and midden workers also participate in the process of plant selection, for instance by learning to reject leaves that proved to be unsuitable for the fungus. Besides occasional observations of fresh leaf fragments in the waste dump, nothing is known about how unsuitable plants already harvested are handled inside the nest. To investigate plant avoidance by gardeners and midden workers, we quantified the dynamics of leaf processing and disposal in laboratory subcolonies of Acromyrmex ambiguus during and after having offered them fungicide-treated leaves over 3 days. Control subcolonies received water-treated leaves. Both foraging and processing of fungicide-treated leaves dramatically decreased after 24 h, indicating that learned responses were involved. By this time, midden workers handled leaf fragments as waste and transported them to the waste chamber. On day 4, we asked whether foragers, gardeners and midden workers had learned to avoid plants in a species-specific way, by offering them a choice between untreated leaves of the previously treated plant and untreated leaves of an alternative plant at their worksites. They all rejected the plant previously experienced as harmful for the fungus, indicating that delayed avoidance inside the nest represents an additional step of quality control to preserve the garden from noxious plants that may have qualified as suitable for foragers. We discuss how plant material that is discarded as waste may provide a source of information about plant suitability inside the colony. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Disadvantageous inequity aversion (IA) is a behavioural response to an inequitable outcome distribution yielding a smaller reward to oneself than to a conspecific, given comparable efforts to obtain the reward. This behavioural response aims to minimize unfair reward distributions. It has been proposed to be essential for the emergence of cooperation. Humans show choice patterns compatible with IA and, as recently suggested, cooperative nonhuman species such as primates, corvids and dogs also respond negatively to disadvantageous inequitable outcomes. Here, we asked whether rats are sensitive to such inequitable outcomes. In a double T-maze apparatus, actor rats could choose to enter one of two different compartments after which a conspecific (partner rat) entered the adjoining partner compartment. One side of the paired compartments was associated with an equitable reward distribution (identical amount for the actor and the partner) whereas entry into the other paired compartment led to an inequitable reward distribution (in which the partner received a larger reward). Both compartments yielded an identical reward for the actor. Using a within-subjects design, we compared the actor rats' choices in the social condition with a nonsocial baseline control condition in which a toy rat replaced the partner rat. Actor rats exhibited disadvantageous IA: they preferred equitable outcomes in the social, but not the toy condition. Moreover, there was large variability in IA between rats. This heterogeneity in social preference could be partly explained by a social-hierarchy-dependent sensitivity to IA, as dominant animals showed higher IA than subordinate animals. Our study provides evidence for social-hierarchy-dependent disadvantageous IA in social vertebrates. Our findings are consistent with the notion that a sense of fairness may have evolved long before humans emerged. IA may therefore be a basic organizational principle, shared by many social species, that shapes the intricate social dynamics of individuals interrelating in larger groups.

AB Rates of innovative foraging behaviours and success on problem-solving tasks are often used to assay differences in cognition, both within and across species. Yet the cognitive features of some problem-solving tasks can be unclear. As such, explanations that attribute cognitive mechanisms to individual variation in problem-solving performance have revealed conflicting results. We investigated individual consistency in problem-solving performances in captive-reared pheasant chicks, Phasianus colchicus, and addressed whether success depends on cognitive processes, such as trial-and-error associative learning, or whether performances may be driven solely via noncognitive motivational mechanisms, revealed through subjects' willingness to approach, engage with and persist in their interactions with an apparatus, or via physiological traits such as body condition. While subjects' participation and success were consistent within the same problems and across similar tasks, their performances were inconsistent across different types of task. Moreover, subjects' latencies to approach each test apparatus and their attempts to access the reward were not repeatable across trials. Successful individuals did not improve their performances with experience, nor were they consistent in their techniques in repeated presentations of a task. However, individuals that were highly motivated to enter the experimental chamber were more likely to participate. Successful individuals were also faster to approach each test apparatus and more persistent in their attempts to solve the tasks than unsuccessful individuals. Our findings therefore suggest that individual differences in problem-solving success can arise from inherent motivational differences alone and hence be achieved without inferring more complex cognitive processes.

AB Allonursing, the nursing of nonfilial offspring, has been reported in a number of mammalian species; however, very few studies have investigated more than three hypotheses. The aim of our study was to investigate seven hypotheses explaining allonursing in captive giraffes. During 2007-2011, we observed 24 females and 37 calves in four zoological gardens in the Czech Republic, recording 2514 suckling events. We found that 83% of the females allonursed a nonfilial calf and 86.5% of calves allosuckled from a nonmaternal female; thus giraffes represent one of the highest occurrences of allonursing among nondomesticated mammals. The nonfilial calves more often allosuckled together with the filial ones than alone and tried to adopt positions where they may be harder to recognize, providing evidence for the milk theft hypothesis. In addition, the probability that a calf successfully allosuckled at least once from any female was higher when its mother allonursed successfully at least once than when she rejected calves. However, we found no evidence for the same rate of allonursing between reciprocal dyads of females and calves. Thus, we suggest that allonursing in giraffes is caused by offspring trying to steal milk and that females may tolerate this behaviour if reciprocal, in line with recent findings about giraffe sociality.

AB Flight is intrinsically an energetically costly way of moving and birds have developed morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations to minimize these costs. Central-place foraging seabirds commute regularly between nesting and foraging areas, providing us with opportunities to investigate their behavioural response to environmental conditions that may affect flight, such as wind. Here we tested hypotheses on how wind conditions influence flight behaviour in situations devoid of the confounding effect that, for instance, active foraging behaviour can have on movement patterns. We studied the Antarctic petrel, Thalassoica antarctica, a seabird breeding far inland in Antarctica and commuting through vast ice-covered areas characterized by steady and strong winds as well as a strict absence of foraging opportunities. We combined the three-dimensional location data from 79 GPS tracks with atmospheric wind data over three consecutive breeding seasons (2011-2013) in order to assess individual flight responses to wind conditions. Antarctic petrels encountered generally unfavourable winds, particularly during return flights. Despite their capacity to adjust their speed and heading in order to maintain constant track direction (compensation) in the strongest winds, they generally drifted as wind strengthened. Strong winds induced low-altitude flight. Birds tended to otherwise fly relatively high, but at altitudes with more favourable winds than what they would have encountered if flying higher. Our results show that commuting Antarctic petrels: (1) can tolerate a certain amount of drift according to wind conditions and (2) might be more limited by their ability to assess drift, rather than compensate for it, at least during returning flights.

AB As the evolutionary responses to environmental change depend on selection acting on individual differences, disentangling within- and between-individual variation becomes imperative. In animal migration research, multiyear tracks are thus needed to estimate the individual consistency of phenotypic traits. Avian telemetry studies have recently provided the first evidence of individuality across space and time in animal migration. Here, we compare repeatability patterns of routes and timing between two migratory birds, the marsh harrier, Circus aeruginosus, and the osprey, Pandion haliaetus, as recorded by satellite tracking. We found interspecific contrasts with low repeatability in timing and duration and a high repeatability in routes for ospreys, but the reverse pattern for marsh harriers. This was mainly caused by (1) larger between-individual variation in routes for ospreys (broad-front migration) than for marsh harriers (corridor migration) and a higher degree of repeated use of the same stopover sites among ospreys, and (2) higher within-individual consistency of timing and duration among marsh harriers, while individual ospreys were more flexible. Our findings suggest that individuality in space and time is not a shared trait complex among migrants, but may show adaptive variation depending on the species' life history and ecology.

AB Desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, forage for dead arthropods in the Tunisian salt pans. Both the unpredictable food distribution and the high surface temperatures might account for the fact that the ants do not use any pheromone trails. However, Cataglyphis has been shown to still use olfactory cues for navigation. For instance, the ants locate sparsely distributed food or pinpoint their inconspicuous nest entrance by following odour plumes. In this study we found that, as well as using odours to pinpoint a target, the ants might use environmental odours as olfactory landmarks when following habitual routes. When analysing odours collected at 100 positions in the desert, we found spatially distinct gradients of a range of different environmental odorants. Furthermore we confirm that individual foragers followed forager-specific routes when leaving the nest. Therefore these ants could potentially learn such olfactory landscape features along their stable routes. We, hence, asked whether ants could learn and use olfactory cues for route guidance. We trained ants to visit a stable feeder and presented them with a sequence of four different odours along the way. Homing ants that had already passed the odour alley on their way back were displaced to a remote test field and released at the starting point of an identical alley. Control ants that experienced the alley only during the test situation focused their search on the release point. Ants that had experienced the odours during training, however, biased their nest search towards the odour alley and performed straight walking segments along the alley. Hence, we found that ants learnt the olfactory cues along their homeward route and used these cues in the absence of other navigational information. Hence, desert ants seem to be able to use odour information to follow routes. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ecologists have recently begun to recognize sleep as a behaviour that is important in animal ecology. The first steps have been taken to characterize sleep in free-living birds, but it is unclear to what extent these results can be generalized between species. To describe sleep behaviour in the wild, we videorecorded great tits, Parus major, in their roosting boxes during two consecutive winters and individuals in captivity for comparison. Here, we examined endogenous and exogenous correlates of sleep behaviour in free-living great tits and addressed the potential confounding issues of studying avian sleep in captivity. Like that in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, sleep behaviour in great tits was strongly related to season, and was affected by sex, age and the environment. Although literature suggests relationships between sleep and risk-taking behaviours, possibly arising from stable differences in physiological state, sleep behaviour appeared to be plastic in great tits, and was not predicted by between-individual variation in exploratory tendencies. Captive tits initiated sleep later than wild individuals, even under natural photoperiodic conditions, suggesting that captivity alters timing and duration of sleep in great tits. Long-term repeatability in sleep behaviour was low for all variables, except morning latency (high repeatability) and evening box entry time, evening latency and frequency of awakenings (no detectable repeatability). Variation in sleep behaviour may largely represent within-individual differences in daily sleep requirements. Our study describes how different observable components of sleep are intercorrelated by providing evidence for significant within-individual correlations between sleep behaviours, which represent the integration of plasticity between traits. Consistent with low repeatability, low between-individual correlations suggest substantial behavioural plasticity in sleep, rather than a correlational structure leading to clear sleep 'syndromes'. Our study provides quantitative evidence for the factors producing phenotypic plasticity in behavioural sleep in an ecological context. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops cf. aduncus, in Shark Bay, Western Australia exhibit the most complex alliances known outside of humans. Advances in our understanding of these alliances have occurred with expansions of our study area each decade. In the 1980s, we discovered that males cooperated in stable trios and pairs (first-order alliances) to herd individual oestrous females, and that two such alliances of four to six, sometimes related, individuals (second-order alliances) cooperated against other males in contests over females. The 1990s saw the discovery of a large 14-member second-order alliance whose members exhibited labile first-order alliance formation among nonrelatives. Partner preferences as well as a relationship between first-order alliance stability and consortship rate in this 'super-alliance' indicated differentiated relationships. The contrast between the super-alliance and the 1980s alliances suggested two alliance tactics. An expansion of the study area in the 2000s revealed a continuum of second-order alliance sizes in an open social network and no simple relationship between second-order alliance size and alliance stability, but generalized the relationship between first-order alliance stability and consortship rate within second-order alliances. Association preferences and contests involving three second-order alliances indicated the presence of third-order alliances. Second-order alliances may persist for 20 years with stability thwarted by gradual attrition, but underlying flexibility is indicated by observations of individuals joining other alliances, including old males joining young or old second-order alliances. The dolphin research has informed us on the evolution of complex social relationships and large brain evolution in mammals and the ecology of alliance formation. Variation in odontocete brain size and the large radiation of delphinids into a range of habitats holds great promise that further effort to describe their societies will be rewarded with similar advances in our understanding of these important issues.

AB Theoretically intelligence should evolve to help animals solve specific types of problems posed by the environment, but it remains unclear how environmental complexity or novelty facilitates the evolutionary enhancement of cognitive abilities, or whether domain-general intelligence can evolve in response to domain-specific selection pressures. The social complexity hypothesis, which posits that intelligence evolved to cope with the labile behaviour of conspecific group-mates, has been strongly supported by work on the sociocognitive abilities of primates and other animals. Here we review the remarkable convergence in social complexity between cercopithecine primates and spotted hyaenas, and describe our tests of predictions of the social complexity hypothesis in regard to both cognition and brain size in hyaenas. Behavioural data indicate that there has been remarkable convergence between primates and hyaenas with respect to their abilities in the domain of social cognition. Furthermore, within the family Hyaenidae, our data suggest that social complexity might have contributed to enlargement of the frontal cortex. However, social complexity failed to predict either brain volume or frontal cortex volume in a larger array of mammalian carnivores. To address the question of whether or not social complexity might be able to explain the evolution of domain-general intelligence as well as social cognition in particular, we presented simple puzzle boxes, baited with food and scaled to accommodate body size, to members of 39 carnivore species housed in zoos and found that species with larger brains relative to their body mass were more innovative and more successful at opening the boxes. However, social complexity failed to predict success in solving this problem. Overall our work suggests that, although social complexity enhances social cognition, there are no unambiguous causal links between social complexity and either brain size or performance in problem-solving tasks outside the social domain in mammalian carnivores.

AB In group-living animals, aggression can have consequences that spread beyond the initial opponents. In this study, we observed a social group of mandrills, Mandrillus sphinx, focusing on the behaviour of uninvolved bystanders, i.e. those individuals that witnessed aggression without being directly involved. In the aftermath of aggression, uninvolved bystanders directed both increased affiliation and increased aggression to other bystanders. They also showed increased scratching, a behavioural indicator of anxiety. Bystanders affiliated preferentially with the kin of the original aggressor when they were related to the victim. Contrary to predictions, affiliating with another bystander had no effect on either the probability of aggression or the rate of scratching. The increase in postconflict aggression between bystanders may be explained by social facilitation. The increase in affiliation may represent a form of indirect reconciliation.

AB Many territorial mammals invest heavily in competitive scent marks that advertise their location, identity and current social and physiological status. Here we review the behavioural and molecular components of scent marking in house mice, Mus musculus domesticus, that influence female attraction to males and discuss how pheromone-induced learning among females and differential scent investment among males both influence female attraction to specific scent owners. Although mouse urine scents contain numerous sex-specific and individual-specific components, female attraction to spend more time near urine from males depends on contact with an involatile protein pheromone, darcin. This is an atypical major urinary protein (MUP) expressed only by males. On contact, this pheromone acts as a highly potent stimulus for associative learning, such that females learn similar attraction to the individual male's airborne odour associated with darcin; they also learn attraction to spatial cues where the pheromone was encountered. This targets female attraction to both the odour and location of individual male scent mark owners. However, the concentration and quality of airborne volatiles emitted from scent marks influence approach and contact with male scents. Under competitive pressure, males invest heavily in refreshment of scent marks at a high rate and deposit a high concentration of MUPs that bind urinary volatiles and extend the duration of volatile release. Females also gain information from airborne volatiles, including the social and infection status of the owner, which can alter their attraction to contact his scent. The ability of females to learn about individual males from their scent marks means that most decisions about preferred males are likely to be made before females are ready to mate. We are just starting to understand how different information in male scents is integrated in making these decisions. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many animals, males display costly, condition-dependent ornaments to choosy females. Indicator models of sexual selection predict that females should choose mates based on natural variation in such traits. In Habronattus pyrrithrix jumping spiders, males have conspicuous, condition-dependent red faces and green legs that they display to cryptically coloured females during courtship. In a correlational study using field-collected spiders, we paired individual males with virgin females in the laboratory and found that natural variation in male coloration did not predict mating success (likelihood of copulation) or levels of female aggression. Rather, mating success was best predicted by male body condition. We then conducted an outdoor experiment under natural sunlight where we gave both virgin and mated females the choice between two simultaneously courting males, one with his facial coloration experimentally reduced and the other that received a sham treatment. Again, we found no relationship between male coloration and courtship success. Our previous studies have shown that the presence (versus absence) of red facial coloration improves courtship success, but here we found no evidence that more subtle natural variation in this trait has any effect on success. We discuss these findings in the context of complex signalling and species recognition in Habronattus. While many studies report negative results for condition-dependent quality signalling alongside positive ones, few discuss the implications of negative results. We argue that, as empirical data accumulate, we should move towards asking why some condition-dependent traits are consistently important to females while other equally condition-dependent traits are either ignored, or only matter in certain contexts.

AB Prey consumption forms a large part of prey-handling time, and knowledge of where prey is ingested can inform management of predator-prey systems. Safeguarding habitats that promote prey consumption could enhance populations of facultative or obligate carnivores of conservation concern. We investigated habitat characteristics at 124 sites where radiocollared adult grizzly bears, Ursus arctos (N = 9) consumed ungulates, and we contrasted these sites with paired random sites. We developed a priori models incorporating the potential effects of ungulate and plant food distribution as well as risks of detection by humans and other carnivores on consumption site choice, and evaluated which factors best explain grizzly bear food-caching behaviour. Ungulates were consumed in forested areas, close to edges, and where horizontal cover was high, whereby vegetation impeded visibility of the ungulate carcass. Distance to roads had no effect on the distribution of prey consumption sites, but carcasses were further from trails than expected. Models incorporating presence/absence of key non-ungulate bear foods had little weight of evidence (w(i) <= 0.01). Food-caching behaviour did not appear to be related to variation in resource availability or risk of food spoilage but was significantly influenced by prey size. Although bears chose sites that minimized detection risk, spent more time at larger carcasses and cached 75.9% of ungulates, 50% of consumption sites had other carnivore sign, which was more likely to be present at large carcasses.

AB In sexual communication, partners often form a duet, an exchange of species-and sex-specific signals, and in such systems mate recognition is likely to be reciprocal. We studied the role of vibrational signals in reproductive isolation in the genus Aphrodes (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in which mate recognition is based on highly divergent male advertisement calls and similar female replies. We first determined in playback experiments the preferences of females of four Aphrodes species to conspecific and heterospecific male advertisement calls as well as to species-specific elements in these calls. Females of all four species responded preferentially to calls of conspecific males; however, male calls composed of similar elements played only a limited role in mate recognition. In particular, females of Aphrodes aestuarina and Aphrodes bicincta showed higher responsiveness to each other's male calls than to calls of other species. In this species pair we further examined the role of female signals and duet structure in assortative mating using 'no-choice' mating experiments. The generally higher responsiveness of A. aestuarina females to male calls of A. bicincta did not translate into higher mating success in this heterospecific cross; lengthy replies of A. aestuarina females resulted in a breakdown of a complex species-specific duet structure and associated difficulties in locating the female reduced the probability of heterospecific mating. Our study shows that in mating systems based on a duet, males may contribute more than females to sexual isolation between species. Males' contribution to assortative mating may stem not only from mate recognition but also from inability to locate the source of the heterospecific female reply.

AB The capacity to assess threat, and modulate defensive behaviour accordingly, is widespread among animals. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that venomous animals possess control of venom expenditure in predatory contexts, few have examined venom metering in defensive contexts. Here, we investigated venom use in the context of threat assessment in the western widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, a synanthropic, medically relevant species found throughout western North America. In experiment 1, we subjected wild-caught adult females (N = 43) to single (low threat) and repeated (medium threat) prods with a gelatin 'finger', and repeated pinches between two gelatin fingers (high threat). Poking at low threat elicited primarily avoidance responses ('move' and 'retract'), repeated prodding at moderate threat stimulated increased silk-flicking, and pinching at high threat provoked significantly more biting. In experiment 2, we pinched spiders (N = 20) to induce bites of three successive targets (parafilm-covered tubes) from which venom could be recovered. Spiders modulated venom expenditure at two levels. First, spiders chose whether to use venom, frequently delivering dry bites (> 50% of interactions) independent of venom depletion. Second, spiders metered venom quantity, delivering 1.8-fold more venom per bite when pinched on the body versus a leg, and 2.3-fold more venom when successive target presentations were separated by a lengthy (5 min) compared to a brief (5 s) interval. These findings suggest that spiders make decisions about silk and venom use for defence. Because these weapons are metabolically costly to replace, they represent limited commodities that should be used judiciously. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Competition among males for access to reproductive opportunities is a central tenet of behavioural biology that has critical implications for studies of mating systems, sexual selection and the evolution of numerous phenotypic traits. Given the expectation that males should compete vigorously for access to females, it may at first seem paradoxical that males in some species cooperate to reproduce, often resulting in the apparent sacrifice of direct fitness by some members of these cooperative partnerships. Because this form of cooperation lies at the interface between natural, sexual and kin selection, studies of the adaptive consequences of male reproductive cooperation may yield important insights into how complex and sometimes conflicting selective pressures shape individual behaviour. Here, we define and review examples of reproductive cooperation among male animals. We take an integrative approach to reviewing the potential causes of male-ale cooperation, including potential adaptive hypotheses, ecological correlates, phylogenetic patterns and physiological mechanisms. The impact of male reproductive cooperation on sexual selection theory is also discussed. We conclude by outlining several important directions for future research, including efforts to improve understanding of the ecological and demographic contexts in which male reproductive cooperation occurs. Collectively, such analyses promise to improve our understanding of multiple fundamental concepts in evolutionary biology. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB Sexual segregation, where males and females use habitat in different ways, is widespread among animals including fish, and has important consequences for key aspects of population ecology including foraging success, predator avoidance and growth. However, currently, evidence for sexual segregation is based on observations of sexually dimorphic species or species with differing reproductive strategies. We used European minnows, Phoxinus phoxinus, to test the null hypothesis that sexual segregation does not occur in sexually monomorphic species. A large, seminatural stream channel equipped with passive integrated transponder (PIT) detectors monitored the activity of 70 fish for 98 days on ecologically relevant spatial and temporal scales. Sexual segregation was evident spatially (with males and females using different habitats within the stream), temporally (males switched patches more frequently than females at night, but not during the day) and socially (with males, but not females, demonstrating same-sex association preferences). Our results are the first to demonstrate sexual segregation in monomorphic species outside the breeding season. We discuss potential explanations for our observations and ways in which patterns of variation in activity, space use and social interactions have important implications for population dynamics.

AB Foraging activity in animals reflects a compromise between acquiring food and avoiding predation. The risk allocation hypothesis predicts that prey animals optimize this balance by concentrating their foraging activity at times of relatively low predation risk, as much as their energy status permits, but empirical evidence is scarce. We used a unique combination of automated telemetry, manual radiotelemetry and camera trapping to test whether activity at high risk times declined with food availability as predicted in a Neotropical forest rodent, the Central American agouti, Dasyprocta punctata. We found that the relative risk of predation by the main predator, the ocelot, Leopardus pardalis, estimated as the ratio of ocelot to agouti activity on camera trap photographs, was up to four orders of magnitude higher between sunset and sunrise than during the rest of the day. Kills of radiotracked agoutis by ocelots during this high-risk period far exceeded expectations given agouti activity. Both telemetric monitoring of radio-tagged agoutis and camera monitoring of burrow entrances indicated that agoutis exited their burrows later at dawn, entered their burrows earlier at dusk and had lower overall activity levels when they lived in areas with higher food abundance. Thus, agoutis avoided activity during the high-risk period more strongly when access to food was higher. Our study provides quantitative empirical evidence of prey animals concentrating their activity at times of relatively low predation risk. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Contaminant exposure is known to alter behaviour in a wide range of contexts, including animal contests. We exposed hermit crabs to sublethal concentrations of copper, a common contaminant in coastal ecosystems. When hermit crabs engage in shell fights over empty gastropod shells they adopt two distinct roles. Attackers initiate the fight and perform bouts of vigorous shell fighting, while defenders remain withdrawn into their shells until the encounter is resolved. This role asymmetry means that the two opponents make different strategic decisions during the contest and we utilized an experimental design that allowed us to assess the effect of copper exposure independently on each role. We found that exposure of attackers to copper reduced the number of fights that were initiated, leading to fewer fights in total where the defender was evicted. Of attackers that did fight, those that were exposed to copper were also less likely to evict the defender, but this effect varied with the size difference between the crabs. During the fight, copper exposure caused attackers to rap less vigorously. When defenders were exposed to copper, however, this had no effect on the defender's chance of resisting eviction. Thus, we show for the first time that exposure to a contaminant can alter the outcome of asymmetric contests via differential effects on each of the two roles.

AB Consistent individual differences in behaviour are present in most animal populations. Historically, the fitness consequences of behavioural types (e.g. bold and shy) have been investigated in one focal species at a time. Studies generally disregard variation in heterospecifics that interact with those types. However, intraspecific variation in behavioural types of multiple interactors could generate dependent effects of behavioural type x behavioural type in species interactions and might serve as a mechanism maintaining phenotypic variation in wild populations. Here we examined how behavioural types of both predators and prey jointly determine the outcome of a predatoreprey interaction using the black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, and a syntopic field cricket, Gryllus integer. We assayed the antipredator (boldness) behaviour of individual G. integer and the boldness during foraging site selection of individual L. hesperus, as estimated by the spiders' tendency to settle in safe versus high-risk foraging environments. The best-fit models predicting prey survivorship and predator foraging success indicate that the behavioural tendencies of both predator and prey, as well as the interaction between them, jointly affect the outcome of staged predatoreprey interactions. These models boasted R-2 values 3-10 times those of models that considered behavioural type variation in either predator or prey alone. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the behavioural types of multiple interactors when testing the effects of behavioural types on species interactions and individual performance. More generally, our results strongly suggest that attention should be paid to multiple interactors if we are to understand the outcomes of species interactions.

AB Nonhuman animals quantify all manner of things, and the way in which this is done is fairly well understood. However, little research has been conducted to determine how they know what is or is not relevant in the instances in which they quantify stimuli. We assessed how four chimpanzees chose between two sets of food items when the items were distributed across separate spatial arrays. Each item was covered by a container, and then was revealed in sequence so that neither whole set was visible at one time. After all containers were revealed, some were revealed again. The chimpanzees should have ignored items that were seen a second time and instead enumerated each item only once. In another test, some of the items were transposed in location and then uncovered again. Here, the chimpanzees needed to recognize that the newly shown food items were ones they already had seen. Overall, the chimpanzees were successful in selecting the truly larger array of items despite these potential distracting representations of items. Discrimination performance also reflected analogue magnitude estimation because comparisons of sets that differed by larger amounts were easier than comparisons that differed by smaller amounts. Thus, chimpanzee quantity judgments for nonvisible sets of items are inexact, but they include an aspect of control for determining when items are uniquely presented versus represented.

AB In many animals, experience modifies behaviour in a variety of ways and contexts. Here we focus on experience of social environments and phenotypic plasticity in mate preferences. We first review adaptive hypotheses about the evolution of social plasticity in mate preferences, finding support for all of them across different species. We suggest that future work should assess which patterns of variation in social environments select for which forms of plasticity in mate preferences. We then highlight that social plasticity in mate preferences creates feedback loops between the role of social environments as causes of variation in phenotypes and the role of social environments as causes of selection on phenotypes. Fully understanding the consequences of these feedbacks will involve assessing both how selection shapes the plastic response to variation in social environments and how individuals in social environments are selected to influence the mate preferences of others. This task is just beginning, but we review evidence of genetic variation in both of these aspects of social plasticity in mate preferences. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Why do some primate groups contest access to food resources primarily at territorial borders (periphery defence), whereas others are more likely to contest resources in the centre of the home range (core defence)? One possibility is that central areas contain more food resources and so are more important for core-defending groups, whereas peripheral areas are more valuable for groups that defend territorial boundaries. I tested this hypothesis by analysing the distribution of resources in home ranges and aggressive intergroup interactions for six groups of grey-cheeked mangabeys, Lophocebus albigena, and six groups of redtail monkeys, Cercopithecus ascanius, at the Ngogo site in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Neither mangabeys nor redtails exhibited core or boundary defence in this study; instead, both species appeared to defend discrete feeding sites, and neither the core nor peripheral home range areas consistently contained greater quantities of food. I also compared variables that are frequently used to characterize primate food availability (the feeding value of the interaction site versus food abundance, distribution and patch size) to determine if they are equally accurate in predicting aggressive food defence. Whereas site feeding intensity predicted aggression by redtails, aggression by mangabey males correlated with the abundance and distribution of resources. These results demonstrate the importance of testing multiple aspects of food availability, which can vary in importance among different primate populations. I conclude by proposing a new model of food and range defence in group-living primates that predicts specific relationships between various food characteristics and core, patch and periphery defence.

AB Elaborate male traits are typically used to attract mates and to compete with other males for mating opportunities. However, similarly ornate secondary sexual characteristics are also found in females in many species and may be used in competition in both sexual and nonsexual contexts. Trait elaboration in females may be particularly important in cooperatively breeding species where reproduction is monopolized by a few individuals in a group and where both sexes must compete for these limited mating opportunities. Previous work in African starlings has shown that females in cooperatively breeding species are larger and more ornamented than those in noncooperative species, resulting in reduced plumage and size dimorphism. To further examine patterns of sexual dimorphism in signalling traits and to better understand their role in mediating social competition, we investigated the form and function of song in cooperatively breeding superb starlings, Lamprotornis superbus. In addition to comparing song between sexes, we contrasted song in dominant breeders and subordinate helpers of both sexes and examined its use in various social contexts. We found that song was indistinguishable between males and females, with both sexes showing similar complexity, pitch, versatility and structure. However, the song of breeders was more versatile than that of helpers. Moreover, song structure differed when birds sang in chorus from when they sang alone. These findings suggest that, like male song, female song may be used in social competition, and that song may be an important signal in both sexes in species where intrasexual competition is high in males and females.

AB Social parasites can break into their host colonies using sensory deception, force, or both. To evaluate the role of sensory deception in eusocial obligate food robbers, we studied the Mesoamerican stingless bee Lestrimelitta niitkibehost species system, including preferred and nonpreferred host species. The use of citral as a propaganda substance is documented in L. niitkib, but possible mechanisms used by individual scouts to overcome host species recognition have not been studied. We analysed the cuticular profiles of L. niitkib and host species, coupled with bioassays of time to aggression (latency) and included data on host species raid frequency. We found that L. niitkib has a simple, but not insignificant, cuticular profile. Generally, L. niitkib cuticular profiles were similar to (but did not mimic) profiles of its preferred host species and differed from profiles of nonpreferred hosts. As expected, latency generally fitted a recognition system based on the degree of similarity between the cleptobiont's cuticular label and the host species template, with chemically similar species reacting slower and chemically distant species reacting rapidly to L. niitkib. There was a positive correlation between raid ratio and latency, indicating that the speed of detection and aggression towards L. niitkib scouts could influence host species selection. Cuticular profile similarity of individual L. niitkib scouts to host species may help L. niitkib scouts evade recognition and attacks from guards. In a further step, unnoticed L. niitkib scouts could successfully recruit nestmates to mass-raid host species colonies. The fact that L. niitkib can also plunder aggressive species, suggests that obligate cleptobiosis within its narrow biological niche could be characterized by flexibility in invasion strategies to allow exploiting a broad range of host species and be successful over evolutionary times.

AB Females choose their mate on the basis of secondary sexual characters such as physical ornaments, courtship behaviours or vocalizations. In male birds, vocalizations are known to increase their attractiveness and consequently their probability of copulation. Moreover, male songs have been shown to shape maternal investment, particularly with regard to egg quality. Artificial manipulation of male attractiveness has been found to affect female sexual preferences and maternal investment. In this regard, supranormal stimuli are thought to increase such responses. The present study was designed to assess whether supranormal acoustic stimuli, known to induce high levels of sexual responsiveness in female canaries, Serinus canaria, could increase maternal investment beyond levels observed in birds exposed to natural songs. Exposure to supranormal songs (G phrases) increased maternal investment: compared to females exposed to moderately attractive (Control) or naturally attractive (A) phrases. Females exposed to supranormal songs laid bigger eggs (egg volume and mass, albumen mass); moreover, females in the G group laid eggs with heavier yolks than females in the Control group. In contrast, no differences were found between groups with regard to testosterone deposition in the eggs. Thus, the adjustment of females' investment in their brood seems to take various forms that appear to be related to different features of males' sexually selected traits, which raises the questions of how and why these different mechanisms have been selected.

AB Advanced inferring abilities that are used for predator recognition and avoidance have been documented in a variety of animal species that produce alarm calls. In contrast, evidence for cognitive abilities that underpin predation avoidance in nonalarm-calling species is restricted to associative learning of heterospecific alarm calls and predator presence. We investigated cognitive capacities that underlie the perception and computation of external information beyond associative learning by addressing contextual information processing in pigeons, Columba livia, a bird species without specific alarm calls. We used a habituation/dishabituation paradigm across sensory modes to test pigeons' context-dependent inferring abilities. The birds reliably took previous knowledge about predator presence into account and responded with predator-specific scanning behaviour only if predator presence was not indicated before or if the perceived level of urgency increased. Hence, pigeons' antipredator behaviour was not based on the physical properties of displayed stimuli or their referential content alone but on contextual information, indicated by the kind and order of stimulus presentation and different sensory modes.

AB A profusion of theoretical and empirical studies has successfully explored the issue of adaptive management of body mass by small birds threatened with both starvation and predation. In addition to diurnal body mass cycles, body mass tends to increase with either poorer mean conditions or more variable conditions, such as those often experienced during winter. In many species, individual dominance status will affect access to food and predation risk, and is therefore predicted to influence patterns of optimal body mass further. We investigated body mass regulation via repeated measurements without capture in groups of Siberian jays, Perisoreus infaustus, during autumn. As predicted, body mass of individuals increased throughout the day and towards the winter and was higher during colder periods. Jay body mass was also correlated with wind chill conditions 23 h before. This makes sense since conditions 24 h earlier were a better predictor of current conditions than conditions either 12 or 48 h earlier. Dominant birds (i.e. breeders) that were large carried relatively lower fat reserves than large subordinate individuals. The opposite was true for morphologically small birds. Together this suggests tighter requirements for individual variation in mass for dominant breeders in these groups. Our findings in this food-hoarding corvid are in general agreement with models and results concerning much smaller birds. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB How food abundance affects (1) whether or not individuals defend territories and (2) what size of territory is defended are crucial to understanding the role that territoriality plays in regulating the population size of stream-dwelling salmonids. The threshold model of feeding territoriality predicts that territorial defence will be most intense at intermediate levels of food abundance, whereas optimal territory-size models predict that territory size will decrease with increasing food abundance. While the latter prediction has been supported by several studies of stream salmonids, too few levels of food abundance were typically used to describe the exact relationship between territory size and food abundance. Hence, to quantify the relation between the intensity of defence, territory size and food abundance, we manipulated food abundance over a broad range of values (0.62, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20% of the fish wet body weight in dry food per day) in artificial stream channels (1.92 x 0.77 m), while monitoring the territorial behaviour of juvenile rainbow trout. As predicted by the threshold model of feeding territoriality, the frequency of territorial aggression was highest at intermediate levels of food abundance, but fish never ceased defending territories entirely, particularly at food densities likely found in the wild. Also as predicted, the aggressive radius of rainbow trout decreased significantly, but only by 30% over a 32-fold increase in food abundance, equivalent to a 51% decrease in territory size. Our results suggest that territory size is relatively insensitive to changes in food abundance and may have a regulatory effect on population density.

AB Purpose-built nests for rearing offspring have important fitness consequences. Nests not only provide a protective environment for developing young but also in some species can serve as important signalling devices that reveal crucial information about the quality of the builder. Nesting behaviour and nest structure are often adjusted to suit local environmental conditions. An important question is what happens when conditions are altered as a result of anthropogenic activities. Human-induced eutrophication is an insidious, global problem. Here, we investigated experimentally the impact of algal blooms on nest construction in a fish: the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. We found that males took longer to complete their nests under algal conditions. Completed nests were also smaller and possessed wider nest entrances. Together, our results suggest that human-induced algal blooms can have profound effects on nesting behaviour and nest construction, with implications for both offspring survival and the utility of nests as extended phenotypic signals.

AB Discriminating between different individuals is considered as prerequisite for any forms of social knowledge. In birds, discriminating between conspecifics based on individual characteristics has been tested mainly in the auditory domain with territorial calls and songs for neighbour and kin discrimination but little is known about discriminating between signallers in food calls. Ravens utilize a large set of calls and show individually distinctive call repertoires. Moreover, they show advanced social tactics during foraging, suggesting that they are capable of dealing with conspecifics on an individual basis. When confronted with food that is difficult to access, ravens produce particular calls ('haa', yells); these calls attract other ravens and, thus, have been hypothesized to serve as 'functionally referential signals'. We here examined whether ravens are able to differentiate between individuals on the basis of these food calls. We first analysed individual differences in call parameters, using 424 food calls recorded from 18 individually marked wild ravens in the Austrian Alps. We then tested 18 captive ravens for recognition of individual differences in food calls with playbacks, using a habituation-dishabituation design. We found evidence that food calls show individual call characteristics in fundamental frequency and intensity-related measurements providing ravens with the opportunity to respond according to these individually distinct features. Furthermore, ravens discriminated between unfamiliar ravens in the habituation-dishabituation experiment, indicating that they may discern individual differences. Our results suggest that raven food calls are individually distinct and that the birds may be capable of differentiating between food-calling individuals.

AB Boldness in animal personality studies is measured using a range of different behavioural assays, including responses to novel objects, novel environments and threatening stimuli. These assays should be correlated if they all reflect boldness, but this assumption has rarely been tested. We investigated experimentally whether presentation of threatening stimuli (a taxidermic puff adder, Bitis arietans arietans) and novel object (an unfamiliar food item) both assayed the same personality trait in wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus. We recorded individual responses to both the snake model and novel foods for 57 baboons encompassing all age-sex classes in two study troops over 3 years. Surprisingly, those individuals that showed the greatest alarm responses to the model snake, that is, the least bold responses, also inspected it for longer. Furthermore, individuals' threat responses did not correlate with their response to the novel food. Thus, boldness according to one definition was not related to boldness using another definition. We suggest that threat-directed behaviours did not reflect individual boldness, but instead were indicative of another personality dimension: anxiety. These findings highlight that current boldness assays may not be interchangeable, and in some cases may not measure boldness at all. We stress the value of using multiple assays to measure the personality trait of interest. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pheromones elicit a species-wide, class-specific and stereotyped reaction. By learning class- or individual-specific cues in association with pheromones and subsequently using the cues alone for discrimination, a receiver may react more effectively to its social environment than if its only reaction to pheromones was stereotyped. In the rove beetle Aleochara curtula, recently mated females are inappropriate mating partners; nevertheless they elicit male sexual reactions owing to olfactory excitation by the female sex pheromone. During physical contact, mated females can be discerned by gustatory perception of an antiaphrodisiac pheromone via the clasper-like parameres of the male genitalia. Males transfer the antiaphrodisiac pheromone during copulation, together with the spermatophore, onto their mate. Our experiments showed that in association with antiaphrodisiac pheromone perception, males learned the scent of a mated female and relied on this chemical signature to refrain from sexual grasping responses in subsequent encounters. Habituation-dishabituation experiments further showed that the learned patterns were individual specific. The application of cuticular extracts to alter the scent of females, and the resulting inability of males to discriminate between similar-smelling females, demonstrated that males relied on cuticular hydrocarbons for individual discrimination. Chemical analysis of the cuticular profiles revealed higher variation in female than in male patterns. Learning the scent of mated females in association with the antiaphrodisiac pheromone allows males to reduce the time and energy spent on sexual reactions towards inappropriate mating partners and hence gives them more time to search for a receptive female at the mating site.

AB Mate choice is one of the main mechanisms of sexual selection, with profound implications for individual fitness. Changes in environmental conditions can cause individuals to alter their mate search behaviour, with consequences for mate choice. Human-induced eutrophication of water bodies is a global problem that alters habitat structure and visibility in aquatic ecosystems. We investigated whether changes in habitat complexity and male cue modality, visual or olfactory, influence mate search behaviour of female three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. We allowed gravid females to search for mates in experimental pools that contained two nesting males and one social female, under low and high structural complexity (created from green Plexiglas sheets), with access to either visual or olfactory cues of the individuals. We found increased habitat complexity reduced the number of visits to nesting males, while a switch from visual to olfactory cues reduced the time spent searching for males, the number of visits to nesting males, the time spent evaluating males, and the relative time spent associating with males rather than females. Thus, females decreased mate searching and mate evaluation in the absence of visual stimulation. This reduced the rate of mate encounters and probably also the opportunity for choice. Our results show that changes in habitat structure and visibility can alter female mate searching, with potential consequences for the opportunity for sexual selection.

AB Predator-prey interactions play a substantial role in shaping spatial distributions of organisms in biological communities. Recent theory has considered optimal habitat selection strategies for predators and prey that interact in real time. One consistent prediction across many theoretical studies is that it could be adaptive for predators to assess and respond to the quality of resources consumed by their prey (resources the predators do not consume). However, extremely few empirical studies have tested this prediction. We utilized a tritrophic system in which seven-spotted lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L., Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), Hemiptera: Aphididae) and tic bean plants (Vicia faba L., Fabaceae) were, respectively, the predators, prey and prey's resource. In microcosms, we created patches of varying quality (from the perspective of the prey) among which predators and prey were allowed to move freely. By utilizing treatments in which there were (1) prey but no predators, (2) predators but no prey and (3) predators and prey simultaneously, we determined which sources of information influenced movement and habitat selection. Predators were able to detect and respond to the quality per se of their prey's resource, and they preferred the highest-quality patch regardless of the presence of prey. While theory has frequently predicted such behaviour, direct responses of predators to resource quality (rather than resource amounts, resource damage, or indirect cues of prey) have not previously been demonstrated. These results substantiate general predictions of ecological theory and have implications for predicting the behaviour of biological control agents.

AB Colonial living imposes strong selection pressures on the communication systems of species with many animals communicating on the same sensory channels simultaneously. Colonial species often exhibit complex individual vocal signatures that encode a caller's identity in their vocalizations. During lactation, Australian sea lion, Neophoca cinerea, mothers and pups are repeatedly separated when mothers leave the colony to forage. After maternal foraging trips, mothers and pups must reunite in the colony. Both mothers and pups produce individually distinctive vocalizations during reunions and can recognize their counterpart's calls. Using playback experiments with modified calls, we investigated the acoustic parameters involved in the recognition of pup vocalizations by mothers. We also examined the efficiency of the vocal signature in three habitat types within the colony using propagation tests. We found that Australian sea lion females used a combination of temporal, amplitude and frequency parameters to recognize their pup's vocalizations. Pup vocalizations were severely degraded in the herbaceous dune habitat type with no vocal signature components reliably propagating to any measured distance. By contrast, calls propagated comparatively well in the shrubby dune habitat of the colony, as the vegetation appeared to act as a windshield. This study shows that the vocal signatures of Australian sea lion pups are both shaped and constrained by their environment and ecology, and that these signatures are of a moderate level of complexity when compared to those of other colonial vertebrates.

AB In the field, plants are attacked by several herbivore species both simultaneously and in isolation. Spatial variation in damage to plants by different herbivores may affect the search behaviour of parasitoid wasps, but the consequences of this variation for host-parasitoid interactions are still little understood. We examined the effects of multiple herbivory on the search behaviour of the parasitoid Cotesia glomerata. Reduced parasitism was found in a field tent experiment, when both the host small cabbage white, Pieris rapae, and the nonhost cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae, were present on Brassica oleracea plants. When hosts and nonhosts occurred on the same or neighbouring plants, this reduction in parasitism was similar, but the underlying behavioural mechanisms were different. In wind tunnel bioassays, parasitoids were equally attracted towards plants infested by the two herbivore species but were more attracted to plants with both herbivore species than to plants with only one. Differences in arrival tendencies therefore could not explain the reduced parasitism in the tent experiment with mixed infestations. Experiments showed that parasitoids readily left nonhost patches, whereas leaving tendencies from mixed patches of hosts and nonhosts were the same as from pure host patches. Therefore, reduced leaving tendencies and reduced host encounters explained the lower parasitism rate in mixed infestations in the tent experiment. Our results show that the spatial context in which hosts and nonhosts attack plants determines the foraging efficiency of parasitoids, with consequences for host-parasitoid interactions.

AB Alarm calls and food-associated calls from a diverse range of species are said to be functionally referential, in that receivers can use these sounds to predict environmental events in the absence of other contextual cues. The evolutionary driver for referential alarm calls has been hypothesized to be the mutually incompatible escape behaviours required to avoid different predators. However, some species produce acoustically distinctive and referential alarm calls but do not show highly referential abilities in other domains. We examined whether food-associated calls in many species are likely to be functionally referential and whether they specifically communicate about characteristic features of food. Food-associated calls are given in both feeding and nonfeeding contexts, and the types of information contained vary greatly. Most species do not produce unique calls for different foods; more common is variation in the call rate, which suggests that call structure reflects the callers' internal state rather than the food type. We also examined the ultimate function of food-associated calls to evaluate whether there is a unifying explanation for the evolution of functionally referential food calls. Based on the literature, there does not appear to be a unifying function. In conclusion, while functionally referential food-associated calls have been convincingly demonstrated in a few species, it is more common for these vocalizations to reflect arousal rather than additionally providing specific referential information about the feeding event. At this point, there is no compelling hypothesis to explain the evolution of functionally referential food-associated calls. Given the multiple functions of food-associated signals, we should not expect a unitary explanation. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The colour vision polymorphism of most New World primates is a model system to study the function of colour vision. Theories for the evolution of primate trichromacy focus on the efficient detection and selection of ripe fruits and young leaves among mature leaves, when trichromats are likely to be better than dichromats. We examined whether colour vision status affected insect capture in groups of tamarins (Saguinus spp.) in captivity and in the field. Trichromatic tamarins caught more prey than dichromats, but dichromats caught a greater proportion of camouflaged prey than trichromats. The prey caught did not differ in size between the two visual phenotypes. Thus two factors may contribute to the maintenance of the genetic polymorphism of middle- to long-wavelength photopigments in platyrrhines: the advantage in finding fruit and leaves, which supports the maintenance of the polymorphism through a heterozygote advantage, and the dichromats' exploitation of different (e.g. camouflaged) food, which results in frequency-dependent selection on the different colour vision phenotypes.

AB In nonhuman species, increasing the proportion of potential mates in the local population often increases preferences for high-quality mates, while increasing the proportion of potential competitors for mates intensifies within-sex competition. In two experiments, we tested for analogous effects in humans by manipulating pictorial cues to the sex ratio of the local population and assessing women's preferences for facial symmetry, a putative cue of mate quality in humans. In both experiments, viewing slideshows with varied sex ratios tended to increase preferences for symmetry in the sex that was depicted as being in the majority and tended to decrease preferences for symmetry in the sex that was depicted as being in the minority. In other words, increasing the apparent proportion of a given sex in the local population increased the salience of facial cues of quality in that sex, which may support adaptive appraisals of both potential mates' and competitors' quality. This effect of sex ratio was independent of (i.e. did not interact with) an effect of cues to the degree of variation in the attractiveness of individuals in the local population, whereby the degree of variation in men's, but not women's, attractiveness modulated symmetry preferences. These findings demonstrate that symmetry preferences in humans are influenced by cues to the sex ratio of the local population in ways that complement both the facultative responses that have been observed in many other species and theories of both intersexual and intrasexual selection.

AB Boldness and aggressiveness are two behavioural traits that have received extensive attention in the field of animal behaviour. However, relatively little is known about how these traits are maintained in populations and the fitness of individuals that exhibit them. We tested the effect of boldness and aggressiveness on the reproductive success of zebrafish, Danio rerio. Using behavioural tests, we established groups of males that varied consistently in their boldness (bold, middling and shy) as well as groups of males that differed in their aggressiveness (aggressive, middling and nonaggressive) and paired them with randomly selected females. We found no difference in the total number of eggs laid by females mated to bold or aggressive males. However, the number of fertilized eggs differed, with the boldest and the most aggressive males fertilizing more eggs than the other groups. Furthermore, the proportion of fertilized eggs differed between groups. These results show that an individual's reproductive fitness can be associated with behavioural variations in boldness and aggressiveness. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In a subsocial stinkbug Parastrachia japonensis, mature adult females lay both fertile eggs and trophic eggs in an underground nest, guard the egg mass for 15-20 days, and collect and provide food fruits for the nymphs. We investigated the vertical transmission of this species' obligate gut symbiont 'Candidatus Benitsuchiphilus tojoi' from mother to offspring. We observed that the mothers started to excrete a copious amount of symbiont-containing white mucus from the anus onto the egg mass at around 45 min before egg hatching; the excretion continued for approximately 40 min, and about 5 min later, fertile eggs in the egg mass started to hatch synchronously. The newborn nymphs immediately ingested the mucous secretion and the trophic eggs, which were completely consumed within 24 h. Mother removal and anal-sealing experiments confirmed that vertical symbiont transmission was mediated by the nymphs' exploitation of the mother-derived mucous secretion. Mother removal also resulted in asynchronous egg hatching, suggesting maternal involvement in the egg-hatching synchrony. These results indicate that vertical symbiont transmission in P. japonensis is finely tuned to the timing of egg hatching through intricate mother-offspring behavioural interactions, and highlight how sociality can evolutionarily affect symbiosis and vice versa.

AB Males often signal to attract mates and can show extensive variation in how much time they spend signalling. In crickets, some males signal extensively, spending over 50% of their adult lives attempting to attract a mate. At the other end of the continuum, some males are rarely observed to signal. Given that signalling efforts are usually correlated with mating success, all individuals should be selected to signal with high effort. Why then, do males show such variability? Signalling effort variation may stem from differences in physiological capacity that result from disparities in energy stores, metabolic capacities of the muscles used for sexual signalling, the comparative size of the signalling organs, or overall differences in body size. To address the proximate causes underlying variation in signalling effort, we quantified the morphological, physiological and biochemical variation among male European house crickets, Acheta domesticus, and assessed whether it correlated with signalling effort variation. Surprisingly, we found no correlation between signalling effort and activity of the beta-oxidation enzyme HOAD, suggesting that the capacity for lipid metabolism is not associated with signalling effort. Instead, signalling effort variation was associated with differences in overall body size and differences in the activity of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase. Together our findings suggest that the ability to locate and assimilate high-quality diets both during development (to grow large) and into adulthood (capacity for carbohydrate catabolism) may explain some of the variation in signalling effort in this species.

AB The rate of evolution of mating preferences and mate signalling traits can influence local adaptation and diversification under environmental change. However, the rate of evolution of female preferences has not been directly examined in natural populations. An opportunity to do so arose through the introduction of high-predation Trinidadian guppies, Poecilia reticulata, from the Yarra River into high-and low-predation environments in the Damier River. Nine years (13-26 guppy generations) after the introduction, we tested whether female preferences for key aspects of male colour differed between the rivers and between introduced high-and low-predation populations. Based on two independent laboratory experiments, we conclude that little divergence in female preferences has apparently occurred between any of the populations, or between predation regimes. In combination with previous work, these results suggest that the evolution of guppy colour and female preferences are influenced by factors in addition to just predation, and that female preferences may generally take longer to evolve than other types of traits, particularly in populations that experience weak or fluctuating sexual selection gradients.

AB We examined the spatial perception of predator targeting by prey during simulated hawk attacks on house finch, Carpodacus mexicanus, flocks, with an overall goal of gaining insight into the targeting process itself. Predator targeting of specific prey during attacks determines how danger is distributed among group members, and thereby determines key aspects of the safety of feeding in groups, such as risk dilution and its relationship to antipredator vigilance. During the main experiment, a model hawk suddenly appeared at either 3 m or 9 m from finches feeding near protective cover. The 9 m attacks always caused nearly all birds to flee to cover. During 3 m attacks, only birds directly in the line of attack fled to cover; the other birds instead consistently flew nearly perpendicular to the attack and away from cover. These results suggest that most finches did not perceive themselves to be targeted for attack when the hawk appeared at close range; otherwise, all birds appeared to perceive themselves as potential targets. A second experiment demonstrated that information about predator targeting is derived from observation of the predator itself rather than the behaviour of flockmates in the direct line of attack. A third experiment demonstrated that distance to cover also influenced the birds' response to targeting; thus, reactions to apparent nontargeting were not simply a matter of moving away from the line of attack. The differential perception of targeting during an attack is probably a widespread phenomenon in social birds and other animals. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Aggressive behaviour associated with the defence of a territory is thought to impose substantial energy costs and thus to represent a trade-off with other energy-demanding activities. The energy costs of aggressive behaviours, however, have rarely been estimated in the wild, and the overall contribution of territorial defence to daily energy expenditure has never been determined. We studied the activity budget of breeding king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, equipped with heart rate data loggers to estimate the energy costs associated with territory defence in this colonial bird exhibiting very high rates of agonistic interactions. We also assessed whether threat displays imposed lower energy costs than attacks with body contact. During territorial defence (i.e. threats and physical attacks combined), energy expenditure averaged 1.27 times resting metabolic rate. Defence accounted for 13% of the daily time budget and contributed to 2.7% of the total daily energy expenditure. Interactions with body contact cost three times more than threat displays, but accounted for only 16% of the aggressive behaviours recorded. Neither did body mass, body size, penguin sex or breeding stage affect the cost of aggressiveness. Our results are consistent with previous research reporting that fighting imposes significant metabolic costs. However, we found that aggressive behaviour in king penguins was not an expensive activity compared to the total energy budget. Because king penguins go without food and are sleep deprived while breeding, they may have developed behavioural strategies (e.g. lower rates of attacks with body contact) allowing them to defend their territory efficiently at a low energy cost.

AB Lacking experience represents a constraint on solitary breeding, which may be overcome by joining groups of more experienced breeders. Also, biological market theory predicts preference for partnerships with conspecifics of the highest value. We examined the formation of cooperative brood-rearing coalitions in facultatively social eider females, Somateria mollissima. Our aim was to elucidate the hitherto neglected role of age on female group size and condition differences within groups, and to explore whether older females represent attractive coalition partners. Based on previous work, we hypothesized that older breeders are found in smaller groups, and that the attraction of older partners would override the predicted negative effect of differences in body condition on female group size. We found that older females occurred in smaller groups and that the negative relationship between condition differences and group size became less steep with increasing age of the oldest group member. We also found that the maximum body condition found in a brood-rearing coalition increased with the age of the oldest female, despite a sharp decline in the probability of the oldest individual being the one in best condition. These results demonstrate the importance of age in the formation of cooperative brood-rearing coalitions and the increase in female quality with age. The experience of older females is a valuable commodity, which attracts younger prospective coalition partners in good condition regardless of body condition differences. Our results illustrate the general principle that grouping decisions cannot be understood by viewing partner choice criteria in isolation. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Effects of social learning on mate preferences have been observed in a wide range of animal species, including humans. However, it is not known whether social learning also influences other important aspects of social perception in humans. We investigated whether 'eavesdropping', a form of social learning whereby observers extract information about individuals' qualities by observing their interactions with others, influences men's perceptions of the dominance of potential rivals. We found that observing the responses of other individuals modulates the perceived dominance of aggressors. Observers rated aggressors' dominance higher when they had previously observed others responding to the aggressor in a fearful, intimidated manner than when they had observed others responding to the aggressor in an angry, aggressive manner. By contrast with this finding for rated dominance, observing identical interactions did not affect observers' perceptions of the trustworthiness of the aggressors. The effect of observing others' responses on the perceived dominance of aggressors demonstrates that eavesdropping influences perceptions of dominance rank among men, which would be adaptive if it reduces the costs (e. g. risk of serious injury and/or loss of resources) that may be associated with acquiring knowledge of others' dominance rank via exclusively self-reliant learning. While previous research on social learning and sexual selection has focused on intersexual interactions (i.e. mate choice copying effects), our findings suggest that eavesdropping may also influence sexual selection for male traits via intrasexual competition.

AB Cooperative breeding has evolved primarily in species in which individuals are organized into family groups, and kin selection is considered to be a major force in the evolution of helping behaviour. Family groups are generally thought to form through delayed or limited dispersal, but dispersal patterns vary considerably both between species and in different populations of the same species, and the relationship between dispersal, kinship and cooperation is poorly understood. In this study, we combined long-term observational and genetic data to compare the patterns of demography, kinship and helping in two populations of long-tailed tits, Aegithalos caudatus, a species that exhibits kin-biased helping by failed breeders but not delayed dispersal. Both populations had the same annual breeding success, but philopatric recruitment rates were significantly higher in one population, especially for females. This led to a correspondingly higher proportion of individuals having at least one close relative in that population. Surprisingly, however, there was no difference in the pattern of helping behaviour between the two populations in terms of helper prevalence, helper sex or the relatedness between helpers and the breeders they assisted. We discuss possible explanations and highlight the limitations of population-level analyses for understanding the relationship between demography and cooperation.

ID SEQUENTIAL CHOICE; DEPRIVATION; DECISIONS
AB In the present paper, we explore a novel preparation for the study of animal choice behaviour designed to capture some aspects of naturally occurring patch exploitation. Although one can cast the problem of patch exploitation as a binary choice, naturally occurring patch-leaving decisions are inevitably asymmetric. We asked whether captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, treat leaving and staying in the same way. To do this we factorially varied the delays associated with leaving and staying in a food patch. In addition, we manipulated our subject's level of motivation (e. g. hunger) using prefeeding treatments. We found that hungry subjects came closest to our prediction of treating leaving and staying in the same way, but that less motivated subjects showed a pronounced and surprising bias in favour of leaving. We discuss the implications of results for experimental and theoretical studies and choice behaviour. We suggest that students of choice behaviour need to understand the sources of such biases because naturally occurring choice situations are seldom perfectly symmetrical.

AB We used experimental food patches to test how habitat factors affect predation risk for Sykes' monkeys. We created food patches to reveal monkeys' foraging cost of predation. We measured the monkeys' variation in predation costs with patches stratified by height and arrayed horizontally. We expected the monkeys to harvest the most from patches with the least substrate/most food, and to harvest the least from patches with the most substrate/least food. Furthermore, we predicted that giving-up densities (GUDs) would (1) decrease with greater height (2) increase on the ground when sightlines were blocked, and (3) in a landscape grid, decrease in patches near trees and increase in patches near shrubs. Monkeys harvested the most from the richest patches and the least from the poorest patches. Along a vertical axis, GUDs decreased by 15% from 0.1 m to 2 m, and by 10% from 2 m to 5 m. Along a horizontal axis, GUDs were affected by curtain-blocked sightlines (4.7% higher with curtains), but not by distances to vegetation. We demonstrated that the vertical landscape gradient is more meaningful to Sykes' monkeys than the terrestrial horizontal. We conclude that experiments with giving-up densities in depletable food patches provide effective means for studying primate ecology. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Understanding the evolution of cooperation requires determining the costs and benefits of cooperative behaviour. In cooperative breeders, where nonbreeding individuals assist in raising offspring, these 'helpers' are expected to increase the fitness of breeders and hence empirical research has focused on the effect they have on reproductive output and breeder survival. However, the effects of helpers during the postfledging period are poorly known because of the difficulty of tracking fledglings in the wild. Helper presence might be beneficial for fledglings, for example through continuous food delivery or increased predator vigilance, but potential competition between helpers and fledglings, or changes in investment of parents assisted by helpers, could counteract these positive effects and have a negative influence on postfledging survival probabilities or promote dispersal. We investigated the survival of juvenile sociable weavers, Philetairus socius, raised in pairs alone versus pairs with helpers by using capture-mark-recapture methods to control for individual detectability in survival estimation. We found that local survival in the first year was reduced in young raised by groups versus those raised by pairs. This may reflect either higher mortality or emigration of juveniles raised in groups. Hence, our study reveals significant postfledging effects of cooperative breeding that have not been reported previously and that need to be investigated in studies addressing the evolution of cooperative breeding.

AB Sexual selection has resulted in the elaboration of secondary sexual characteristics in many animals. Although mammalian scent glands, secretions and marking behaviour are commonly sexually dimorphic, these traits have received little attention compared to avian plumage and mammalian weaponry. Overmarking, when one individual places a scent mark directly over that of another individual, is of particular interest. Owing to the costs of repeatedly monitoring and covering the scent marks of rivals, overmarking may provide an honest indication of a male's resource-holding potential, perhaps explaining why female rodents exposed to experimental overmarks subsequently prefer to associate with males whose scent mark was on top. This study on wild banded mongooses, Mungos mungo, suggests that overmarking may primarily affect behavioural mating success through male competition not by female mate choice. First, chemical analyses of anal gland secretions demonstrated that males had individually distinctive scents, and a field experiment confirmed that mongooses were able to discriminate between scents from different individuals. Observations of overmarking patterns showed a relationship between overmarking score and behavioural mating success, but we found no evidence that females actively chose to mate with males with high overmarking scores. Instead, we found that males with higher overmarking scores first mate-guarded females at a significantly younger age than males with lower overmarking scores. Since mate-guarding males obtain the vast majority of matings, this suggests that overmarking may be an important component of intrasexual competition for mating opportunities in this species.

AB Tagging animals is frequently employed in ecological studies to monitor individual behaviour, for example postrelease survival and dispersal of captive-bred animals used in conservation programmes. While the majority of studies focus on the efficacy of tags in facilitating the relocation and identification of individuals, few assess the direct effects of tagging in biasing animal behaviour. We used an experimental approach with a control to differentiate the effects of handling and tagging captive-bred juvenile freshwater pearl mussels, Margaritifera margaritifera, prior to release into the wild. Marking individuals with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags significantly decreased their burrowing rate and, therefore, increased the time taken to burrow into the substrate. This effect was contributed to, in part, by the detrimental impacts of handling, which also significantly affected activity, burrowing ability and the time taken for each individual to emerge and start probing the substrate. Disturbance during handling and tagging may lead to indirect mortality after release by increasing the risk of predation or dislodgement during flooding, thereby potentially compromising any conservation strategy contingent on population supplementation or reintroduction. This is the first study to demonstrate that handling and PIT tagging has a detrimental impact on invertebrate behaviour. Moreover, our results provide useful information that will inform freshwater bivalve conservation strategies. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sympatry of multiple, interbreeding colour morphs within a single population requires equilibrium between the various agents of selection acting on alternative colour morphs. This colour polymorphism is an area of growing interest in evolutionary biology as it contradicts many assumptions of natural and sexual selection. Owing to the strong role of colour in intraspecific communication, sexual selection is a primary candidate for balancing selection and its potential is supported by a growing body of both empirical and theoretical evidence. We examined patterns of mate choice in the ornate rainbowfish, Rhadinocentrus ornatus, a small freshwater fish species from the wallum habitat of east coast Australia, to see whether nonrandom mating contributes to colour polymorphism maintenance in this system. Populations from Fraser Island and the adjacent mainland comprise a common blue morph and a rare red morph. These colour morphs are present in both males and females, with red individuals accounting for approximately 18% of the individuals in our focal population from Fraser Island. In dichotomous laboratory mate choice experiments, we found that female R. ornatus preferred males of the opposite colour morph to themselves, a mating pattern known as negative assortative mating, which may provide indirect benefits to females through the generation of outbred offspring. In contrast, males preferred red females irrespective of their own colour morph, suggesting females may possess red morph-specific traits that are the target of sexual selection by males. Our findings support an emerging pattern that suggests that multiple selection pressures may interact to maintain alternative colour morphs.

AB Contestants in agonistic encounters may use assessments of self, opponent and resource quality as a basis for making behavioural decisions. Ritualized displays reduce risk and energy expenditure during assessments, but may lead to injurious fighting behaviour under certain circumstances. In this study, we examined the decision-making process of male sierra dome spiders (Neriene (=Linyphia) litigiosa: Linyphiidae) during 323 male-male contests using multivariate analysis. In contests over females, male ritualized displays include distinct phases by which males facultatively escalate fights: ritualized noncontact display, pedipalp wrestling, and unritualized biting and grappling. Amongst these phases we found evidence for all three types of assessment. Self-assessment was indicated by effects of the lighter male's mass and the metabolic effect of temperature. These factors influenced the duration of noncontact display, likelihood of escalation and energetic expenditures. Opponent assessment, indicated by the effects of the difference in mass between contestants, influenced all aspects of fight behaviour when differences in body mass were large. When differences in body mass were small, relative mass only affected the duration of the fight, primarily by lengthening noncontact display. Resource assessment, measured through effects of female reproductive value and the males' future reproductive opportunities, primarily influenced the decision to escalate to unritualized combat and the duration of the unritualized combat. Our multivariate analysis of behaviourally distinct phases of contests showed that contestants use diverse information to adjust investment in displays and potentially injurious fighting. We discuss the roles of information transfer versus raw attempts to influence outcomes in this complex contest system. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Owing to the nature of male competition over a nonshareable resource, cooperation and coalition formation are unexpected among mammalian males. Nevertheless, coalitions of unrelated males are widespread across mammals. Recently, a mathematical model for the evolution of male coalitions within groups was developed, predicting patterns and outcomes of coalitions depending on the degree of contest competition for mates. We tested this model in a species with presumably low-contest competition. Accordingly, under low contest, coalitions should be large, formed by mid- to low-ranking males targeting top-rankers and aimed at decreasing reproductive skew (all-up levelling coalitions). We also investigated the effect of scramble competition on coalitions, as its impact was not included in the model. Scramble competition is expected to be pronounced in our study population of Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, and thus we predicted that coalitions should target mainly young immigrants, irrespective of rank, to isolate them and eventually reduce male group size and, consequently, scramble competition. Data on social interactions, including coalitions, were collected on 23 males of a group of Barbary macaques living at Affenberg Salem, Germany. Coalition size was small, coalitions rarely targeted top-ranking males and all-up levelling coalitions were rare. Overall, the model was not confirmed. In contrast, more than three-quarters of coalitions targeted young immigrants, which were isolated from the group. Thus, male coalition formation in our group seemed to be influenced by scramble rather than contest competition. Both modes of competition should thus be taken into account if payoffs of coalition formation are investigated. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Animals often produce sounds that are focused in a particular direction relative to the caller's orientation. Although many studies have suggested ways in which directional signal design might have behavioural significance among vocally interacting individuals, there are few direct tests using experimental approaches. During the breeding season and while fasting on land, male northern elephant seals produce airborne threat calls during dyadic interactions when competing for mating opportunities. In this study, we investigated the directional cues of these calls and tested hypotheses regarding directional signalling with respect to the behaviour of receivers during vocally mediated male agonistic interactions. We then determined effects of vocal directionality on receiver responses using an acoustic playback approach. We found that male calls had substantial directionality, particularly at higher frequencies (> 1000 Hz). Subordinate males responded more strongly by retreating when the caller faced the receiver compared to when the caller was at a right angle or faced away. We also found a significant difference in responses to playback sequences with different call directivity patterns. Males displayed significantly more negative phonotaxis (i.e. moved away) in response to playbacks that simulated a caller oriented towards them compared to when playbacks simulated a caller oriented away from them. These results suggest that the directionality of threat calls provides important information about the auditory scene and spatial orientation of conspecifics and that this trait, along with the receiver's ability to extract this information, may have evolved as a consequence of its effect on the breeding success and fitness of the individual.

AB Birdsong is a well-known sexually selected trait that plays a major role in female choice and male e male interactions. Although birdsong has been studied for many years, it has only recently been suggested that it is a multifaceted signal that could encompass multiple sexually selected traits. According to the theories on the evolution and maintenance of multiple sexually selected signals, the different components of birdsong may signal multiple, redundant or unreliable information on male quality. We used a cross-sectional approach to examine whether the expression of song in the great tit was differentially related to any of three measures of quality: age, condition and survival. We analysed several informative characteristics in great tit song concerning diversity, output, performance and consistency to see whether different traits were simultaneously related to the studied quality parameters, or if, in contrast, each song trait was related to only one of the measures of quality. Song consistency and repertoire size were strongly related to only one of the studied parameters (age and survival, respectively), indicating that different song traits signal specific quality characteristics, and providing, therefore, evidence to support the multiple-signal hypothesis. Moreover, measures of song performance and song output (phrase and strophe rate) correlated positively with repertoire size, which might indicate that, at the same time, great tit song is signalling redundant information. In addition, some song characteristics did not correlate with any of the quality parameters measured, suggesting that those song traits might provide unreliable information.

AB Wild primates occupy large home ranges and travel long distances to reach goals. However, how primates are able to remember goal locations and travel efficiently is unclear. Few studies present consistent results regarding what reference system primates use to navigate, and what kind of spatial information they recognize. We analysed the pattern of navigation of one wild group of black capuchin monkeys, Cebus nigritus, at Atlantic Forest for 100 days in Carlos Botelho State Park (PECB), Brazil. We tested predictions based on the alternative hypotheses that black capuchin monkeys navigate using a sequence of landmarks as an egocentric reference system or an allocentric reference system, or both, depending on availability of food resources. The group location was recorded using a GPS device collecting coordinates at 5 min intervals, and route maps were generated using ArcView v9.3.1. The study group travelled through habitual routes during less than 30% of our study sample, and revisited resources from different starting points, using different paths and routes, even when prominent landmarks near feeding locations were not visible. The study group used habitual routes more frequently when high-quality foods were scarce, and navigated using different paths when revisiting food sources. Results support the hypothesis that black capuchin monkeys at PECB navigate using both egocentric and allocentric systems of reference, depending on the quality and distribution of the food resource they find.

AB In groups of cooperative breeders, individual fitness can increase as a direct consequence of group size, whereby the extent of these benefits is likely to depend, to a degree that is largely unknown, on the prevailing ecological conditions. We examined the effect of group size on pup production and survival across age classes in cooperatively breeding African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus, across 12 quasiexperimental sites in South Africa varying in ecological conditions. In this sample spanning over 43 pack-years, group size had a significantly positive effect on litter size after emergence from the den, but not on number of pups surviving to 1 year of age or survival rates for pups, yearlings and adults. Stronger relationships between these variables have been reported in other samples, so these results might be explained by low competitor density and high prey availability in our study areas. This explanation is supported by the finding that neither of these variables had any significant effect on pup production and survival across age classes in the present study. The results of our quasiexperimental study suggest that varying ecological conditions represent an important source of intraspecific variation in the impact of helpers in cooperative breeders.

AB Herbivorous insects recognize and locate their hosts by detecting characteristic blends of volatile compounds these plants emit. The possibility that insects may use the same compounds in a different context as nonhost cues has received relatively little attention. Volatiles normally emitted by the host but encountered without other host volatiles could theoretically function as nonhost cues. We hypothesized that insects might show a positive response to host volatile compounds when encountered together in a blend but avoid the same volatiles when encountered individually. To test this we examined the behavioural responses of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, to physiologically relevant doses of volatile compounds emitted by its host, Vicia faba, which had been previously implicated in host recognition. Of 15 volatiles tested for behavioural activity, 10 caused aphids to respond negatively, suggesting they were repellent. We then made a blend comprising each of these compounds at the concentration at which they elicited the most negative behavioural response. The resultant blend elicited a positive response, suggesting it was attractive/arrestant. This demonstrated that the same volatile compounds can function as both host and nonhost cues, depending upon the context in which they are perceived. Thus, background odour context needs to be considered for successful use of behaviourally active volatile compounds in integrated pest management strategies. Furthermore, the finding that odorants are perceived differently when combined suggests that there is an emergent property of odour perception whereby discrimination of odour quality can occur according to blend properties.

   BEHAVIOR
AB Animals from across the animal kingdom decrease feeding during an infection. Superficially this response seems maladaptive because the decline in food intake occurs at the same time as immune activation increases energy expenditure. However, illness-induced anorexia could be beneficial by decreasing trade-offs between the immune system and digestion. For example, in insects (i.e. crickets) there is a trade-off between lipid transport and immune function. We predicted that increasing the need for lipid transport (e.g. when digesting a high fat meal) would reduce immune function. After consuming a high fat meal, crickets (Gryllus texensis) showed an increase in haemolymph lipid concentration. Crickets also showed a decrease in resistance to bacterial infection (Serratia marcescens). After an immune challenge, crickets not only ate less, they also preferred foods containing less fat. This occurred whether the target food was an ecologically valid food item (dead cricket), natural foods (e.g. lettuce and ground meat) or an artificial diet containing different amounts of lipid. Therefore, the change in feeding behaviour after an immune challenge is consistent with the need to reduce lipid transport in order to maximize immune function. Illness-induced anorexia may be one method by which animals can bias physiological pathways towards enhanced immune function. Some behaviours may be adaptive because they can bias the direction of physiological trade-offs. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Signalling is a dynamic process that often occurs over brief timescales, particularly in the acoustic modality. Numerous studies of mate choice and acoustic communication have identified signal parameters essential for species recognition and mate preferences, although these studies have rarely considered the dynamic nature of these processes. Here we investigate mate choice behaviour in female tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, in response to temporally dynamic presentations of male advertisement calls. Our results demonstrate that females are sensitive to the location of preferred call types on a moment-to-moment basis, and that responses are influenced by the continued presence, complexity, sound pressure level and inherent attractiveness of individual male signals. In general, our results support the notion that decision making during mate choice is an open-ended process that is sensitive to interruption and persuasion from competing signallers. We show that for a species in which females actively compare multiple signallers simultaneously, the criterion that predicts the degree of commitment to an initial mate approach is whether there is a state change in the complexity of signals.

AB To improve foraging success or to enhance survival, animals may give out false signals to mislead prey or predators. Web decorations are purported to be structures that some orb-weaving spiders build to transmit deceptive signals to their advantage. Cyclosa ginnaga incorporates a variety of silk (silk decorations) and plant materials (plant detritus decorations) into its webs as decorations. It has been hypothesized that web decorations are deceptive signals that either attract prey, provide protection through camouflage or act as a warning signal. Nevertheless, despite numerous studies on web decorations, their function has remained elusive because of conflicting results. Using a combination of field video recording and the quanti. cation of colour contrasts in the visual systems of hymenopteran prey and passerine bird predators, we tested two functional hypotheses (prey attraction and predator defence) of two forms of web decorations (silk spiral and plant detritus) built by C. ginnaga. Silk-decorated, and to a lesser extent plant-decorated, webs intercepted more prey than undecorated webs, thus improving foraging success. This supports the prey attraction hypothesis; however, we could not rule out the predator defence hypothesis because there was no predation on spiders observed for any web with or without decorations.

AB Hosts that are infected by parasitoids pay the ultimate cost: death. Here we investigate whether hosts can combat the lethal effects of parasitoids by enhancing their grooming behaviour and removing the parasitoids before they have a chance to enter the host's body. Many field cricket species are stalked and parasitized by gravid females of the parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea. Female parasitoids lay live first-instar larvae (planidia) on and around the cricket. Planidia burrow into the cricket host where they feed and grow. Because parasitism invariably results in host death, there should be strong selection for crickets to avoid being parasitized. We investigated whether feld-caught Texas field crickets, Gryllus texensis, groom to avoid parasitism by O. ochracea. We quantified grooming behaviour of crickets when they were in the same area as O. ochracea adults or larvae (proximity avoidance), and following contact between the cricket and O. ochracea adults or larvae (contact avoidance). Crickets did not adjust grooming behaviour when in close proximity to adult gravid female O. ochracea, nor did they avoid planidia-laden grass. Crickets did, however, substantially increase their grooming activity when placed in an arena filled with planidia-laden grass. Furthermore, crickets that groomed more were much less likely to succumb to parasitoid infestation, compared to crickets that groomed less. Our findings suggest that grooming in G. texensis may function as a strong defence against parasitism by O. ochracea. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Red coloration has been associated with dominance and aggression in a number of animals. However, it is unclear whether the increased aggression of red individuals or the avoidance of red opponents is an intrinsic or learnt response. By experimentally controlling for genetic and environmental effects, I tested for innate competitive differences and red-enhanced contest success in sexually immature (uncoloured) red and black head colour morphs of the Gouldian finch, Erythrura gouldiae. Despite juveniles being reared by foster parents of the same and different colour morphs, there were no differences in competitive abilities between uncoloured red and black males. However, when I experimentally added a red head mask to uncoloured males, red (but not black and novel blue coloration) was associated with winning contests, irrespective of an individual's underlying genetics or postindependence social experience. In addition, uncoloured opponents expressed higher stress responses (corticosterone) and avoided conflicts with red-painted competitors. The association between red coloration and aggression may be an innate response to aid facultative fight or submissive decisions, and adds to growing evidence suggesting that red coloration may be a general signal of intimidation.

AB Infanticide is believed to be an adaptive strategy in many mammalian taxa. A number of authors have modelled aspects of infanticide and its potential impact on social systems, but limited attention has been paid to identifying the full range of conditions under which infanticide should be favoured or the variety of potential effects that infanticide may have on male mating strategies. While most authors focus on infanticide by new male immigrants, natural selection should favour infanticide under a wider range of conditions, including sometimes by potential fathers. Here we model male decisions about whether to commit infanticide and explore how infanticide risk may affect optimal male mating strategies. Infanticide risk coupled with imperfect infanticide protection in a population creates a fitness landscape with two adaptive peaks, one representing complete paternity certainty and the other representing a compromise between maximizing paternity and minimizing infanticide risk. Which of these adaptive peaks represents the fitness-maximizing global optimum depends on a population's socioecology and characteristics of the male. In many ecological contexts, males may adaptively reduce their paternity probability to reduce the risk of infanticide. Explicit consideration of this possibility may enhance our understanding of the dynamics of mammalian intrasexual and intersexual competition in a number of ways.

AB The grouping behaviour of fish is a widespread phenomenon of high biological significance but little is known as to how consistent individual behavioural differences may affect group joining preferences. When given the option to join either a shy or a bold shoal of three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, both shy and bold individuals showed a strong preference for associating with bold fish. Personality type interacted with individual hunger levels to affect the extent of association, suggesting important strategy variation by focal fish in a competitive foraging environment. Furthermore, shoals modified their behaviour in relation to the focal individual. Individual behavioural differences were shown to have a complex role in influencing association preferences as well as driving previously unrecognized behavioural modifications in foraging groups.

AB Polygyny is widely thought to be the dominant mating system in mammals. However, more recent genetic work casts doubt on this view. Variation in mating systems has been found in both males and females within and across mammalian species. The causes and consequences of mating system variation have important implications for understanding the population and evolutionary dynamics of species. To better understand mating system variation, both in mammals and more generally, this study analyses genetic mating system variation in dusky-footed woodrats, Neotoma fuscipes. Contrary to expectation, there was little support for polygyny at the genetic level. Instead, the study populations were characterized by promiscuity and monogamy, in both males and females. At higher densities, variance in the numbers of mates and offspring were higher in breeding males than in females, as is often observed. However, this trend was reversed in low-density, coniferous forest habitat. Model selection revealed that the best model of successfully mated pairs includes population density, operational sex ratio and individual pairwise distances as predictors. Higher densities coupled with male-biased sex ratios appear to decrease the probability of mating and decrease opportunities for polygamy, particularly in females. Although woodrats display sexual size dimorphism, male body size had no detectable effect on mating success. This study questions the prevalence of polygyny in mammals and demonstrates the need for more detailed, genetic investigations of mating systems. Future studies are needed to explore the complex interactions among mating system determinants and test hypotheses of sex-specific mating system variation.

DE alternative mating tactics; Australian painted dragon lizard;

ID SELECTION
AB Sexual selection may take place before or after mating and may involve a large number of different mechanisms, for example, overt male aggression, mate choice, sperm competition and cryptic female choice. In most species, males show similar reproductive tactics and, hence, achieve their reproductive success in the same or a similar way. Sometimes, however, males evolve alternative reproductive tactics. One such example is the polychromatic Australian painted dragon lizard, Ctenophorus pictus, in which red males beat yellow males in staged contests for females and show different emergence patterns post-hibernation in the wild with red males emerging to establish territories before yellow males do (at least in some years). Here we show that yellow males have significantly larger testes in relation to body size and condition than red males and copulate for a shorter period of time. Our mating experiments further showed that sperm storage played a significant role in male reproductive success (i.e. males sired offspring in later ovarian cycles than the one in which they actually mated). Furthermore, yellow males had a three times higher probability of paternity in some situations of sperm competition than red males, suggesting that male polymorphism may be associated with different reproductive tactics. 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID PREDATION RISK; CONSTRAINTS; PREFERENCE; COURTSHIP; BEHAVIOR
AB Females often have strong preferences for the most attractive males that provide the greatest benefits. However, searching for and sampling potential mates is costly. Females are therefore expected to make an optimizing choice whereby the benefits provided by the male outweigh the cost of choosing him. Consequently males should benefit by minimizing costs experienced by sampling females, or by reducing the ability of females to assess these costs. We investigated the economics of female mate choice in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi through observation of natural mate-searching behaviour, and by manipulating the costs of choice in a series of two-choice experiments using robotic crabs. Observed females were choosy about their mates, but this selectivity declined when predation risk increased. Experimental females were allowed to choose between males of different attractiveness at a range of distances from the female, with the more attractive male placed further from the female. Females did not travel further to reach a more attractive male except when distances were small. These results suggest that greater attractiveness does not always ensure greater mating success for males, as distant males experience a disadvantage. Male mate-attracting behaviour was then investigated, as male U. mjoebergi often leave their territories to approach sampling females, behaviour that may overcome a distance disadvantage. Males closely approached females regardless of their distance from the female. This behaviour is likely to prevent females from making the optimal choice, as they cannot include travel costs in their assessment of males.

AB Individual recognition is required in most social interactions, and its presence has been confirmed in many species. In birds, vocal cues appear to be a major component of recognition. Curiously, vocal recognition seems absent or limited in some highly social species such as the black-legged kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla. Using playback experiments, we found that kittiwake chicks recognized their parents vocally, this capacity being detectable as early as 20 days after hatching, the youngest age tested. Mates also recognized each other's long calls. Some birds reacted to their partner's voice when only a part of the long call was played back. Nevertheless, only about a third of the tested birds reacted to their mate's or parents' call and we were unable to detect recognition among neighbours. We discuss the low reactivity of kittiwakes in relation to their cliff-nesting habit and compare our results with evidence of vocal recognition in other larids.

AB In a recognition context, discriminating agents decide whether to accept or to reject. In the honeybee, entrance guards distinguish between nestmates and intruders. Those below a threshold of dissimilarity are accepted. However, the threshold is dependent on ecological conditions and may shift to become either restrictive or permissive, depending on the frequency of intrusion and cost of admitting an intruder. Previous research on the honeybee has shown that both the number of guards and their acceptance threshold to conspecific non-nestmates can change dramatically over weeks owing to changing nectar availability and robbing intensity. This project investigated whether these changes could also occur rapidly, over minutes, in response to sudden increases in conspecific intruders (robber bees). We induced high levels of intrusion at nest entrances and determined changes in the number of guards, the number of fights per guard, and the acceptance thresholds of guards. Our results show a rapid response within 15 min. At the level of individual guards, acceptance declined from 83 to 55% for nestmates and 67 to 43% for conspecific non-nestmates. Also, per individual guard, mean fights increased from 0.005 to 0.06 fights/guard. At the colony level, the mean number of guards at the entrance rose from 1.9 to 2.3, and overall acceptance in a 3-min trial declined from 74 to 52% for nestmates and 59 to 30% for conspecific non-nestmates. These results show that honeybees can make rapid behavioural shifts at both the colony and the individual levels. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB When food patch quality varies unpredictably over time, animals may benefit from sampling to track these changes. Previous theoretical work has shown how patch and environmental characteristics influence the optimal sampling policy, but there has been little attention to the effects of conspecifics, especially for species that do not live in groups. We used a simulation model to investigate the influence of conspecifics, as both competitors and providers of social information, on the optimal sampling behaviour of nongroup foragers. Competition reduces the range of patch characteristics for which frequent sampling provides a higher gain rate than rare or no sampling. Under conditions where sampling is beneficial, however, competition has little effect on the optimal sampling rate. Social information generally decreases the optimal sampling rate. However, the effect is small when the social information is unreliable. This will often occur when animals forage solitarily because of an inability to detect other animals at the patch or to distinguish animals that are sampling the patch from those that are exploiting it. Thus, the presence of conspecifics should reduce the sampling rate of nongroup foraging animals, but the extent of the reduction will depend on the reliability of the available social information.

AB We examined the trade-off between the behaviours associated with predator avoidance and mate acquisition in the mate-guarding amphipod crustacean Gammarus duebeni. We used laboratory experiments to investigate the impact of olfactory predator cues on activity, mate choice and mate-guarding behaviour of males and females. Pair formation declined under perceived risk of predation, reflecting reduced activity of both males and females and hence a reduced likelihood of encountering a mate. We also observed a reduction in the choosiness of both males and females. Under increased perceived predation risk, assessment of the female by the male was more likely to be followed by pair formation, and males showed a nonsignificant trend towards reduced discrimination in favour of large females and were less tenacious in their pair bond when they paired during exposure to predator cues. Females also showed less resistance behaviour, suggesting that both males and females trade off the costs of maximizing current reproductive success against the benefits of predator avoidance for survival and reproduction in the future. We discuss the implications of such context-dependent mating behaviours for ecological interactions between species and suggest that predators, via the effects of perceived predation risk on mate choice and mate guarding in the prey species, induce trait-mediated indirect effects with the potential to influence population dynamics and community structure.

AB Sound waves typically radiate from a vocalizing animal with unequal amplitude in different directions; this may profoundly affect communication, favouring adaptations that use or compensate for this directionality. Previous studies suggest that variation in directionality among vocalization types is related to function, with vocalizations such as alerts being relatively omnidirectional, thus maximizing the number of surrounding receivers, and vocalizations such as courtship calls being relatively directional, thus reducing eavesdropping by beaming sounds at the targeted receiver. Here we examine variation within a vocalization type, bird songs, to test hypotheses about how variation in song directionality relates to singing behaviour and the social context of singing. We measured the directionality and amplitude of red-winged blackbird songs in the Field using calibrated microphones encircling the bird. We found variation in directionality among song types, possibly allowing males to select songs from their repertoires with directionality to suit the social context. We found support for the hypothesis that the amplitude and directionality of songs are related, with more-directional songs delivered at higher amplitudes. In addition, we found support for the hypothesis that directionality is negatively related to the degree of male rotation on the perch between vocalizations, suggesting that males may combine omnidirectional songs and rotation to broadcast their songs, and may face the receiver and produce directional songs during direct interactions. We also observed variation in directionality among note types within songs. These results suggest that directionality plays an important role in shaping song structure and singing behaviour in red-winged blackbirds. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Reconciliation is defined as the first postconflict affinitive contact between former opponents. While reconciliation in anthropoid primates has been widely investigated, few studies have focused on postconflict mechanisms in prosimians, and only in captivity. Unlike anthropoids, Malagasy prosimians show female dominance, lack of sexual dimorphism and seasonal breeding. However, they share features with anthropoids such as cohesive societies, female philopatry and individual recognition. Comparing social prosimians with anthropoids is crucial for understanding the evolution of reconciliation dynamics. Here we present the first study on reconciliation in a wild prosimian. We focused on the Propithecus verreauxi (sifaka) of the Berenty forest (southern Madagascar). We examined postconflict behaviour in the light of theoretical expectations based on potential costs and benefits of the individuals involved. Our results indicate that P. verreauxi can evaluate possible risks and benefits of engaging in postconflict reunions. Victims were most likely to interact affinitively with the aggressor after low-intensity aggression. Moreover, only the conflicts occurring outside the feeding context were reconciled. Such results are consonant with the fact that, in P. verreauxi, social dominance is translated more into feeding priority than into a framework of despotic relationships. In agreement with the valuable relationship hypothesis, P. verreauxi were more likely to reconcile with valuable partners: reconciliation preferentially occurred between subordinates and top- ranking individuals, and between animals sharing good relationships (high levels of affinitive behaviours). Over the short term, reconciliation in P. verreauxi seems to have an important role in reducing the probability of further attacks by the aggressor.

AB Brood parasites and predators pose unique threats that may favour the evolution of enemy-specific defence strategies. We considered whether reed warblers, Acrocephalus scirpaceus, have a specific alarm call for common cuckoos, Cuculus canorus, and whether their alarms attract mates and neighbours. Mounts of cuckoos ( threat to nest but harmless to adults) were significantly more likely to be mobbed and were mobbed more strongly, with rasp calls and mandible snaps, than mounts of sparrowhawks, Accipiter nisus ( threat to adults only), or teal, Anas crecca ( a harmless control). However, calls were not acoustically specific to the kind of enemy presented, but rather varied in usage with mount distance from the nest and mount species. This suggests that reed warbler alarm signals are not functionally referential, but rather convey immediacy of threat to the nest. Mates and neighbours often approached during calling, and playback experiments confirmed they were more likely to be attracted by mobbing calls than by control calls. The response was graded, with higher repetition rates of mobbing calls attracting more individuals. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that mobbing calls functioned solely to attract mates and neighbours because calling continued even after these were attracted and was not more likely when there were close neighbouring nests, and attracted neighbours were sometimes chased away by residents. Our results show that reed warblers discriminate a brood parasite from both a dangerous species and an innocuous species by using graded alarm signals that attract conspecifics. This is compatible with the idea that nest defence by reed warblers includes a specific evolved response to brood parasitism. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Mimetic songs of superb lyrebirds, Menura novaehollandiae, were investigated to evaluate the effects of population and age class on model selection and mimetic accuracy. Two geographically isolated populations with similar habitat and sympatric avian species mimicked the same vocalizations from almost identical species of avian models and failed to mimic the same suite of potential models. Mimetic song had a similar structure at the two sites: diversity of song items and performance rate were not significantly different. However, the populations differed in the frequency some models were repeated in a bout of song. We compared the acoustic structure of lyrebird copies to the physically challenging song of the eastern whipbird, Psophodes olivaceus, and the complex contact call of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, Calyptorhynchus funereus. Lyrebirds could not match the duration of the sustained monotone note of the whipbird nor the demanding frequency bandwidth of the explosive whipcrack. There was a significant positive correlation between whipcrack bandwidth and diversity of mimetic items which suggests consistent individual differences in mimetic performance. Contact calls of cockatoos and lyrebird copies were also distinguishable but less so than with the whipcrack. Subadults made much poorer copies of these models than did the adult lyrebirds and had fewer identifiable heterospecific song items suggesting that costs are associated with the development of mimetic song. Together, these findings are consistent with a female choice hypothesis where females prefer males that mimic more accurately and have a greater diversity of mimetic items, but experimental veri. cation is needed.

AB Scorpions are negatively phototactic animals, and physiological data suggests that their photoreceptors are differentially sensitive to light wavelengths ranging from red to ultraviolet. However, behaviour modi. cation resulting from exposure to different wavelengths has not been established. We monitored behavioural responses of animals in small circular arenas while they were presented with different wavelengths of light ( red, green, UV, or no light) matched for intensity. In the. rst experiment using desert grassland scorpions, Paruroctonus utahensis, half of each arena received the light treatment, while the other half was shaded. The results indicated that the amount of time that scorpions spent on the light-exposed side varied depending on the treatment and that avoidance was greatest for UV light followed by green light. In subsequent experiments using both P. utahensis and striped bark scorpions, Centruroides vittatus, the entire arena was subjected to the particular light wavelength while animal locomotory activity was monitored. We found no significant difference in animal responses to randomized, sequential 30 min presentations of all four light treatments. Scorpion activity was greatest during the. rst 10 min of the 30 min trials; in the. rst 5 min period, the highest activity levels were in the UV light treatments, followed by the green light treatments. In behavioural tests to either green or IR light, animals moved sporadically and significantly faster under green light compared to IR light treatments. Taken together, we conclude that different wavelengths of light affect scorpion locomotory behaviour differently. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Benjamin Beck's definition of tool use has served the field of animal cognition well for over 25 years (Beck 1980, Animal Tool Behavior: the Use and Manufacture of Tools, New York, Garland STPM). This article proposes a new, more explanatory definition that accounts for tool use in terms of two complementary subcategories of behaviours: behaviours aimed at altering a target object by mechanical means and behaviours that mediate the flow of information between the tool user and the environment or other organisms in the environment. The conceptual foundation and implications of the new definition are contrasted with those of existing definitions, particularly Beck's. The new definition is informally evaluated with respect to a set of scenarios that highlights differences from Beck's definition as well as those of others in the literature.

AB Birds usually dustbathe in litter, but in the absence of this they sham dustbathe. The question addressed in this study was whether laying hens, Gallus gallus domesticus reared without litter and used to performing sham dustbathing consider this to be 'real' dustbathing and are satisfied with this or, if given the opportunity, would choose to dustbathe in a functional substrate? We used the push-door as the operant method to quantify motivation to dustbathe in 28 adult laying hens from four different treatments. The treatments reflected different previous experiences of litter and were based on the time period during rearing that birds had been housed with access to peat: (1) never, (2) early rearing, (3) late rearing and (4) always. All hens were deprived of peat before the start of the test, which was carried out when the birds were adults, and they were tested every fifth day in a series of trials with increasing resistance of the push-door. A hen was removed from the test when she no longer successfully pushed through the door. The results showed that there was no difference between treatments in the weight of doors that hens pushed open to gain access to peat. This implies that sham dustbathing is not satisfying or perceived as normal dustbathing, even for birds that developed dustbathing behaviour in the absence of litter because birds that had no previous experience of peat were as motivated to work to gain access to this substrate as birds used to dustbathing in peat.

AB In eusocial Hymenoptera, the ability of workers to reproduce is a cause of conflict, both between the queen and workers and among workers. Reproductive decisions by workers depend on parameters such as colony size (which reduces the cost of selfish reproduction for the colony) or queen fertility. Indeed, queen signals inhibit reproduction from workers either by coercion or because of self-restraint. Multinest societies called polydomous facilitate the collection of scattered food and colony movement in an unstable environment. In these societies, queen signal dispersion could be hindered by the physical absence of queen in some nests. Here we investigate how polydomy influences worker behaviour in a monogynous polydomous ant, the ponerinae Pachycondyla goeldii. A recent field study has shown that P. goeldii workers display a significantly higher ovarian development in secondary (queenless) than in primary (queenright) nests. In the present study we show that P. goeldii workers change they behaviour when they colonize new nests, displaying significantly more agonistic behaviours in secondary than in primary nests. Behavioural changes and ovary development of workers from secondary nests are probably because of a decrease of queen signal intensity in their nests. The rise of agonistic behaviour in these nests stems from mechanisms regulating the reproduction of workers such as policing or hierarchy set-up. Our results lead us to favour the hypothesis of hierarchy establishment between workers in the secondary nests, which characterize large colonies. Pachycondyla goeldii colonies therefore maximize their reproductive output by triggering worker reproduction when colony size increases. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID EUROPEAN STARLINGS; PLANTS; NESTLINGS; PREFERENCES; CHICK
AB Male European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, incorporate fresh volatile herbs into their nests. This behaviour is related to courtship but also benefits the nestlings. We tested in aviary experiments whether males select aromatic plants using olfaction and whether they depend on experience with nest odours they encountered as nestlings. We scented nests of wild starlings with milfoil, Achillea millefolium, a preferred nest plant of the starlings, and other control nests with vanilla. Fledglings from both nest types were hand- reared and tested the following year in dyadic choice experiments for their odour preference. Males from both milfoi-land vanilla- treated nests preferred milfoil scent when they had the choice between milfoil- scented versus vanilla- scented or versus unscented leaves. However, when they had to choose between vanilla scent and no scent, males from vanilla- treated nests chose vanilla scent but males from milfoil- treated nests did not discriminate. The disinterest of vanilla- inexperienced males in vanilla- scented leaves ( when milfoil scent was lacking) and the preference for it in vanilla- experienced males implies learning during the nestling period. Because males discriminated between leaves of the same plant species looking the same but scented with different odours and because males without milfoil experience instantly preferred milfoil odour, we conclude that starlings use olfactory cues to select green nest material following an olfactory pattern designed prior to birth which may be supplemented by learning early in ontogeny.

AB Evolutionary theory predicts that mothers will direct care preferentially to their own offspring. This may be difficult when mothers nest communally, as occurs with degus, a social South American rodent. We used an olfactory habituation-discrimination technique to determine whether co-nesting mothers could discriminate among the odours of young that differed with respect to relatedness (a mother's own offspring or not), familiarity (a mother and pup did or did not occupy the same cage) or both. We tested mothers that were housed with an unrelated female and her litter (experiment 1) or a sister and her litter (experiment 11) and conducted tests when pups were 2 weeks old (during lactation, experiments I and 11) and 6 weeks old (after weaning, experiment 1). In experiment I, lactating mothers discriminated between the odours of their own pups and their co-nesting partner's pups, and between the odours of their own pups and unfamiliar pups, but not between odours of their co-nesting partner's pups and unfamiliar pups. After weaning, however, mothers discriminated between odours based on familiarity, but not kinship. In experiment II, lactating mothers discriminated between the odours of their own offspring and their co-nesting sister's pups. Thus, degu mothers could distinguish between their own offspring and those of their co-nesting partner whether mothers were related or not. Mothers could therefore potentially use olfactory cues to care discriminatively for pups they encounter in their communal nest. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although many descriptive studies of foraging mode have been performed, the factors that underlie the evolution of foraging mode remain poorly understood. To test the hypothesis that foraging mode evolution is affected by habitat use, we analysed two data sets including 31 species of West Indian Anolis lizards. In this genus, the same suite of habitat specialists (or ecomorphs) has evolved on four islands, providing the replication necessary to evaluate the generality of the relationship between foraging mode and habitat use. Using habitat and behavioural data, we conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses to determine whether species of the same ecomorph have evolved similar foraging behaviour and whether differences in foraging mode are associated with differences in habitat use. We found that Anolis species show substantial variation in foraging behaviour, including differences in movement and eating rates. Furthermore, variation among ecomorphs indicates that foraging behaviour is related to habitat use, although the specific environmental factors driving foraging divergence are unclear. Our results show that foraging mode is an evolutionarily labile trait that is influenced by evolution of habitat use. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Several models have recently confirmed the hypothesis that mean group size should increase with population density in animal species in which groups are unstable. Based upon different assumptions with respect to the mechanisms of groups merging and splitting up, these models, however, predict quantitatively different relations between mean group size and population density. Taking advantage of a quasiexperimental situation, we studied the diurnal group dynamics of the Pyrenean chamois within a 58-ha open pasture in a protected area during winter. Mean group size scaled with local population density raised to the power of 2/3 within the pasture, which implies that the mean number of groups was related to the cube root of local population density. On the basis of the fate of groups that included tagged individuals, we found that: (1) the rate at which groups joined increased as the number of groups within the pasture increased; (2) the rate at which groups split up increased with their size; and (3) the rate at which groups were involved in both fusion and fission events increased as the local population density increased. We discuss the possible role of population spatial structure and mother-kid association in both the dynamics of group formation and the relations between mean group size and population density.

AB We quantify and compare female preference for two different acoustic parameters of the male advertisement call in two species of midwife toads where females select mates based on call characteristics. The parameters compared were: call repetition rate, a highly variable parameter associated with male-male competition, and call dominant frequency, a parameter with low variability related to male size. We also tested whether intensity of female preference was similar when the alternate choices were perceived at high overall intensities (close range) or lower overall intensities (long range). We use 'Playback setpoints' a new experimental protocol based on two-speaker playback tests with the female placed in a ferret wheel (treadmill) that keeps her equidistant from the two speakers. The protocol measures preference as a trade-off with perceived call intensity: the 'a priori' preferred parameter is not broadcast initially, and the female initially walks towards the speaker emitting the inferior parameter. When the female walks towards this speaker the intensity of the opposite speaker is gradually increased until the female turns around and starts her approach towards the 'a priori' preferred parameter. At this point the differences in sound intensity between the speakers are measured, and the difference is considered to be a measure of female preference. Our results show that female preference for call repetition rate is significantly more intense than that for dominant frequency. Similarly, we find that female preference intensity is higher when stimuli are broadcast at higher overall intensity indicating that females are more selective at close range.

ID PIGMENT PATTERN
AB The zebrafish has become a major model system for biomedical research and is an emerging model for the study of behaviour. Although adult zebrafish express a visually mediated shoaling preference, the onset of shoaling behaviour and of this preference is unknown. To assess the onset of these behaviours, we first manipulated the early social environment of larval zebrafish subjects, giving them three model shoaling partners of the same pigment phenotype. We then assayed the subjects' preferences using binary preference tests in which we presented subjects with two shoals, one shoal of fish showing the same pigment pattern phenotype as their models and another shoal with a radically different pigment pattern. To determine whether the visually mediated preference could be altered once it was established, we further manipulated the social environment of a number of subjects, rearing them with one model shoal and testing them, then changing their social consorts and retesting them. Our results show that larval zebrafish shoal early in their development, but do not show a shoaling preference until they are juveniles. Moreover, we found that the shoaling preference was stable, as changing the social environment of fish after they had acquired a preference did not change their preference. These findings will facilitate investigations into the mechanisms underlying social behaviour in this vertebrate model system. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In large mammalian herbivores, herd size usually increases with openness of the environment, but the proximate mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain poorly known. We investigated the dynamics of group formation in a population of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, living in open cultivated plain. Our results show the high spontaneous instability of groups. The probability of fission per unit time increased approximately as the square of group size, and the sizes of the groups resulting from a splitting-up followed a uniform distribution. Attraction between groups was the main cause of fusion and was at work over distances of more than 200 m, far exceeding the perception radius of roe deer in forest. In addition, when not yet separated by than more than 200 m, two groups resulting from a single splitting-up had a high probability of remerging and restoring the parent group. Our results are thus consistent with the assumption that in large herbivores group size increases with habitat openness, not because of a change in individual's behaviour, but because groups are unstable and any increase of the distance at which animals perceive one another enhances the rate at which groups merge.

AB A small-male mating advantage has been only rarely encountered in territorial species and may be an artefact of selection on covarying traits linked to flight-related body morphology. Here, we explicitly tested its occurrence in the territorial damselfly, Lestes viridis, while taking into account two key traits shaping flight performance: relative thorax mass and wing asymmetry. Morphological correlates of mating success were determined by comparing sets of mated and unmated males in a natural population at two different collection dates. We showed consistent morphometric differences between mated and unmated males across both sampling dates, suggesting consistent sexual selection on these traits. Mated males were smaller, had a higher relative thorax mass ( proxy for flight-muscle ratio), and showed lower levels of fluctuating asymmetry in the hindwings compared with unmated males. Moreover, these patterns remained when taking their potential covariation into account, suggesting they were directly selected for. As such, we provided the first multivariate proof for a small-male mating advantage in a territorial species taking into account two other key traits related to flight-related body morphology. Given the assumed mechanistic base ( low energy consumption and high flight manoeuvrability), we hypothesize that a small-male mating advantage may not be that rare in flying territorial species.

AB Satellite male horseshoe crabs form spawning groups around some nesting pairs ( female plus attached male) while leaving others to nest alone. Furthermore, females of pairs that attract satellites are larger and lay more eggs than females of pairs that do not attract satellites. We experimentally tested whether satellite males use visual cues to discriminate among large and small females and if satellites use chemical cues from eggs to distinguish among females. We conducted experiments in the field in the northern Gulf of Mexico at Seahorse Key, FL, U. S. A. in which we observed the behaviour of satellite males as they approached cement models of horseshoe crab pairs. Satellites were significantly more likely to approach and join model pairs with large females than with small females. However, there was no difference in the length of time satellites remained joined to the models. When chemical cues were examined, there was no difference in the number of males that approached or joined identical female models with and without eggs. However, once a satellite joined, it remained attached significantly longer to the model pair with eggs underneath. This study shows that satellite male horseshoe crabs use multiple cues, first visual to locate nesting pairs, then chemical to decide whether to remain with a nesting female. Our results show that males that are approaching from the water use visual cues from the amount of exposed carapace to distinguish the size of females nesting on land, even when those females are well buried in the sand.

AB Previously limited to laboratory studies, the deleterious effects of inbreeding are now being revealed in a number of wild systems. Female North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, show high levels of multimale mating and little to no overt precopulatory mate selection. We hypothesized that the negative repercussions of inbreeding should select for a female's ability to select sperm from more distantly related males. Consequently, successful sires should be less genetically related to the female than are unsuccessful males. We tested this hypothesis using both an analysis of absolute success among all copulating males and also relative success of sires within multiply sired litters. Pairwise genetic relatedness and paternity were determined through molecular analysis of tissue samples collected from reproductive females, copulating males and resultant offspring. In contrast to other systems, we found no evidence that the genetic similarity of mates predicts patterns of parentage in red squirrels. Genetic relatedness did not predict whether a copulating male would sire any offspring, and relative success of sires within multiply sired litters was unrelated to their relatedness to the dam of the litter. Furthermore, selection for inbreeding avoidance mechanisms may be minimal, as there were no observable negative fitness repercussions to inbreeding. We detected no relationship between the genetic relatedness of an offspring's parents and its neonatal mass, growth rate or survival to reproductive age. In red squirrels, we found no evidence of parentage patterns based on genetic similarity of mates, and this phenomenon may be less universal than previously thought.

AB Geographical variation in the structure of mating signals can influence the processes of mate recognition and reproductive isolation. In Darwin's finches of the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, prior studies of geographical variation in vocal mating signals (songs) have focused on populations on small islands, on which there is presumably little opportunity for the evolution of within-island song variation or discrimination abilities. The situation on larger islands, however, is less clear. I characterized aspects of song variation and discrimination in the medium ground finch, Geospiza fortis, in the southeastern coastal region of the large island of Santa Cruz. Songs from two sites, Bahia Academia and El Garrapatero, separated by approximately 11 km, differed in mean minimum frequency and in a corresponding principal component factor, and could be distinguished with moderate success in discriminant function analysis. Territorial males at El Garrapatero showed strong discrimination of songs by site: in response to playback of local songs, birds showed higher rates of singing and flying, and significantly closer approaches to the playback speaker. Successful discrimination of songs by site, in the face of overlap in song structure between these sites, suggests that these birds rely on an exemplar-based mechanism of song perception. Moreover, the results support the hypothesis that birds in these populations are relatively philopatric, and thus suggest an opportunity for within-island evolutionary divergence. 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Vigilance activity is usually considered an adaptive advantage of group living conferring protection against predators. An individual of a prey species is assumed to benefit from an increase in the number of group members by reducing its own investment in vigilance. However, the proximate mechanism generating the decrease in vigilance with increasing group size is unclear. Most models of this relation assume that either individuals coordinate their scans in nonoverlapping bouts of vigilance or animals scan independently of one another. We studied the relation between vigilance and group size in the eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus, analysing vigilance at two structural levels, individual vigilance and collective vigilance of the group. We tested both assumptions, coordination and independence of scanning. The time that an individual spent vigilant decreased with group size. However, the time during which at least one individual in the group scanned the environment (collective vigilance) increased up to a group size of seven individuals but decreased thereafter. Analyses revealed that individuals neither coordinated their scanning in an asynchronous way nor scanned independently of one another. On the contrary, both the onset and the end of individuals' scanning bouts were synchronized between group members, producing waves of collective vigilance. Bouts of vigilance and nonvigilance activity tended to be synchronized. Our results appear to support a hypothesis of allelomimetic vigilance.

AB We tested common marmosets' understanding of visual access in a series of experiments. In experiment 1, we investigated whether marmosets know what conspecifics do and do not see, using a food competition paradigm originally developed for chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. Subordinate marmosets consistently chose a piece of food only visible to them and not one that was visible to a dominant competitor as well, indicating a simple mentalistic understanding of visual access (level-1 perspective taking). In experiment 2, we aimed to validate these results by using a different experimental approach, building on the marmosets' ability to use gaze as a cue. Although the marmosets precisely extrapolated gaze direction, no understanding of visual access could be found in this task. In experiment 3, we tested an alternative mechanism to account for the positive outcome in experiment 1. The results suggested that the marmosets had a predisposition to treat a piece of food that was looked at by another individual as belonging to that individual and to avoid it. The marmosets overall showed high proficiency in exactly extrapolating gaze direction but failed to show consistent and context-independent perspective-taking abilities. The findings are discussed with regard to results from other primate species and, from a broader evolutionary perspective, with regard to their implications for the emergence of sophisticated forms of gaze understanding in humans.

AB Scatter-hoarding birds show superior performance in many spatial memory tasks and appear to relocate sites using different cues than nonscatter hoarders. However, there have not been similar studies of cue use and memory for locations by mammals that differ in their reliance on scatter hoards for survival. Here we report differences in spatial memory in two species of kangaroo rats that are predicted by foraging ecology. Merriam's kangaroo rat, Dipodomys merriami, a scatter hoarder that hoards intensively, showed accurate memory on a cache simulation task, which required the rat to find four predetermined locations after a 24-h delay. In contrast, the leaf-eating specialist Great Basin kangaroo rat, D. microps, which relies less on scatter hoarding, showed poorer accuracy under the same experimental conditions. The presence of local landmarks did not differentially affect recovery in the two species of kangaroo rats, unlike previous studies in birds. We did find a significant interaction between the presence of local landmarks and sex on target recovery. Female performance was significantly impaired by the absence of local landmarks, while male performance was unaltered. Spatial ecology predicted both species and sex differences in spatial memory in kangaroo rats. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study or Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Unlike most eutherian mammals, which have dichromatic (two-colour) vision, most platyrrhine primate species have polymorphic colour vision. This unique characteristic is enabled via multiple alleles for a mid-to long-wavelength-sensitive (M/LWS), single-locus opsin gene on the X chromosome. In combination with the autosomal opsin common to most vertebrates, this arrangement provides heterozygous females with trichromatic (three-colour) vision, whereas homozygous females and males are dichromats. Trichromatic vision enables visual differentiation among longer-wavelength colours, such as red, orange, yellow and green. Currently, many researchers attribute the evolution and maintenance of polymorphic colour vision to trichromat (= heterozygote) advantage. However, dichromacy may be more suited for achromatic tasks, such as penetrating colour camouflage, especially under low-light conditions. We evaluated whether dichromatic capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) were more efficient than trichromatic monkeys at capturing camouflaged and noncamouflaged insects. Through faecal DNA analysis, we determined the genotypes of the M/LWS opsins for 34 capuchins in two groups inhabiting Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. Dichromatic monkeys were more efficient at detecting camouflaged, surface-dwelling insects, especially under conditions of low ambient light. However, unexpectedly, trichromats were more efficient in extracting embedded, noncamouflaged insects from substrates. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document a foraging advantage to dichromatic monkeys in the wild. Our findings show that there is a lack of heterozygote advantage in foraging for surface-dwelling insects and therefore indicate that this mechanism may not be the sole driving force maintaining polymorphic colour vision in this population.

   SELECTION; POLYANDRY; RECEPTIVITY
AB A female's willingness to copulate (i.e. her receptivity) can depend on several endogenous, environmental and social factors. The black scavenger or dung fly, Sepsis cynipsea (Diptera: Sepsidae), is a classic example of strong female reluctance to mate and sexual conflict over mating. Laboratory studies have found high variability in female receptivity and even virgins unwilling to mate. The aim of this study was to determine the proximate factors influencing female receptivity. Fresh dung was necessary for egg production. Female receptivity strongly depended on a female's egg-laying cycle rather than age: receptivity was highest when females had no ripe eggs. The absence of eggs in the female's reproductive tract is probably required for spermatophore transfer, leading to the unusual precopulatory guarding and postoviposition mating of sepsids. Nonvirgins were less receptive than virgins, except when they were in need of sperm, and more receptive when they were larger and had previously laid more eggs. Only when not in need of sperm did females copulate with males larger than their previous mate. This suggests sequential female choice, but females typically copulated with the first of up to 10 presented males or not at all, provided that they were at the appropriate stage of their laying cycle. Female unwillingness to mate in this and probably other species therefore has various, sometimes physiological (intrinsic) causes. These must be controlled in experiments assessing mate choice, costs and benefits of mating, or sexual conflict. Not taking into account female egg-laying state can mask female choice, bias data and suggest wrong associations. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Chimpanzees produce specific vocalizations, 'rough grunts', when encountering food, and it has been suggested that these calls vary acoustically depending on the food type discovered by the caller. Nearby listeners often behave as if the calls are meaningful to them, indicating that the calls may function as referential labels for particular foods. We investigated whether rough grunt variants are the result of callers responding to specific food types or relative food preferences. We recorded calls from captive individuals in response to nine different food items, which could be ranked as high, medium or low preference. Individuals consistently produced three acoustically distinct grunt variants to the three food preference classes. There was no evidence that chimpanzees produced individual labels for food types of low and medium preference. However, calls to high-preference food types differed significantly in their acoustic structure. These acoustic patterns remained stable over trials, suggesting that rough grunts have the potential to serve as semantic labels for individual high-preference food types. We were unable to replicate these findings with a set of recordings from the wild, although most other aspects of calling behaviour remained identical. We discuss these discrepancies between the wild and captivity and suggest that the emergence of referential labels for food items may be a by-product of the special circumstances found in captive settings.

AB Sexual selection is the outcome of behavioural interactions within and between the sexes. Numerous studies show how individuals modify their sexual behaviour in response to ecological or social conditions, and such changes may therefore affect the evolutionary outcome of sexual selection. Our study examined the effect of habitat structure on the sexual behaviour of male and female guppies, Poecilia reticulata. We asked whether the ability of males to observe other courting males would affect the rates of male courtship and courtship interference and the sexual responsiveness of females. Specifically, we manipulated visibility using opaque barriers in laboratory aquaria and found that there was less male interference behaviour in aquaria containing visual obstructions than in aquaria without barriers, regardless of whether the male was courting sexually responsive (virgin) or unresponsive (nonvirgin) females. In addition, sexual responsiveness of virgin females to male displays was significantly increased in aquaria with barriers relative to aquaria without barriers. Finally, the display frequency of males courting virgin females was significantly reduced in aquaria with barriers, probably as a result of the females' increased rate of sexual response. Evidently, the barriers impede visibility enough that males are less likely to observe and interfere with the courtship of other males, and therefore, females are less likely to flee or lose interest in a courting male. Ultimately, characteristics of the visual environment could affect females' ability to choose mates and in turn could potentially affect the evolutionary outcome of sexual selection.

AB Food and predators are thought to have independent effects on avian reproductive success. Several studies have now shown that extra food can reduce nest predation rates. Most hypotheses suggest that this is due to changes in adult and/or nestling behaviour. A critical test as to whether behaviour is key, is to examine when predation events occur for birds with and without extra food. If behaviour is important, extra food should lead to fewer nest predation events during the day, when birds are active, but have no effect at night. We conducted a food supplementation experiment on song sparrows and tested for food effects on timing of nest predation events, adult antipredator behaviour and nestling begging behaviour. Food supplementation significantly reduced the relative frequency of daytime nest predation especially during incubation. During incubation, fed females had shorter foraging bouts and longer bouts on the nest, and these behaviours were associated with a reduced probability of being preyed upon. During brooding, we found trends (P < 0.1) towards lower daytime predation and greater adult nest attendance for fed birds than for unfed birds, but nestling begging did not differ with food treatment. Our results show that food availability does influence nest predation through its effect on antipredator behaviour. We highlight the importance of examining adult behaviour and vulnerability to predation at both stages of the nesting period because behavioural changes with extra food were extreme at the egg stage and were more effective at reducing nest predation than were behavioural changes at the nestling stage.

AB To study factors important to the success of wolves, Canis lupus, hunting moose, Alces alces, we analysed data from more than 4000 km of snow tracking of wolves during 1998-2003 in Scandinavia. We used two methods to estimate hunting success for 17 wolf territories from 185 observations of wolf attacks on moose. On average, hunting success was estimated at 45 and 64% for the two methods, respectively. We used a smaller data set (N = 142) to examine the effect of age of breeding wolves, hunting group size, snow depth and moose density on hunting success. Multiple logistic regression showed that age of breeding males was the only variable significantly related to hunting success, with maximum hunting success at 4.5-5.5+ years of age. We also studied prey selection of radiocollared adult wolves over successive winters in two wolf packs that lost one of the breeding wolves. Whereas the surviving adult female switched to prey on roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, the surviving adult male continued mainly to select moose. Our results suggest that the positive effect of male age on hunting success reflects both increased experience of attacking prey and possibly the greater size of adult male wolves (25-30%) compared to adult female wolves.

ID REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; PEACOCKS; CHOICE; BIRDS; TITS
AB Although birds are highly patterned animals, the efficacy and information content of complex colour signalling by combining multiple feathers has rarely been investigated. We examine a melanin-dependent plumage pattern in the red-legged partridge, Alectoris rufa, in a captive breeding facility in Spain. Both males and females are striking in that the majority of the entire side of the body is covered with a bold brown, black and white vertical pattern. During agonistic displays the feathers are aligned in nearly perfect, continuous dorsoventral 'flank bands'. We report on the unusual morphology and developmental complexity of the pattern, including the number and anatomical location of the display feathers. We investigate whether the area of any of the three colours of individual feathers was a signal of a bird's quality. Black alone varied significantly with age, sex and mass scaled to body size in both sexes, as well as the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio of females. Birds in poor condition appear not to be able to pigment the feather completely to its edge. The negative correlation between the black areas of the display feathers of mated pairs and the negative correlation between male ornament size and reproductive success suggest various behavioural associations with colour. Plumage patterns provide many more potential opportunities for signalling an individual's quality than overall colour alone, and they have the advantage that they can be turned off and on at the appropriate time through behavioural modification.

AB The net cost of reproduction and the trade-off between reproduction and life span are affected by many male and female adaptations. Because several of these adaptations are sexually selected, we expect the cost of reproduction to be affected by sexual selection. For example, traits favoured in males by sexual selection may increase costs of mating for females. We conducted a series of experiments where we independently varied female exposure to males and access to oviposition substrates in six congeneric seed beetle species (Callosobruchus spp.). These experiments allowed us to partition the cost of reproduction for females into the cost of mating and the cost of egg production. The costs and benefits of a single mating in terms of effects on female life span varied markedly between species. In some species, females lived for longer after mating once but others had a shortened life span. Lifelong cohabitation with males resulted in a shortened life span for females of all species, but the extent to which cohabitation reduced female life span varied between species. We also found partial support for a depressed lifetime egg production as a result of cohabitation with males. Collectively, our results show that the costs and benefits of mating vary markedly within this clade of closely related and ecologically uniform species. We conclude that key traits, which influence the economics of sexual interactions and reproduction, have evolved rapidly in this model system.

AB The two closely related parasitoids Cotesia glomerata and C. rubecula (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) coexist in The Netherlands where they occupy slightly different niches. When searching for their caterpillar hosts, they use host plant odours that are released upon feeding by the caterpillars. The species differ in their preference for plant odours during host searching after an associative learning experience. Cotesia glomerata changes its preference for the odour of a particular plant species after an oviposition experience on that plant, whereas C. rubecula does not alter its naive preference. Using no-choice wind tunnel bioassays we tested, for both species, to what extent oviposition induces memory formation and whether this results from associative learning. In experiment 1 we characterized the temporal dynamics of the memory trace. In both species, oviposition experience induced increased response levels compared to those of naive wasps. Memory dynamics differed between the species. A single associative learning experience induced a stable long-lasting memory trace that persisted for at least 5 days in C. glomerata. In C. rubecula a memory trace for the odour was present during the first day after the oviposition experience but waned over the following days. From a second experiment we concluded that the increased response could be attributed to a combination of nonassociative and associative learning. We furthermore formulate the learning paradigm for the parasitoids and hypothesize that adaptation to different spatial distributions of the preferred host species has led to the observed differences in memory dynamics.

AB The function and adaptive value of tail wagging in many bird species are not yet fully understood. Possible functions are flushing insects, displaying submission and signalling an individual's state of alertness to predators. To distinguish between these, I observed feeding and preening white wagtails in August-September 2004 near Husum, Germany. I counted vigilance events (head-up and left-right scans), tail wags and pecks during feeding. Adults and juveniles did not differ in the frequency of tail wagging. Feeding wagtails wagged more often than preening wagtails and, among feeding wagtails, wagging was positively correlated with scanning and negatively correlated with pecking. In preening wagtails wagging was positively correlated with left-right scans. The prey-flushing hypothesis was partially supported, but seems unlikely since wagging occurred during preening and was negatively correlated with pecking. As wagging did not differ between adults and juveniles it is unlikely to signal submission. It may be an honest signal of vigilance during both feeding and preening; this would explain the negative correlation between wagging and pecking because wagtails adopt a nonvigilant posture during pecking.

AB Why do males exert strong mate choice in some taxa but not others? Theory suggests that mate discrimination will enhance male fitness when encounter rates with potential mates are high, when those potential mates vary in the fitness consequences likely to accrue from an attempted insemination, and when courting one female reduces the male's opportunity to court other females. One widespread form of mate choice involves a trend for males of many ectothermic species to court larger (and thus, more fecund) females. To test whether such preferences are dynamically adjusted to local conditions, we studied male preference for larger females in red-sided garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, near a communal den in Manitoba, Canada. Courting a small female imposes a high opportunity cost for a male in the centre of the den, because many large and easily located females are nearby. In the surrounding woodland, in contrast, a male that neglects a small female is unlikely to encounter a larger substitute partner. In arena trials, male snakes from the den selected larger females more than did males from the surrounding woodland. Manipulating a den male's exposure to females (none, large, small) for 60 min led males to adjust their criteria for courtship depending upon the sizes of females encountered. Hence, the local environment can modify courtship criteria, with male garter snakes adjusting their mate choice selectivity based upon spatial and temporal factors that affect the opportunity costs of courtship.

   COMPETITION; EXPERIENCE; AUTOTOMY; ARANEAE; COSTS; SIZE
AB Theory predicts that the outcome and escalation level of animal contests will reflect the contestants' expected payoffs as well as their relative fighting ability. Although an individual's future prospects of reproduction are expected to be critical for the risk of injury that it should accept when contesting a given resource, previous empirical work has ignored the possibility that this factor may differ between individuals. We studied male-male contests in the golden orb spider Nephila fenestrata, where the potential for future reproduction is much lower in mated than virgin males. Males typically mate with only one female in their lifetime, and are subsequently functionally sterile because of damage to their mating organs. Nevertheless, they guard their mate against rival males. This leads to a situation where mated males, having nothing to lose, are predicted to fight with maximal force when facing an intruder. In line with this prediction, mated males usually won contests against virgin males, even when the latter were physically superior. Staged contests between mated males resulted in high frequencies of injury. Our results show that constraints on future reproduction can be critical for understanding a species' contest behaviour.

AB We tested whether shiny cowbirds, Molothrus bonariensis, can improve the acquisition of a feeding response by observing a demonstrator of their own species or a species with which they share roosts and foraging flocks. We trained birds to peck a transilluminated response key using a classical conditioning procedure (the key was transilluminated for 10 s and then food was delivered to a hopper). We compared the efficiency in acquiring the pecking response in four experimental groups: (1) birds that could observe a conspecific demonstrator peck the key and then eat the food, (2) birds that could observe a heterospecific demonstrator (a screaming cowbird, Molothrus rufoaxillaris) peck the key and then eat the food, (3) birds that could observe the apparatus working automatically ('ghost' demonstrator) and (4) birds that learned the task alone. Birds in the conspecific demonstrator group required fewer trials to learn to peck the key than did birds in the groups with a ghost demonstrator or without a demonstrator. Birds in the group with a heterospecific demonstrator also required fewer trials to learn the task than did birds in the group without a demonstrator. There were no differences between the groups with a conspecific and a heterospecific demonstrator. Our results show that shiny cowbirds can acquire behaviour by observing other individuals, and that they learn from heterospecifics with which they share roosts and foraging flocks as readily as they do from conspecifics.

AB Trophically transmitted parasites may enhance their transmission by altering the phenotype of infected hosts to increase their vulnerability to predation by the next hosts in the life cycle. In an experimental study, we investigated whether the parasite Diplostomum spathaceum (Trematoda) alters cryptic coloration and cryptic behaviour of infected rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, so that they would be more conspicuous to avian predators. The parasite reduces the vision of fish by lodging in the eyes and inducing cataract formation, which gives it an opportunity to affect fish crypsis. We examined the effect of the parasite on the ability of fish to adjust their coloration to the environment and on the preference of fish for different backgrounds. When maintained against a black substrate coloration, the colour of both infected and control fish closely matched that of the environment. However, in lighter environments, the contrast between fish and background coloration increased, especially in infected fish, which were darker than control fish. Furthermore, when given a choice between black and white substrates, the preference of infected fish for the dark background, where the fish were least conspicuous, was reduced compared to that of controls. These results indicate that D. spathaceum eye flukes impair crypsis of fish which is one potential mechanism predisposing them to predation by bird hosts.

AB Contest duration in animals is often interpreted as being a consequence of mutual assessment of the difference in the competitors' resource-holding potential (RHP), allowing the inferior individual to avoid costly interactions it is likely to lose. Duration is thus predicted by the relative size of the competitors, and increases as the difference between them decreases. Alternatively, each individual may persist in accordance with thresholds determined by its own RHP, and weaker rivals retreat because they have lower thresholds. Contest duration depends on the RHP of the contestant that gives up first. Recent work suggests that even though duration is determined by the loser's size, this hypothesis also predicts a negative correlation between duration and the relative RHP of the contestants. However, it predicts (unlike the mutual assessment hypothesis) that contest duration should increase with the mean size of the contestants. We studied the determinants of fighting duration in the fiddler crab Uca mjoebergi. Fight duration increased with increasing size of the loser, and decreased, but to a lesser extent, with increasing size of the winner. Fights between size-matched individuals increased in duration with increasing mean size of the competitors. Neither the mutual assessment nor own-RHP-dependent persistence hypotheses can accurately explain the data. Instead, we present a modification of recent modelling work, and suggest that in U. mjoebergi individual cost thresholds may determine duration, but that larger opponents may inflict those costs more rapidly, consistent with the cumulative assessment game of animal conflict.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; TERRITORIAL DEFENSE; MATING SYSTEMS; WING COLOR;
   EVOLUTION; STRATEGIES; FLIGHT; SIZE
AB Visually cued mate location behaviour in insects such as butterflies is typically classified by 'wait or seek' dichotomies. Perching males adopt a sit-and-wait strategy at a particular spot rising to intercept passing females (which is often done in an aggressive territorial way), whereas patrolling males are permanently on the wing searching for females. The potential influence of changes in landscape caused by habitat fragmentation on mate location behaviour has only rarely been addressed. We investigated this behaviour among populations of the speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria, living in continuous woodland versus highly fragmented agricultural landscape with hedgerows and small patches of woodland. In the latter landscape males showed higher levels of aggressive fast take-offs (an indicator of territorial perching), but also higher levels of displacement (an indicator of patrolling). In an independent census, behaviour intermediate between perching and patrolling was much more frequent in the agricultural landscape than in the woodland landscape. Our results suggest that the dichotomy of perching versus patrolling as typically observed in woodland fades away in highly fragmented agricultural landscape. We discuss our results in relation to differences in densities and thermal properties of both types of landscape.

AB Teaching is an altruistic act. Therefore, it is most likely to occur when pupil and teacher are closely related, costs to teachers of teaching are small, and benefits to pupils of being taught are large. Here, we determined, first, whether Rattus novegicus dams would modify their food choices to teach their young which of two foods was safe to eat, and second, whether such teaching by mothers would be effective, if it occurred. We examined food choices of rat dams trained to eat one of two foods that their young could access when the dams could also access a third, more palatable food that their pups could not reach (three-bowl condition). These dams spent no more time eating the safe food available to their young than did control dams, which had access to the same three foods, but were not trained to avoid one of the two foods available to their young. Thus, dams that had learned that a food available to their offspring was toxic, failed to act to protect their young. When dams were trained to avoid one of only two foods available to them and their young (two-bowl condition), the young avoided the food that their dam had learned to avoid longer than did young of dams in the three-bowl condition. Thus, young of dams in the three-bowl condition would have been less likely to eat toxic food if their dams had behaved appropriately. The present paradigm, though providing no evidence of teaching by rat dams, should permit investigation of teaching in many vertebrate species.

AB Swordtail fish have been studied extensively in relation to several exaggerated male traits that have evolved due to sexual selection. However, one species of swordtail fish, Xiphophorus continens, lacks all of these traits. Males in this species are relatively small, lack swords and do not possess any of the pigment patterns found throughout the swordtails and platyfish. In this study we compared the mating behaviour of X. continens to the mating behaviours of other swordtail fish to determine whether a relaxation of sexual selection may have played a role in the loss of large male size and the pigment pattern vertical bars. We found that X. continens lacked the courtship behaviours present in other swordtail species, and that female mating preference for male size and male response to the pigment pattern vertical bars were significantly weaker than in other swordtails we have tested. In addition, results of staged male-male interactions suggested that neither male size nor vertical bars are under strong selection due to male-male competition. However, we did detect a polymorphism in female preference for vertical bars, suggesting that the response of female X. continens to vertical bars has been evolutionarily retained even though the trait was lost. Based on what is known about female preference for body size and bars, and male response to body size and bars across the northern swordtails, we hypothesize that the loss of large male size was due to a relaxation of sexual selection, whereas the loss of vertical bars was not.

AB Is a male's ability to find fertilizable females an important determinant of his mating success? We exploited unique logistical advantages offered by courting aggregations of garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, in Manitoba, Canada, to ask: (1) does the order at which a male arrives at a solitary female affect either his courtship tactics or his chances of inseminating her; and (2) does a male's body size affect his probability of arriving before his rivals? Experimental trials in the field and in outdoor arenas (to control group size and arrival intervals) suggested that, in the area near the main den, being the first to find a solitary female conveys limited or no fitness benefits to a male snake. Other males were likely to arrive before the male could achieve copulation; and early arrival did not guarantee optimal positioning within the mating ball. Thus, late-arriving males were as likely to obtain copulations as were early arrivers. Male body size enhanced mating success more in early arrivers than latecomers, but did not affect arrival times. However, although mate-finding ability was unimportant for male garter snakes competing near the den, it was critical in surrounding woodland where densities of rivals were much lower.

AB Much of the research on learning in fruit flies has focused on the genetic and cellular basis of learning. The evolutionary relevance of learning in these tiny, short-lived insects is not well understood. Relying on the knowledge that male fruit flies learn in the context of courtship, I tested whether such learning improves male courtship. I found, first, that compared with inexperienced males, males with experience courting recently mated, unreceptive females were slower to begin courtship of novel recently mated females and spent less time courting such females. The experienced males, however, began courting virgin females sooner than did inexperienced males and courted such females as long as did inexperienced males. Second, compared with males experienced with recently mated females, males experienced with immature, unreceptive females were faster to approach either virgin or recently mated females and courted virgin females longer. These results indicate that courting experience permits male fruit flies to refine their courtship behaviour in a way that could increase their mating success.

AB We compared the feeding performance and overt aggressive behaviour of two closely related salmonids occupying the same food patches. Foraging competition between pairs of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, and brown trout, Salmo trutta, in which trout were the larger and predicted to be the more dominant species, was investigated in a controlled stream channel environment. Trout held station by swimming actively in the central regions of food patches, whereas salmon occupied the margins, generally remaining stationary on the stream bed. There was little overt aggression, but the direction of attacks was consistent, with trout being dominant over salmon. Trout made significantly more foraging attempts (61.4% of food items presented) than salmon (28.9%). However, efficiency of food capture was higher in salmon (97%) than in trout (78%) and there was no significant difference between species in food intake. Salmon fed by briefly invading the space occupied for most of the time by trout. This behaviour has similarities to the 'sneaky' behaviours often shown by subordinate male salmonids during spawning, when gametes rather than food are the contested resource.

AB Pollinators often sequentially visit one flower type while bypassing other equally rewarding flower types in the process. Many explanations for this pattern of flower choice in pollinators, known as flower constancy, have been proposed; yet, a sufficient answer to the question of why pollinators are constant still remains elusive. We tested the hypothesis that flower constancy in pollinators is related to the number of traits distinguishing available flowers by measuring the floral selectivity (both constancy and preference) of bumblebees, Bombus impatiens, when artificial flower types differed in either colour only (variation in a single trait) or colour and other floral traits (variation in multiple traits). As expected, bees showed increased degrees of selectivity (constancy and preference) when available flower types differed in colour and other floral traits compared with when available flower types differed in colour only. In addition, bee foraging rates (measured in flowers visited per min) varied inversely with the number of variable floral traits added to colour but not with the number of colours. Together, these results are consistent with the idea that the mechanism underlying flower constancy in bumblebees is a limitation on their ability to effectively search for and/or remember multiple combinations of floral traits at the same time. We discuss the roles of floral-trait variation, flower constancy and pollinator cognitive limitations in the coevolution of flowering plants and their animal pollinators.

AB Precocial offspring are often required to recognize and acquire food without assistance. In addition, they must be able to respond to changes in prey availability. We studied two species of cray-fish snake (Regina septemvittata and R. grahamii) to compare the effect of the availability of their preferred prey, freshly moulted crayfish, on the ontogeny of chemosensory response towards different prey types (fish, odonate larvae, intermoult crayfish and freshly moulted crayfish). A split litter design was used; within each species, litters were divided into three groups for testing at different ages (7, 14 and 21 days) and then within each age group, individuals were assigned to treatment groups that were fed or not fed prior to testing. The results of this study confirm that R. grahamii and R. septemvittata are born with chemosensory prey preferences that reflect their specialized diets. However, the ontogeny of these preferences is modified by food availability and available energy levels. Significantly, the pattern of development that emerged in the groups deprived of food differed between species. Regina septemvittata neonates had limited yolk and fat reserves and rapidly increased their interest in alternative prey types, whereas R. grahamii neonates, with significantly more reserves, did not increase their responses to alternative preys These differences may reflect alternative survival strategies of newborn snakes that have different amounts of energy reserves at birth.

AB The social complexity hypothesis posits that natural selection has favoured the evolution of intelligence in animals living in challenging social environments. Although several primate species have been shown to use information about the social relationships between conspecifics in activities such as recruiting allies or reconciling after fights, this ability to recognize third-party relationships has never been demonstrated in nonprimate mammals. However, the social complexity hypothesis predicts that nonprimates should show some of the same cognitive abilities as primates when many features of their social lives resemble those of primates. Here we tested this prediction with data from a group of free-living spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, which are gregarious carnivores that live in primate-like societies. First, we examined whether hyaenas consistently supported dominant animals over subordinates when they joined in dyadic fights. The hyaenas overwhelmingly supported the dominant animal in each fight, even when both fighting animals ranked below the supporter, and even when the dominant individual was losing the fight. Next, we examined whether hyaenas preferentially attacked relatives of their opponents after a fight. We found that they were more likely to attack relatives of their opponents after a fight than during a control period, and that they were also more likely to attack relatives of their opponents than to at-tack low-ranking animals unrelated to their opponents. These results suggest that hyaenas can recognize third-party relationships, and support the idea that social complexity drives the evolution of intelligence in phylogenetically disparate taxa.

AB Male song sparrows sing repertoires of 4-13 distinct song types and have proved a valuable model for testing hypotheses concerning the function and evolution of song complexity. Captive female song sparrows solicit more copulations in response to playback of larger repertoires, yet it remains unclear whether male repertoire size influences female mate choice in natural situations. We used long-term data from free-living song sparrows inhabiting Mandarte Island, British Columbia, Canada, to investigate whether male song repertoire size predicted three components of reproductive performance during the first year: territory acquisition, mating success and laying date. Across males whose song was recorded, males with larger repertoires were not more likely to acquire a territory, to acquire a larger territory or to settle sooner. However, after we controlled for territory size and between-year variation in the population sex ratio, first-year males with larger repertoires were more likely to mate. This was because they were more likely to pair with newly settled females, not because they were more likely to acquire territories where older females were already resident. After we controlled for territory size and between-year variation in breeding date, newly settled females laid earlier when mated with males with larger repertoires. Together with the results of previous mate choice experiments, these patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that male song repertoire size is a sexually selected trait that influences female mate choice in song sparrows.

AB Socially learned vocalizations, such as the songs of many songbirds, commonly show repertoires and geographical variation or dialects, but we have only a limited understanding of the cultural evolutionary processes that produce these patterns. In this paper we describe the singing behaviour of populations of black-capped chickadees in Fort Collins, Colorado that represents the apparent evolution of a repertoire of song types. In contrast to most black-capped chickadee singing behaviour, which consists of a single song type that is remarkably invariant across North America, chickadees throughout Fort Collins sing three acoustically distinct song types. Individual males have an average repertoire of 2.8 song types and use all of them in dawn bouts and countersinging with neighbouring males. Two of the three song types contain novel introductory notes. These notes and the ratio between the pitches of the two whistled notes used in the song consistently define each song type. Individual birds slightly vary the pitches used during a bout of singing for a particular song type but always maintain a constant pitch ratio for that type. The song type repertoire appears to be restricted to the Fort Collins area and has persisted for several years. We outline some of the cultural evolutionary processes that may have produced this repertoire and conclude by discussing research opportunities that may yield insight into how and why socially learned traditions originate and evolve.

AB We used radiotelemetry to quantify roost switching and assess associations between members of maternity colonies of forest-dwelling big brown bats. Bats remained loyal to small roosting areas of forest within and between years and switched trees often ((X) over bar +/- SD = 1.7 +/- 0.7 days). For radiotagged bats from the colony in one of these areas, roost-switching frequency was positively correlated with the number of different individuals with which tagged bats shared roosts. We quantified associations between pairs of bats using a pairwise sharing index and found that bats associated more often than predicted when roost and roostmate selection were random but that all tagged bats spent at least some days roosting in different trees, apart from preferred roostmates. Our results suggest that forest-dwelling big brown bats conform to a fission-fusion roosting pattern. Roost switching in forests may reflect the maintenance of long-term social relationships between individuals from a colony that is spread among a number of different trees on a given night. In this fission-fusion scenario, switching between trees, within a local area, could serve to increase the numbers of individuals with which bats maintain associations. We contend that roosting areas in forests are analogous to spatially large roosts in caves, mines and buildings. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We tested the hypothesis that dispersal and philopatry are components of a mixed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). The hypothesis predicts that fitness of dispersers should be equal to that of philopatric individuals. Alternatively, fitness of dispersers could be lower (the resident fitness hypothesis) or greater (the cost of dispersal hypothesis) than that of philopatric individuals. We compared fitness of individuals that moved to new habitats (emigrants) and those that remained within habitat boundaries (residents) in populations of the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster, and the meadow vole, M. pennsylvanicus. We established vole populations in four enclosures (66 X 78 m). Within each enclosure, voles were free to move between four types of habitats that varied in the availability of supplemental food and the amount of vegetative cover. We analysed two fitness components: the survival rates of all individuals, and pregnancy rates of females. Our study showed that emigrants generally had greater fitness than residents and that the difference in fitness was habitat dependent (i.e. was greater when individuals were emigrating from low-quality habitats than from high-quality habitats). High-food, high-cover habitats were the only habitat types for which fitness of emigrants was lower than that of residents. Similar patterns occurred in both prairie voles and meadow voles. Our results support the cost of dispersal hypothesis. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Optimality theory of sex allocation in structured populations has proved remarkably successful in explaining patterns of facultative sex ratio behaviour in numerous species. Extensions to the basic theory have included more specific aspects of species biology, including the relatedness of interacting individuals. We considered the sex ratio decisions made by female Nasonia vitripennis wasps when they were ovipositing on a patch with either relatives or nonrelatives. Theory predicts that females should produce more female-biased sex ratios when ovipositing with relatives, for example sisters, than with unrelated females. This is because related females should limit the level of local mate competition between their sons for female partners. Contrary to theory, two experiments showed that female sex ratio behaviour was unaffected by the relatedness of their oviposition partner, and was also unrelated to an environmental cue that could signal relatedness, i.e. whether females responded differently to sisters emerging from the same or a different host. Instead, in both experiments, we found that only wasp strain significantly influenced sex ratio. A meta-analysis of studies conducted on a range of species on the effects of the relatedness of oviposition partners on sex ratio failed to show the predicted pattern. We discuss why females appear to behave in a maladaptive way when allocating sex under these conditions, and suggest that weak selection and/or conflict between females over optimal sex ratios may influence the evolution of kin discrimination.

AB Recently we proposed that early feather pecking is a form of social exploration. Social recognition, important for exploration, is a lateralized function in the domestic chick. Lateralization of functions can be influenced by light exposure late in embryonic development. Therefore, we investigated whether this light exposure affected early posthatching feather-pecking behaviour in domestic chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus. White leghorn embryos either were exposed to light or remained in darkness in the last week of incubation. After hatching, they were housed in groups of two light-exposed and two dark-incubated chicks. Light-exposed chicks showed more feather pecking than did their dark-incubated cagemates. Dark-incubated chicks preferred to direct feather pecks to unfamiliar peers than to familiar peers; light-exposed chicks showed no preference. These effects were present in the first week after hatching and remained at least another 3 weeks. These results support the hypothesis that early gentle feather pecking is part of the normal behavioural repertoire of young chicks and influences social exploration. We discuss a possible mechanism underlying these results. We also suggest that it may be worthwhile not to expose embryos to light during the last week of incubation when housing hatchlings in commercial conditions, where feather pecking is a serious problem.

AB Male dispersal from the birth group is common in the majority of social mammals, and in many species, males also engage in secondary or breeding dispersal following natal emigration. However, the patterns and causes of secondary dispersal are poorly understood due to the difficulty in following emigrants. Here, we detail the patterns and causation of male secondary dispersal in several groups of white-faced capuchins observed between 1985 and 2000 in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. Subsequent to natal emigration, which occurs between 2 and 8 years of age (median 4.5 years), male white-faced capuchins embark on a life of continual movement. Although males of all age classes engage in voluntary secondary dispersal, the ways by which males enter groups varies according to their age class. Adult males (greater than or equal to10 years old) are more likely to enter groups aggressively, and they display longer tenure than either subadult males (7-10 years of age) or juvenile males (1-7 years of age). Given our finding that adult males face the highest risks in terms of aggressive interactions with conspecifics, we examined several explanations as to why they continue to disperse throughout their lives. Our data best support the intragroup mating competition hypothesis for secondary dispersal, whereby males move frequently between groups as a means of increasing their reproductive opportunities. Males may also engage in frequent secondary dispersal to avoid mating with their maturing daughters, although this hypothesis was not strongly supported by the current data. Males of all age classes displayed very high levels of parallel dispersal, which probably serves to offset the high costs of dispersal (predation, starvation and/or aggression from conspecifics) and it may also serve as a means of retaining kinship among group males.

ID EUROPEAN BADGER; ORGANIZATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Eurasian badgers sometimes live in territorial, mixed-sex groups; the adaptive significance of this is not understood, but members generally interact amicably. None the less, badgers occasionally fight and inflict sometimes severe wounds on one another. Based on 498 badger life histories, from first emergence as a cub until death, documented during a 10-year trapping study at Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, U.K., the patterns and rates of bite wounding and consequential scarring were examined. Male badgers received more wounds and more severe wounds than did females. Wounding rates for both sexes increased significantly with age, and there was evidence that heavier individuals received most wounds. No seasonal pattern in wounding rates was apparent. During the study, the badger population size increased three-fold and wounding rates, particularly in males, showed a density-dependent increase. The rate of bite wounding increased with group size, and this increase was more marked among males than among females. Among males, but not females, the rate of bite wounding also increased with the number of badgers living in adjoining territories. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many orb-web weaving spiders add conspicuous silken structures, called stabilimenta, to the hub of their webs, which are hypothesized to attract more prey. However, they may also attract predators. Orb spiders should therefore alter their web-building behaviour to minimize predation risk. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally examining web-building responses of the St Andrew cross spider, Argiope versicolor, to predation risk from one of its natural predators, the jumping spider Portia labiata. We randomly assigned A. versicolor juveniles to one of three treatments: (1) blank control (clean blotting paper: no odour from the predator or nonpredator); (2) predator odour cues from P. labiata; and (3) nonpredator control (odour cues from Leucauge decorata). Each individual of A. versicolor was monitored until it had built five consecutive webs (two webs before and three webs after the introduction of predator cues). When exposed to predator cues, the juveniles not only decreased the frequency of stabilimentum building but also refrained from increasing stabilimentum area, capture area and capture silk thread with subsequent webs compared with the blank control and the nonpredator control. Web-building traits, however, were not significantly different between the blank control and the nonpredator control. One plausible explanation is that A. versicolor juveniles can detect and discriminate between predators and nonpredators through olfactory cues and alter stabilimentum building and other web traits in response to the risk of predation. This is the first demonstration of an adaptive, plastic web-building behavioural response induced by chemical cues from a predator. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB At around day 11 of life, domestic chicks show a tendency to move out of sight of their mother before returning and regaining social and visual contact. We conducted a series of experiments to investigate the role of this voluntary 'out-of-sight' behaviour on the development of spatial memory in young chicks. We compared the behaviour of chicks that were reared in environments that provided opportunities to move out of sight of an imprinting stimulus (occlusion-experienced chicks) with the behaviour of chicks that were given minimal occlusion experience (controls). As in natural conditions, out-of-sight behaviour peaked on day 11. When chicks were released into larger pens at 14 days of age, occlusion-experienced chicks walked more than control chicks, but otherwise showed similar degrees of dispersal. Occlusion-experienced chicks tended to show better (although not significant, P = 0.09) retrieval of a visually displaced imprinting stimulus than control chicks. Time spent out of sight in the rearing pens was negatively related to the number of orientation errors in a detour test. Occlusion-experienced chicks also tended to make fewer orientation errors in the first trial (P = 0.07) and in subsequent trials (P = 0.05). In contrast, experimentally manipulating the amount of time that chicks were out of sight of an imprinting stimulus (by confining the chicks) had no effect on their performance in displacement or detour tests. The results presented here suggest that active experience of occlusion around day 11 improved egocentric orientation towards an out-of-sight goal, supporting the hypothesis that enrichment-induced behavioural changes are dependent on the interaction with objects.

ID FITNESS CONSEQUENCES; DECEPTION; SELECTION; SIGNALS
AB When animals lack the ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect information, they must choose to either respond to or ignore an information source. I define the reliability of information as the probability that information is correct and introduce reliability into the value of information to explore the level of risk information consumers should incur when using information. I find that when information consumers do not control the reliability of information, they should be more discriminating as the benefit of correct information declines, as the cost of misinformation increases and when acquisition costs are greater. However, when consumers pay for reliability, I find that consumers should be more discriminating as the benefit of correct information increases, the cost of misinformation increases, and when acquisition is cheaper. Application of this theory suggests that: (1) selection for individual recognition should be stronger when the cost of misinformation (deception) is high; (2) mimics can outnumber models when models are very noxious or alternative prey are abundant; and (3) memory about predators should be longer than memory about prey.

AB Orientation by an animal inhabiting an underground environment must be extremely efficient if it is to contend effectively with the high energetic costs of excavating soil for a tunnel system. We examined, in the field, the ability of a fossorial rodent, the blind mole-rat, Spalax ehrenberyi, to detour different types of obstacles blocking its tunnel and rejoin the disconnected tunnel section. To create obstacles, we dug ditches, which we either left open or filled with stone or wood. Most (77%) mole-rats reconnected the two parts of their tunnel and accurately returned to their orginal path by digging a parallel bypass tunnel around the obstacle at a distance of 10-20 cm from the open ditch boundaries or 3-8 cm from the filled ditch boundaries. When the ditch was placed asymmetrically across the tunnel, the mole-rats detoured around the shorter side. These findings demonstrate that mole-rats seem to be able to assess the nature of an obstacle ahead and their own distance from the obstacle boundaries, as well as the relative location of the far section of disconnected tunnel. We suggest that mole-rats mainly use reverberating self-produced seismic vibrations as a mechanism to determine the size, nature and location of the obstacle, as well as internal self-generated references to determine their location relative to the disconnected tunnel section.

AB We investigated how the distance between foods of differing nutrient content affects macronutrient (protein and digestible carbohydrate) regulation and the patterns of food acquisition, movement and feeding activity in fifth-instar nymphs of Locusta migratoria (L.) (Orthoptera: Acrididae). We placed individual insects into one of three differently sized circular arenas (20, 40 or 80 cm diameter) that contained four dishes of chemically defined synthetic food. One of these dishes contained high-protein, low-carbohydrate food (P), and the other three dishes contained low-protein, high-carbohydrate food (C). Alone, these foods are nutritionally unbalanced, but together they are complementary. Regardless of arena size, locusts regulated their protein-carbohydrate intake to similar points, and in all three arenas they ate preferentially from the dish containing the P-food. We also recorded the patterns of foraging behaviour for 12 h on days 1 and 4 of the experiment, which allowed us to determine the effect of distance between foods and whether behaviour was modified with experience in the different arenas. Locusts' foraging behaviour in small arenas was similar on days 1 and 4, and the time they spent in different parts of the arena did not differ from that predicted by the simplest random probability model. In contrast, the foraging behaviour of locusts in the medium and large arenas changed between days 1 and 4, including spending more time in the area of the arena containing the P-food and visiting fewer of the C-food dishes. We discuss how distance between foods influences foraging strategies, and the possible role of learning in its development. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Colour polymorphisms can be maintained in a population if all morphs have equal fitness on average, if fitness is frequency dependent or if fitness functions cross for some environmental or social variable. We studied female-limited colour polymorphism in the Rambur's forktail damselfly, Ischnura ramburi, in which one female morph looks like the male. The most commonly cited hypotheses to explain this polymorphism involve an advantage to andromorphs of avoiding costly matings through male mimicry. An alternative hypothesis argues that males learn the most common morph and that the polymorphism is maintained by a rare-morph advantage of mating avoidance, irrespective of male mimicry. We tested predictions of the male mimicry hypothesis, learned mate recognition hypothesis (LMR) and two new hypotheses. We used censuses and a mark-resight study to estimate density, sex ratio, morph frequency and mating frequencies. We observed interactions to test for male mimicry and female competition and to evaluate the frequency of mating attempts. Andromorphs were less likely than gynomorphs to receive mating attempts in encounters with males, but did not mate less frequently, or attack males or interrupt oviposition by other females more frequently. Contrary to the LMR hypothesis, the rarer morph was more likely to receive mating attempts. Andromorph frequency was greater in older females than in younger females, suggesting higher mortality or dispersal of gynomorphs. Our results support a modification of the male mimicry hypothesis, the signal detection hypothesis. Together with past studies, our results suggest that the female morphs may be alternative mating avoidance strategies. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study ofAnimal Behaviour.

AB When females mate multiple times it presents an intriguing problem for evolutionary biologists due to the high costs and not very apparent benefits. Yet, this behaviour must have higher benefits than costs to be maintained by natural selection. We studied possible benefits for multiple mating by female leaf beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, both with multiple males (polyandry) and multiple times with the same male (repeated matings). For polyandry, we tested the material benefits hypothesis, as well as fertility insurance, by mating females to varying numbers of males and looking at sperm received and fecundity. Although there was a relationship between amount of stored sperm and number of matings, we did not find the predicted positive relationship between fecundity and number of matings. Thus, the material benefits hypothesis was not supported. For repeated matings, we tested the sperm and nonsperm material benefit hypotheses by mating females to a single male varying numbers of times on one mount. For this set of tests neither sperm number nor fecundity was positively correlated with number of matings, therefore neither hypothesis was supported. Interestingly, in both experiments, there was a significant decrease in hatch rate with an increase in matings, demonstrating a cost of polyandry. These findings, along with previous research, suggest a cost of multiple mating with a possible role of seminal fluids in the reduction in female fecundity.

AB For small mammals that are vulnerable to predation, the protection provided by physical structuring within the habitat is important in determining suitable nest or resting sites but little is known about how different aspects of structure affect use of the habitat more generally. We examined the effects of ground-level structure (open/complex), overhead cover (present/absent) and the distribution of protected nest sites and food (clumped together/scattered) on activity and use of space among house mice, Mus domesticus, in enclosures. Adult pairs were housed in eight habitat types differing in arrangement of nestboxes, bricks and cover sheets, and their location was monitored under infrared light every 0.5 s over 4 h during the dark period. The mice spent much more time within protected nest sites and were more restricted in use of different sites within habitats that had little ground-level structure and no overhead cover. Much wider use was made of structurally complex habitats. Complex ground-level structure had the greatest impact on emergence from protected nest sites and use of space, since mice preferred to stay close to, or on top of, walls and other objects when undisturbed. The influence of overhead cover on normal activity depended on the extent of ground-level structure and origin of the mice, but, when disturbed by an experimenter, mice sheltered under overhead cover or in enclosed nest sites. Preference between nest sites depended on accessibility from under overhead cover and proximity to enclosure walls. We found almost no sex differences in activity or use of space.

AB The forces responsible for maintaining genetic polymorphisms within populations are often unclear. Male pygmy swordtails are polymorphic at a single Y-linked locus that regulates body colour. The visually conspicuous, sex-limited polymorphism suggests that sexual selection is important for maintaining genetic variation for these conspicuous phenotypes. We performed a series of behavioural experiments that decoupled body colour from possible correlates, to detect female mating preferences for each morph and differences in male reproductive behaviour. Male body colour, male mating behaviour and male agonistic behaviour all appeared to influence male reproductive success. Females in two of three populations showed mating preferences for blue males, but gold males dominated in agonistic interactions and were more aggressive in pursuing females. Females in those populations preferred blue to gold males under optical filters that masked blue colour, but not under filters that masked gold colour, suggesting that female behaviour reflects an aversion to gold males. Females from one population characterized by high predation risk, the Nacimiento of the Rio Huichihuayan, Mexico, showed no mating preferences for blue males, a significantly different result from those for females from two populations with a lower predation risk. Both female mating preferences and male competitive behaviour thus appeared to be important for maintaining the colour polymorphism. The lack of preference in the Nacimiento population is consistent with previous studies showing reduced preferences for conspicuous traits in this population.

AB Studies on avian navigation began at the end of the 19th century with testing various hypotheses, followed by large-scale displacement experiments to assess the capacity of the birds' navigational abilities. In the 1950s, the first theoretical concepts were published. Kramer proposed his 'Map-and-Compass' model, assuming that birds establish the direction to a distant goal with the help of an external reference, a compass. The model describes homing as a two-step process, with the first step determining the direction to the goal as a compass course and the second step locating this course with the help of a compass. This model was widely accepted when numerous experiments with clock-shifted pigeons demonstrated the use of the sun compass, and thus a general involvement of compass orientation, in homing. The 'map' step is assumed to use local site-specific information, which led to the idea of a 'grid map' based on environmental gradients. Kramer's model still forms the basis of our present concept on avian homing, yet route integration with the help of an external reference provides an alternative strategy to determine the home course, and the magnetic compass is a second compass mechanism available to birds. These mechanisms are interrelated by ontogenetic learning processes. A two-step process, with the first step providing the compass course and the second step locating this course with the help of a compass, appears to be a common feature of avian navigation tasks, yet the origin of the compass courses differs between tasks according to their nature, with courses acquired by experience for flights within the home range, courses based on navigational processes for returning home, and courses derived from genetically coded information in first-time migrants. Compass orientation thus forms the backbone of the avian navigational system. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The production of learned vocalizations such as in birdsong is often used to judge whether stimuli had been memorized upon their presentation. However, failures in the imitation of certain song patterns may also reflect impaired development of motor programmes or impaired memory retrieval rather than failures in stimulus memorization during auditory acquisition. To study this issue, we confronted adult hand-reared nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos, with interactive playback experiments and used vocal matching as a behavioural tool to investigate their song type memories. Vocal matching is a common pattern-specific response that songbirds use in territorial countersinging. We distinguished two forms of pattern-specific matching: (1) song type matching (i.e. a bird replied with the same song type as the stimulus song), and (2) song group matching (i.e. the bird replied with a different song type which was, however, sequentially associated with the playback song presented earlier, i.e. during the tutoring). Some subjects used both song type and song group matching in response to song types they had not imitated from the tutor programme prior to the playback experiments. Our results indicate that nightingales store more song types in their sensory phase than they spontaneously recall from memory as adults. That is, memories of song types that were not performed in overt behaviour could be activated by vocal interactions, here induced by the interactive playback.

AB We tested the effects of larval and preforaging rearing environment on the foraging behaviour and sucrose response thresholds of honeybees, Apis mellifera L., derived from high and low pollen-hoarding strains. Bees were reared as larvae and as preforaging adults in colonies containing high and low pollen-hoarding strains, then cofostered in unrelated common wild-type colonies from which to forage. Genotype, but not rearing environment, had strong effects on the likelihood to forage for pollen or nectar, the size of pollen or nectar load, and the concentration of sugar in the nectar they collected. Genotype and rearing environment affected adult wet weights and sucrose concentration response threshold, as measured with the proboscis extension response assay. Bees from the high pollen-hoarding strain were more sensitive to conditions of the rearing environment than were bees of the low strain. High- and low-strain bees produced different colony environments that affected developmental, behavioural and physical traits of the individuals they reared. This demonstrates how genotype and colony environment correlate and affect phenotype. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Previous phonotaxis studies with two species of the Physalaemus pustulosus species group indicated that female preferences for several heterospecific call traits resulted from sensory biases inherited from a common ancestor. In phonotaxis experiments, we determined whether Physalaemus enesefae, a distant relative of the P. pustulosus group, showed similar preferences for call traits not present in conspecific males. We presented females with a choice between the typical conspecific advertisement call and the same call to which we digitally appended a chuck from P. pustulosus, a squawk from P. freibergi, and an amplitude-modulated prefix from P. pustulatus. In addition we presented the advertisement call in doublets, a trait peculiar to P. coloradorum. We also analysed male vocal behaviour evoked in response to the same suite of stimuli. Physalaemus enesefae females did not prefer the calls of their own males with, appended heterospecific traits over unmodified calls, nor conspecific calls in doublets over single calls. The lack of preference among females was not the result of a behavioural polymorphism. Female responses to repeated presentations of the same stimulus pair were not consistent. Males also did not show an enhanced vocal response to altered calls relative to the typical conspecific call. Consequently, there are no pre-existing biases for these heterospecific call traits in P. enesefae; pre-existing preferences in the P. pustulosus group could have been inherited from an ancestor not shared with P. enesefae, but data from other closely related species are needed to confirm this conclusion.

AB Mink offspring from two genetic lines, selected over 10 generations for confident (C) or fearful (F) reaction towards humans, were exposed to six different tests. The aim was to investigate whether this behavioural selection in mink has affected their reaction in other potentially fear-eliciting situations. A total of 192 naive mink, males and females, were tested over 6 weeks. C-mink had a shorter latency to get near and establish exploratory contact with a human than F-mink. F-mink maintained 6-10 times the distance to a human than C-mink. Similarly, C-mink had a markedly shorter latency than F-mink to approach and make contact with a novel object. C-mink also manipulated the object sooner and more often. In encounters with unfamiliar mink, C-mink were quicker to approach and establish nonaggressive contact than F-mink. C-mink had a shorter latency than F-mink to enter tubes within an X maze, and were more likely to visit these tubes. In contrast, F-mink made the most visits to other parts of the maze; number of visits may not, however, reflect just exploration. When presented with novel food, F-mink changed their behaviour more often than C-mink, indicating a higher degree of behavioural conflict. C-mink were also less hesitant than F-mink to approach and eat the novel food. In conclusion, offspring from a confident breeding line reacted with more exploratory behaviour than offspring from a fearful breeding line. Mink lines selected for behaviour towards humans thus generalized their fear responses across several social and nonsocial situations. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The timing and extent of early exposure to conspecific song can have critical influence on subsequent male vocal development in songbirds. Opportunities to memorize local song models may vary among populations depending on local ecological conditions that determine the length of the breeding season. In populations with comparatively short breeding seasons, such as northern or high-elevation populations, restricted access to local songs may delay development in a large proportion of juveniles. Previous studies have described extreme examples of delayed development in high-elevation populations of brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus titer, in the Sierra Nevada of California, U.S.A. In the current study, we determined that delayed development also occurs in a low-elevation population located at a more northerly latitude than those in the Sierra. We recorded two kinds of songs from yearling and adult males who had been given testosterone (testosterone increased song output but did not change the nature of songs in males' repertoires) soon after being trapped at two adjacent sites in New York state, U.S.A. The average size of 'perched' song repertoires of 17 yearlings was significantly smaller than that of 20 local adults (2.8 versus 4.6 types, respectively) and yearlings generally lacked the shared songs typically found in adult repertoires. Only 40% of yearlings trapped at one site produced the correct local dialect 'flight whistle' compared with 91.7% of adults. These results strongly suggest that juvenile access to local songs is also restricted in this population and that delayed vocal development is widespread in cowbirds. In addition, these findings indicate that reliance on field recordings may underestimate adult-yearling differences in vocal competency in cowbirds because yearlings that sing readily in nature may not be representative of yearlings in general, a result that may also apply to other songbird species. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Syntactic rules allow a speaker to combine signals with existing meanings to create an infinite number of new meanings. Even though combinatory rules have also been found in some animal communication systems, they have never been clearly linked to concurrent changes in meaning. The present field experiment indicates that wild Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana, may comprehend the semantic changes caused by a combinatory rule present in the natural communication of another primate, the Campbell's monkey, C. campbelli. Campbell's males give acoustically distinct alarm calls to leopards, Panthera pardus, and crowned-hawk eagles, Stephanoaetus coronatus, and Diana monkeys respond to these calls with their own corresponding alarm calls. However, in less dangerous situations, Campbell's males emit a pair of low, resounding 'boom' calls before their alarm calls. Playbacks of boom-introduced Campbell's alarm calls no longer elicited alarm calls in Diana monkeys, indicating that the booms have affected the semantic specificity of the subsequent alarm calls. When the booms preceded the alarm calls of Diana monkeys, however, they were no longer effective as semantic modifiers, indicating that they are meaningful only in conjunction with Campbell's alarm calls. I discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of syntactic abilities. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Uncertainty in partner recognition and the tail-up display in a
   monogamous butterflyfish
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; FISH; EVOLUTION
AB Many monogamous birds and fish perform displays towards mates that are either identical or very similar to threat displays. Uncertainty in partner recognition may be a key to explaining this behaviour in the monogamous butterflyfish Chaetodon lunulatus. From a causal perspective, when partner recognition is uncertain, the butterflyfish may follow the same decision rules as in territorial interactions with nonpartners. From this hypothesis, I derived three predictions of the frequencies of social behaviours, that is, solo displays, mutual displays, attacks and rejoinings. If the frequencies are S, M, A and R, respectively, the predictions are that (1) M/(M+A) and M(M+S) should be higher in rejoining situations than in a pair-swimming situation; (2) (M+S)/R and (M+A)/R should increase with the duration of separation; and (3) M/(M+A) should be larger than M/(M+S). To test the predictions, I made field observations. The results supported all of these predictions. Therefore, I suggest that uncertainty of partner recognition causes the butterflyfish to perform the tail-up display, which is usually used in territorial interactions, towards the partner. From a functional perspective, this hypothesis implies that the display serves to reduce the risk of failure to recognize a partner, which could result in an attack. The display causes the conspecific to hesitate before attacking, providing sufficient time for partner recognition. Field data indicated that more than 70% of dangerous attacks were prevented by a tail-up display. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Gorilla, Gorilla gorilla, females associate permanently with males. What benefit do the females obtain from the association? Where males are larger than females, as in the gorilla, protection from predation is the long-standing answer. However, protection from infanticidal nonfather males is increasingly suggested as a better hypothesis. Given that a female's alternative strategy is to range alone and mate with many males, a hitherto ignored problem of the anti-infanticide hypothesis is that a female's joining a single male necessarily maximizes the proportion of males in the population who can use the infanticidal strategy. To ask whether lone gorilla females could mate with enough males to decrease the probability of infanticide below that observed in the wild, we use novel modifications of a gas molecule equation to model encounter rates of a lone female with males. The modifications include separation of encounter rates in fertile periods from those in nursing periods and, importantly, a decline function that converts infanticidal males to noninfanticidal, on mating. Parameters include density of males, speed of travel, and duration of fertile and nursing periods. In two other great apes (chimpanzee Pan, orang-utan Pongo), females are more or less solitary, and infanticide rates are very low (less than or equal to5%). With these species' values in the model, equivalently low infanticide rates result. Thus, the model appears valid. For the gorilla, the model indicates that under most realistic conditions, solitary females mate with so few males that infanticide rates are more than three times the observed rate of 14% of births. Association with a male thus decreases the probability of infanticide. The anti-infanticide hypothesis for grouping is thus supported. But the antipredation hypothesis is not thereby negated, and remains a powerful hypothesis, given that predators are a danger to the female, as well as her infant.

AB Previous studies have demonstrated that adult male red-spotted newts, Notophthalmus viridescens, are attracted to female sexual pheromones and avoid conspecific alarm substances that signal predation. In this study, we tested the response of red-spotted newts to different concentrations and combinations of macerated male newt extract (MNE) and gravid female odour in the laboratory and field. In the laboratory, mates decreased their activity in response to NINE and showed an intermediate attraction (a trade-off) to female odour when paired with MNE. The intermediate attraction indicates that predators may inhibit mate search, and that male newts apparently take greater risks during the breeding season. Results from tests conducted at two sites within the same pond complex demonstrated plasticity in response to MNE. One site showed the laboratory trade-off between mate search and predator avoidance for males, while at the second site, no significant avoidance of MNE was detected for either sex. To explain the discrepancy in MNE avoidance between the sites we propose a trade-off that incorporates risk and resource sensitivity. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB There are numerous studies of between-individual variation in the expression of sexually selected traits, but relatively few of variation within individuals. We investigated within-individual variation, both between and within years, in the size of the sexually selected white forehead patch of the male collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis. Patch size was determined from direct measurements of maximum height and width and by image analysis of photographs. Measures obtained by the two methods were highly correlated with each other. Male patch size showed significant repeatability both within and between years, but repeatability was lower for patch width than for patch height. Recent reanalysis of published data suggests that sexual selection acts mostly on the width of the patch rather than the height, suggesting that the component of patch size subject to sexual selection is most plastic. We found that, within individuals, forehead patch width changed in a predictable manner within years, becoming significantly smaller later in the breeding season. This effect was more pronounced in males with an initially larger patch. Patch size also changed predictably between years: males whose parental effort we manipulated experimentally showed corresponding changes in patch size between years, confirming an earlier finding from this population. Our results show that the size of sexually selected traits can vary within individuals, both in response to trade-offs with other life history traits, and also over short timescales. Such variation in the expression of sexually selected traits is important not only for the information it may provide about the processes controlling variation in such traits, but also because failure to account for it will reduce the accuracy of any attempt to quantify-selection on them.

AB Internal fertilization and anisogamy are thought to impede the evolution of exclusive paternal care by reducing paternity assurance and increasing male promiscuity. The potential role of sexual selection in easing these constraints is currently being examined in vertebrates but has not been seriously studied in most arthropods. To distinguish the effects of sexual from natural selection on the evolution of arthropod paternal care, I tested predictions of the state of several life history and behavioural traits under both forms of selection across all known taxa with exclusive paternal care. The results suggest parallels between prezygotic nuptial gifts and exclusive postzygotic paternal care and support the hypothesis that, in arthropods, male behaviours that enhance female reproductive success either directly by releasing females from the fecundity constraints of maternal care (enhanced fecundity hypothesis) or indirectly by identifying mates with superior genes (handicap principle) are traits on which sexual selection has acted. Under such conditions males willing to guard young become preferred mates for gravid females and enjoy greater promiscuity than males unable or unwilling to guard. Females use nest construction or the act of guarding another female's eggs as honest signals of paternal intent and quality. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB I tested the null hypothesis that females of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, were equally likely to visit leks composed of males with high versus low mating success. In laboratory trials, the observed distribution of matings among males differed significantly from that expected by chance, owing primarily to the higher than expected numbers of individuals with low (mated 0-1 days over 6 consecutive observation days) or high (mated 4 or more days) mating scores. I termed these two groups as 'low' and 'high' maters, respectively. In the field, greater numbers of female sightings were made at artificial leks of high maters than low maters. This result apparently reflected a greater calling propensity among high maters. Slopes of female sightings versus calling level did not differ significantly between leks of low and high maters, suggesting that the observed relationship between calling activity and female sightings was independent of male mating status. Following the same protocol, I conducted a second experiment to examine whether males used the signals of conspecific males to locate lek sites and, if so, whether signal attractiveness varied with male mating ability. Attraction of males to calling conspecifics was far weaker than that observed for females, and over five different trials a total of only seven male sightings were made at any of the established leks.

AB Aggressiveness during intersexual conflicts is predicted to depend on its costs, the value of winning and the power asymmetry of the contestants, all of which may vary between populations. In the marine isopod Idotea baltica (Pallas) a conflict occurs as females resist the attempts by males to start precopulatory mate guarding. We analysed contest dynamics with respect to female maturity stage, that is, to time left to reproductive moult, with which the payoffs of guarding for males and females change, We did this in two populations that differ in synchrony of reproduction, sex ratio and the degree of sexual dimorphism. The intensity and dynamics of contests differed between populations: in the more size-dimorphic population, females, the smaller sex, resisted less by forceful flexing but more by hooking their body than in the other population. Male aggressiveness stayed at a constant level with respect to female maturity. In the less size-dimorphic population, female resistance by flexing was intense and it decreased, while male persistence increased, with the approaching reproductive moult. Contests were more intense with small than with large males. These results fit well with the predictions from models of conflict behaviour. Assessment of the payoffs of winning versus contest costs, coadaptation of the level of aggressiveness to the other traits affecting contest outcome, and counteradaptations by the sexes to each other largely explain the dynamics and between-population differences of these contests.

AB Copulation duration is highly variable (0.5-3 h) in the damselfly, Ceriagrion tenellum (Coenagrionidae). Using laboratory experiments, we tested four adaptive hypotheses to explain this variation: the effect of time constraints, in-copula mate guarding, sperm displacement and cryptic female choice. Copulation duration was negatively correlated with time of day, as predicted by the first two hypotheses, and positively correlated with male density, as predicted by the mate-guarding hypothesis. Males prolonged copulation in response to the volume of sperm stored by females, suggesting they were able to detect and quantify the amount of sperm stored. This behaviour is not explained by mate guarding or time constraint effects. Males removed all the sperm from the bursa copulatrix in just 10 min. Our results also suggest that, because the duct is too narrow to allow male genitalia to enter, males do not remove spermathecal sperm. Therefore, direct sperm removal could not explain long copulations. Prolonged copulations could also have evolved as a result of cryptic female choice if they increase male fertilization success by female-mediated processes. Our results support this idea: male fertilization success was greater after long copulations. Apparently, male copulatory behaviour elicits female responses that increase male fertilization success.

AB Nearest-neighbour analysis is commonly used to calculate indices of aggregation in groups of animals. It has several problems, however, including lack of data independence and, when studying groups of animals penned at high densities, the difficulty of determining a given individual's nearest neighbour. We describe an entropy-based method to assess the degree of association (or segregation) of groups of animals. We show that this method gives more information and is more sensitive than the nearest neighbour technique. An example with a particular experimental situation (mixing groups of lambs) is presented.

AB This study, conducted in deep pools in three rivers, is the first to show a clear three-dimensional habitat segregation in size groups (equivalent to age groups) of juvenile Atlantic Salmon, Salmo salar, and brown trout, S. trutta. Young-of-the-year (YOY) held position near the river bed and the river bank; height above bottom and distance from river bank increased significantly with fish size. Brown trout held position significantly further from the substratum, and were on average closer to the river bank, than salmon. The vertical segregation of young salmonids was most evident among young trout, with YOY being closest to the bottom. This size-dependent segregation is probably a result of different outcomes of the trade-off between the conflicting interests of higher food availability and greater predation risk in the upper part of the water column. We suggest that intercohort predation and competitive interactions were the main reasons why YOY of both species and salmon yearlings held positions close to the river bed. We found no evidence of salmon and trout parr preferring; particular water depths, as studies in shallow parts of dyers have suggested, as the correspondence of use and availability of microhabitats at different water depths was high in the pools.

AB In Lorenz's 'psychohydraulic model', behaviour is regulated by performance: the motivation to perform a behaviour builds up with time and can be reduced only by performance itself. However, a convincing example of Lorenzian regulation has been lacking. We studied dustbathing in featherless and feathered chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, the latter trained to dustbathe on glass with sand underneath. In both cases the function, that is, plumage cleaning, was eliminated. In both featherless and feathered chicks dustbathing increased with time since the last performance as found in normal dustbathing, and there was a compensatory adjustment when the amount of previous dustbathing was artificially reduced. We suggest that the amount of dustbathing performed at any one time may be controlled by the cooperative action of a deprivation or timer mechanism and a counter mechanism. The timer mechanism responds to the time since the last performance, whereas the counter mechanism records the number of elements during that last dustbathing. Alternatively, there may be a single mechanism that continually records the deficit in the amount of dustbathing performed. Lorenz's model may be valid not only for dustbathing in fowl but also for other comfort behaviours. Our results suggest the existence of behavioural needs that can be satisfied only by performance.

AB We studied the begging display of nestling cuckoos, Cuculus canorus, reared by reed warbler, Acrocephalus scirpaceus, hosts, to test various hypotheses for the cuckoo's unusually rapid begging call. The hypotheses are not mutually exclusive but focus on different parts of the chain: chick need-begging signals-provisioning by hosts. We reject two hypotheses. (1) Cuckoo chicks do not use their exaggerated begging to counteract host rejection: begging displays varied with hunger and functioned entirely to solicit-food. (2) Cuckoos also do not exaggerate their begging calls simply because they need more food than a host brood. Single cuckoos grew at a similar rate to a brood of four reed warblers, and more slowly than a blackbird, Turdus merula, chick (a nonparasitic chick of similar size). Our data support two other hypotheses. (3) To elicit sufficient care in reed warbler nests, the cuckoo must exaggerate the vocal component of its display to compensate for its deficient visual signal (a single gape) compared with a host brood. Thus rapid calling reflects the way the cuckoo exploits the provisioning rules that hosts use to feed their own young. (4) In theory, cuckoos should be more selfish than host young because their greed is unconstrained by kinship. Our data are equivocal; compared with host broods, cuckoos solicited a higher provisioning rate in relation to one measure of need but not for another. We discuss whether cuckoos are likely to have gens-specific begging displays. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Moving an animal from the environmental context in which it has learned a particular task to an entirely different context can reduce performance. We investigated the effect of switching environmental contexts on the ability of adult laboratory rats, Rattus norvegicus, to recognize and habituate to repeated presentations of juvenile conspecifics. Adults were exposed to juveniles for four periods of 5 min, separated by a 15-min interval. Rats either received all four exposures in the same context, or the first three in one context and the fourth in a different context. Half the rats in this latter group were familiarized with both contexts prior to testing, the other half had no experience of either. In ail groups; the adults reduced their investigation of the juveniles over the three initial exposures. Mild aggression increased over the same period for the context-unfamiliar rats. A significant reduction in investigation by these rats between the third and fourth exposures, when the context was changed, suggested that the context switch further increased habituation to the juveniles. However, the context-familiar rats showed no such change, indicating that the changes observed for the context-unfamiliar rats were due to the effect of context novelty. This was supported by the finding that, during the first exposure, context-familiar adults investigated juveniles more and were more aggressive than those for which the contexts were novel. These results suggest that familiar contextual cues play only a minor role in the short-term social memory of laboratory rats. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We studied the possibility that a parasite, a hydracharinid mite, chooses its host, a chironomid midge. Mites, Unionicola ypsilophora, were placed into containers with either one or two Chironomus plumosus pupae and we counted the number of mites on the midges after the latter had emerged. Fewer mites were rejected by hosts when they had a choice of host, suggesting that they actively choose which individual to parasitize. In several midge species collected in the wild, fluctuating asymmetry in wing length was a good predictor of mite infestation. We suggest that mites use some correlate of fluctuating asymmetry to make their choice of host. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Individual sibling recognition in experimental broods of common tern

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID KIN-RECOGNITION; GULLS
AB Studies of kin recognition in birds have usually examined parent-offspring recognition, while studies of sibling recognition are relatively rare. Using choice experiments, we studied the development of sibling recognition among common tern, Sterna hirundo, chicks and tested the cues used for recognition. We collected newly hatched common tern chicks and raised them in a laboratory in 10 artificial broods of three. Chicks showed a significant preference for broodmates ('siblings') over familiar nonsiblings (nonsiblings from neighbouring broods) when first tested at 4 days posthatching, earlier than previously reported. Preferential approach to siblings was most common in broods with low levels of intrabrood aggression. Responsiveness of test chicks was highest when test chicks and stimulus chicks could both see and hear each other and lowest when they could only hear each other. Sibling-biased approach did not depend on stimulus and test chicks seeing each other, only on test chicks seeing (and probably hearing) stimulus chicks. Surprisingly, no preference was shown for siblings over strange nonsiblings, suggesting that a preference for siblings may involve learning the identity of not only siblings, but also of chicks from neighbouring broods.

AB A composite index incorporating the frequency and structure (target, type of defence, etc.) of play fighting was used to compare the complexity of such play in 13 species of muroid rodents whose behaviour has been previously described. A phylogenetic comparison of the distribution of the complexity of play fighting revealed that relatedness did not predict complexity. The most likely pattern for the ancestral rodent was moderate levels of complexity, from which increases or decreases in complexity then appeared to have evolved independently, at the level of subfamily and genus. Given that phylogeny did not predict the distribution of the pattern of play fighting, an alternative hypothesis was tested. That is, that instead, the distribution was produced by species differences in sociality, as reflected by the degrees of male-female association amongst adults. The analysis revealed that play complexity was unrelated to species differences in sociality, with both highly social and relatively asocial species being equally likely to have high or low levels of play complexity. The implications of these results for the evolution of mammalian play are considered. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Population genetic models have suggested that siblicicle between the larvae of parasitoid wasps, once gained, can be lost only under stringent;conditions, making transitions from solitary to gregarious development rare. However, phylogenetic studies suggest that gregarious development has evolved on numerous occasions, although the mechanisms are largely unknown. We report experiments, on two morphologically similar species of alysiine braconids, directed at an understanding of how gregarious development evolved in one subfamily. We compared the oviposition behaviour and development of Aphaereta genevensis and A. pallipes in the laboratory, on the host Drosophila virilis. Aphaereta genevensis usually lays a single egg in each host, and only a single wasp usually develops successfully even when several eggs are laid. However, A. pallipes often lays more than one egg in each host, and several offspring often complete development. Dissections of superparasitized hosts showed that this difference is accompanied by differences in larval behaviour: first-instar A. genevensis use their sharp mandibles to kill other parasitoid eggs or larvae in the same host. First-instar A. pallipes also have sharp mandibles, but do not attack conspecific larvae, suggesting that siblicide might have been lost by a simple change in larval behaviour. Aphaereta genevensis shows some features that may have helped select for reduction in larval aggression in the subfamily: a longer development time, multiple egg clutches and incomplete brood reduction. Aphaereta spp. show great promise as model systems for studying the evolution of siblicide. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The effects of the interaction between the operational sex ratio (OSR) and a resource (i.e. oviposition site) on mating dynamics have rarely been considered. We examined the effect of the resource presence and its interaction, with the effect of OSR on copulation duration in Rhagoletis juglandis, a tephritid fly species characterized by a resource-defence mating system in which males defend territories on walnut fruit. In this species, copulation duration varies from 30 s to over Ih and was shown previously to respond strongly to changes in OSR. In the field, short copulations tended to begin and end on fruit, whereas most long copulations generally began on fruit but ended in the foliage, suggesting a possible effect of resource presence on the copulation duration. In laboratory assays of isolated pairs, copulations were significantly shorter in the presence of a surrogate fruit, confirming the effect of resource presence. In another laboratory assay, in which we manipulated OSR independently of resource presence, resource presence and OSR were additive in their effects. Results are discussed in the context of sperm competition theory. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Adult California ground squirrels, Spermophilus beecheyi beecheyi, actively confront and harass northern Pacific rattlesnakes, Crotalus viridis oreganus, which are the principal predator of ground squirrel pups. In this report we examine the roles of risk (snake size) and context (location of encounter and squirrel reproductive category) in rattlesnake assessment by ground squirrels. In interpreting the results, we. borrow heavily from the well-developed conceptual framework applied in the analogous case of intraspecific conflict. Large and small snakes were tethered near the home burrows of male ground squirrels, and maternal and nonmaternal female ground squirrels. Ground squirrels appeared to employ assessment strategies which served to mediate the level of risk associated with confronting larger snakes. The results suggest that ground squirrels exercise greater caution when dealing with large snakes and invest more in monitoring the snake from a safe distance. Maternal squirrels, which have more at stake reproductively, spent more time and effort in snake-directed activities than did squirrels from other reproductive categories. Mothers also differentiated more strongly between large and small snakes, perhaps reflecting the greater vulnerability of their pups to larger snakes. Finally, ground squirrels discriminated between snakes found close to their home burrow and those encountered further abroad. At the home burrow, squirrels monitored the snake from a closer distance, displayed a greater willingness to confront the snake, and escalated to more dangerous levels of harassment. This assessment strategy may reflect a higher payoff to squirrels that persist in driving snakes out of the home area, thereby reducing the risk of future ambush.

   REGULATION; INCUBATION; TEMPERATURE; YOUNG
AB Chilled embryos of pelicans, Pelecanus erythrorhynchos, begin to vocally solicit parental heat at the pipped-egg stage. Honest signalling models predict that if vocal heat solicitation is a true reflection of need, then solicitation should be costly and costs should increase with the embryo's need for warmth. Using open-flow respirometry, we measured the metabolic costs associated with vocal heat solicitation by exposing embryos to either a decreasing or increasing series of body temperatures, ranging from 25 to 37.8 degrees C. We measured baseline costs (stable temperature, embryo silent) and costs associated with cold-induced calling at each temperature. At natural incubation temperature (37.8 degrees C), call rates and costs associated with calling were negligible, as was thermal need. Metabolic costs relative to baseline costs and: costs per-call increased with thermal need as body temperature declined. Absolute metabolic costs increased between 37.8 and 35 degrees C, then remained stable down to 25 degrees C; Call rates increased as embryos were chilled within the range of temperatures most frequently experienced in nature (35-37.8 degrees C), then decreased significantly for all lower temperatures, probably owing to reduced overall metabolic rate at lower temperatures (25-37.8 degrees C). The results generally support the honest signalling prediction that vocal heat solicitation is metabolically costly, and that costs increase with need.

AB We investigated how male cricket frogs, Acris crepitans, alter their advertisement calls in response to broadcasts of synthetic calls that were either 'attractive' or 'aggressive'. The stimulus calls differed in temporal but not spectral characteristics. Male cricket frogs produced a more aggressive call when presented with the aggressive stimulus, indicating that they perceived the temporal differences between the two call categories. The direction and degree of temporal and spectral changes depended on the relative dominant frequency of the resident and opponent. If the resident's dominant frequency was initially higher than the stimulus frequency, the pattern of change in dominant frequency mirrored that seen for the temporal call characters. In contrast, if the resident's initial dominant frequency was below that of the stimulus, then the temporal and spectral changes were in opposite directions. Furthermore, stimulus order influenced whether males responded differently to playbacks of aggressive and attractive calls; males that received the aggressive call first produced more aggressive calls during the aggressive stimulus, while males that received the attractive call first produced similar calls in response to the two stimuli. This suggests that experience with different types of signals influences the subsequent calling behaviour of male cricket frogs. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To study the variation and consistency of song preferences in Drosophila virilis females, we played them species-specific song and songs with modified sound pulses and/or interpulse intervals on 3 consecutive days; Species-specific song was played again on the fourth day. All playbacks were done without the presence of males. About 62% of the females indicated their readiness to mate by spreading their wings in at least one of the trials. The proportion of the females responding to species-specific song was about twice that of the females responding to modified songs. The majority of females responded to only one song type, which suggests that the females varied in their preferences and that their preference windows were rather narrow. The females were consistent in their responsiveness to species-specific song played on 2 days. If the female responded to normal song during the first trial, the probability of her responding to the same song during the second trial increased by about 32%. The number of songs required by the females before responding in the two subsequent trials was also correlated within the females (repeatability 0.328). Repeatability of female preferences for male sexual traits is expected both in the viability and Fisherian models of sexual selection. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB I conducted feeding experiments to determine the effect of variations in;food availability on individual; flocking behaviour and foraging efficiency in a social corvid, the alpine chough, Pyrrhocorax graculus, which lives in large flocks all year round. In 37 trials I varied both food quantity and the number of food patches. A decrease in the amount of available food reduced the mean flock size, the proportion of birds that had access to food, and their mean pecking rate. A decrease in the number of patches, on the other hand, reduced only the proportion of birds that had access to food. The number of choughs foraging was not influenced by food competition but depended only on the number visiting the site. Females competed less well than males: when food was made scarce, they frequented the site in the same proportion as did males, but had less access to food. I suggest that in this social corvid, long-term advantages to flocking related to social bonds, such as the maintenance of pair bonds, may compensate for short-term costs such as a reduction in foraging efficiency.

AB Comparative analysis of nonhuman animal communication systems and their complexity, particularly in comparison to human language, has been generally hampered by both a lack of sufficiently extensive data sets and appropriate analytic tools. Information theory measures provide an important quantitative tool for examining and comparing communication systems across species. In this paper we use the original application of information theory, that of statistical examination of a communication system's structure and organization. As an example of the utility of information theory to the analysis of animal communication systems, we applied a series of information theory statistics to a statistically categorized set of bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, whistle vocalizations. First, we use the first-order entropic relation in a Zipf-type diagram (Zipf 1949, Human Behavior and the Principle of least Effort) to illustrate the application of temporal statistics as comparative indicators of repertoire complexity, and as possible predictive indicators of acquisition/learning in animal,vocal repertoires. Second, we illustrate the need for more extensive temporal data sets when examining the higher entropic orders, indicative of higher levels of internal informational structure, of such vocalizations, which could begin to allow the statistical reconstruction of repertoire organization. Third,;we propose using 'communication capacity' as a measure of the degree of temporal structure and complexity of statistical correlation, represented by the values of entropic order, as an objective tool for interspecies comparison of communication complexity. In doing so, we introduce a new comparative measure, the slope of Shannon entropies, and illustrate how it potentially can be used to compare the organizational complexity of vocal repertoires across a diversity of species. Finally, we illustrate the nature and predictive application of these higher-order entropies using a preliminary sample of dolphin whistle vocalizations. The purpose of this preliminary report is to re-examine the original application of information theory to the field of animal communication, illustrate its potential utility as a comparative tool for examining the internal informational structure of animal vocal repertoires and their development, and discuss its relationship to behavioural ecology and evolutionary theory.

ID RIGHT-WHALES EUBALAENA; NORTH-ATLANTIC; HUMAN DNA; POPULATION; ADOPTION
AB Although harbour seals may not recognize their relatives, relatives could be chosen preferentially for fostering (i.e. kin selection) if harbour seals display natal philopatry coupled with breeding site fidelity, and thus kin are clustered within the colony. We used behavioural and genetic data to investigate population structure within the Sable Island breeding colony and to test whether harbour seals tend to foster related pups. Adult females on Sable Island showed a high level of breeding-colony site fidelity but low levels of within-colony site fidelity both within and between years. Similarly, although lactating females showed a clumped distribution, group composition was highly variable, suggesting that this study colony was not composed of groups of related animals, DNA fingerprint data supported the hypothesis that female distribution within the colony was not correlated with genetic relatedness. Furthermore, the mean DNA band sharing among foster dyads did not differ significantly from that for unrelated animals. These results indicate that among harbour seals, related pups are not usually chosen preferentially for fostering and hence, kin selection is not likely to be influencing the occurrence of this behaviour.

TI Reproductive skew and indiscriminate infanticide
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB In communally breeding animals, there is an evolutionary conflict over the partitioning of reproduction within the group. If dominant group members do not have complete control over subordinate reproduction, this conflict may favour the evolution of infanticidal behaviour (by either subordinates or dominants or both). Elimination of offspring, however, is likely to be constrained by the difficulty of discriminating between an individual's own progeny and those of cobreeders. Here, we develop an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) model of reproductive partitioning, which demonstrates that killing of young can be favoured, even if such discrimination is not possible. The model predicts that infanticide will typically be associated with elevated levels of offspring production, and is most likely to prove evolutionarily stable when the coefficient of relatedness between cobreeders is low, and offspring are cheap to produce. The effect of infanticide is to release subordinates from the reproductive restraint they would otherwise be forced to exercise, leading to reduced reproductive skew. When infanticide is possible, addition of numerous young to the joint brood will not lower overall productivity, because progeny in excess of the most productive brood size are eliminated. Subordinates are thus free to contribute more young to the brood than would otherwise be the case. In addition, we show that the possibility of infanticide may influence the pattern of reproduction within a group even if no offspring are actually killed at equilibrium.

AB We conducted playback experiments with wild bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, to determine whether there is sufficient information in their individually distinctive signature whistles for individual recognition. We conducted experiments with members of a resident community of dolphins in waters near Sarasota, Florida, during temporary capture-release projects. We used a paired playback design, wherein the same two whistle sequences were predicted to evoke opposite responses from two different target animals. This design controlled for any unknown cues that may have been present in the playback stimuli. We predicted that mothers would respond more strongly to the whistles of their own independent offspring than to the whistles of a familiar, similar-aged nonoffspring. Similarly, we predicted that independent offspring would respond more strongly to the whistles of their own mother than to the whistles of a familiar, similar-aged female. Target animals were significantly (P<0.02) more likely to respond to the predicted stimuli, with responses measured by the number of head turns towards the playback speaker. In bottlenose dolphin societies, stable, individual-specific relationships are intermixed with fluid patterns of association between individuals. In primate species that live in similar 'fission-fusion' type societies, individual recognition is commonplace. Thus, when taken in the context of what is known about the social structure and behaviour of bottlenose dolphins, these playback experiments suggest that signature whistles are used for individual recognition.

AB Hermit crabs that rely on gastropod shells for protection have to assess a number of shell features, each of which can bring different, and sometimes conflicting, advantages to their bearer. We examined how environmentally induced stress, in the form of hypoxia, can alter the relative benefits of different shell features and result in the selection of different shells by the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. Hermit crabs under hypoxic conditions spent significantly less time investigating shells before entering them. Despite this apparently superficial assessment, they chose shells that were well suited to hypoxic conditions; After 24 h, they were found in shells that were significantly lighter than those chosen by hermit crabs under normal oxygen. This shift in preference was achieved at the expense of the internal spaciousness of the shell, which may have deleterious implications for predation and reproduction. This cost was more evident for larger hermit crabs since there was no relationship between hermit crab size and shell characteristics for hermit crabs in hypoxia. Under oxygen stress, hermit crabs therefore alter their shell preference in favour of lighter, and thus smaller, shells, probably reflecting a greater concern for energy minimization than protection from predation or reproduction.

AB Studies on captive bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops trumcatus, have shown that each individual produces a stereotyped, individually specific signature whistle; however, no study has demonstrated clear context-dependent usage of these whistles. Thus, the hypothesis that signature whistles are used to maintain group cohesion remains untested. To investigate whether signature whistles are used only in contexts that would require a mechanism to maintain group cohesion, we examined whistle type usage in a group of four captive bottlenose dolphins in two contexts. Individuals were recorded while they were separate from the group and while they all swam in the same pool. Separations occurred spontaneously when one animal swam into another pool. No partitions were used and no aggressive interactions between dolphins preceded separations. Calling animals were identified by an amplitude comparison of the same sound recorded in the two pools. Each dolphin primarily produced one stereotyped signature whistle when it was separated from the group. Similarly the remaining group in the other pool also used primarily their signature whistles if one animal was in a separate pool. If all animals swam in the same pool almost only nonsignature whistles were used. Signature whistle copying was rare and did not initiate reunions pr specific vocal responses. The results strongly support the hypothesis that signature whistles are used to maintain group cohesion. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Kin recognition and discrimination ale thought to occur in several species of various taxonomic groups. In salmonid fish, juveniles can discriminate between odours of siblings and nonsiblings from the same population even if the odour donors and the test fish have been reared separately since fertilization. This indicates that some genetic factor is important in the recognition process. The mechanisms behind kin recognition and discrimination have not yet been described. In the present study, we performed fluviarium tests to examine whether kin recognition and discrimination in juvenile Arctic charr are influenced by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Prior to the fluviarium tests, exon 2 of an MHC class II B gene in charr was analysed with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and individual genotypes were determined. In the fluviarium, when fish had the choice between water scented by an MHC identical sibling: and a sibling with a different MHC genotype they preferred water from identical siblings. Moreover, water scented by an MHC different sibling was preferred to water from an MHC different nonsibling. However, we observed no discrimination when the test fish shared one allele with the nonsibling donor but no alleles with the sibling donor. Our results indicate that the MHC has a significant influence on the odours used for kin recognition and discrimination in juvenile Arctic charr.

AB Experiments with sex allocation in parasitic wasps offer excellent opportunities for testing how the way in which organisms process information about their environment influences behaviour. If mating takes place in temporary patches, where only a small number of females produce offspring, then sex allocation theory predicts a female-biased sex ratio. When females lay different numbers of offspring in a patch, females that produce relatively fewer offspring should lay a less female-biased, or even male-biased, sex ratio. Recent theoretical models have predicted that the exact form of this relationship depends upon whether females know only their own clutch size (self knowledge) or also the clutch sizes laid by the other females on the patch (complete knowledge). We tested the predictions of these models by examining sex allocation when two females of the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis oviposited simultaneously on a patch. The offspring sex ratio (proportion of males) produced by a female was: (1) negatively correlated with the number of offspring that she laid; and (2) positively correlated with the body size of the other female on the patch. Larger females matured more eggs and laid more offspring in the experimental patch. This suggests that, as predicted by the complete knowledge model, the offspring sex ratio laid by a female became more female biased as she laid a greater proportion of the total off spring laid on the patch. Furthermore, females use the body size of other females to assess the clutch sizes that these will lay. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The common occurrence of adoption among birds and mammals presents evolutionary biologists with an explanatory challenge. The benefits to adoptees are self-evident, but the benefits to the adopter(s), the origin of the set of behaviours that constitute 'adoptive' behaviour, and the conditions for its spread in populations are not always clear. Explanations in terms of direct and indirect benefits to adopters and adoptees, and in terms of conflict between them have been suggested to account for the current functions and the evolutionary origin of 'adoptive' behaviour. In this paper we emphasize one aspect of the parenting behaviour associated with adoption that has been neglected: eve suggest that adoption in birds and mammals is a route for the transfer of learnt information through social learning of patterns of behaviour, including styles of parenting. By using simple models we show that learning parenting from non-parents may provide additional opportunities for the spread of the 'adoptive' behaviour itself, even when it has no selective advantage. We also offer an additional explanation for the adaptive significance of adoption for both adopters and adoptees. Our 'match-making' hypothesis suggests that in some cases, by adopting foreign young, parents provide their genetic young with future ecologically compatible, but genetically unrelated, mates.

AB I tested the migratory orientation of redstarts in a true-zero magnetic field to elucidate the importance to this species of access to either magnetic or celestial cues. I also tested the validity of the assumption on which all funnel experiments are based: that what we observe in an orientation funnel reflects what the bird would do if actually migrating. In a set of funnel experiments, I tested 47 night-migrating redstarts caught during their first autumn migration. Each bird was tested once under each of four experimental conditions in a semi-randomized block-design. Upon completion of the final funnel tests the birds were fitted with light indicators and released. The results showed that redstarts can find the migratory direction on the basis of access to either celestial or magnetic cues. Thus, when celestial cues were available they could orient in a true-zero magnetic field. In addition, a starry sky facilitated high migratory activity as well as a clearly directed orientation. The release experiments showed that the vanishing bearings on nights with no wind were in good agreement with the direction of the funnel activity, but that the vanishing bearings were strongly influenced even by light wind.

AB The reproductive strategy of female alpine accentors, Plunella collaris, was studied on the summit of Mt Norikura in Japan. Alpine accentors formed polygynandrous groups consisting of three to six males and three to five females; however, each female laid eggs in her own nest. Within each group, females were organized in stable, linear hierarchies based on age. All females were sexually active but high-ranking females copulated more frequently with several males from the group. In contrast, the degree of multiple mating and frequency of copulations of low-ranking females was lower because their sexual activity was interrupted by more dominant females. All copulations were preceded by female solicitation. When the young hatched, males helped to feed the chicks of several females with whom they had copulated. The main factor influencing reproductive success was the amount of parental care that was available for feeding the chicks. High-ranking females had paternal help from two or more males and secured a high provisioning rate for the brood, which increased fledging success and nestling weight. The reproductive success of low-ranking females was lower because the brood did not receive sufficient paternal investment and so often starved to death early in the nestling period. These results suggest that the greatest potential benefit females might obtain from multiple mating is the subsequent assistance of several males in caring for the offspring. I discuss the implications of these observations with the idea that competition among females for males brings about multiple mating as a female reproductive strategy.

AB Lazarus & Inglis (Anim. Behav., 1986, 34, 1791-1804) introduced a model of the influence of brood size on the optimal level of parental investment and parent-offspring conflict and drew a distinction between shared and unshared types of parental investment. With respect to this division, we measured the parental costs in the goldeneye, Bucephala clangula, a precocial species with uniparental female care, in terms of time spent in vigilance and intraspecific aggression. We also compared levels of anti-predator vigilance and intraspecific aggression between females with and without broods. Females with broods spent considerably more time on both vigilance and intraspecific aggression, but anti-predator vigilance was independent of brood size. Furthermore, female behaviour was unaffected by brood reduction. Both these observations support the 'fixed-loss' model of unshared care, where the level of parental investment is predicted to be independent of brood size, since the predator is likely to take only a single offspring. In contrast, intraspecific aggression, mainly associated with defence of the brood's feeding area, increased with brood size. This supports the 'shared care' model where the level of parental investment increases with brood size, a type of care usually associated with altricial species.

AB Studies have shown that female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, prefer to associate with males wearing symmetric leg band combinations. In this study, I used a four-choice chamber apparatus to investigate this preference, and to determine whether it is influenced by band coloration. I created band combinations by banding males with four leg bands. The symmetrical combinations consisted of two bands on each leg; the asymmetrical combinations consisted of three bands on one leg and one band on the other leg. For each of the symmetry treatments, all four bands were either light green or red. Females did not spend significantly more time associating with males wearing symmetrical bands or with males wearing red bands. The duration of male-female associations was not influenced by an interaction between symmetry category and band colour treatment. None of 10 females spent the most time with males with red symmetrical bands. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Courtship feeding in the majority of insects may influence female reproductive patterns either directly, through effects of the gift material, or indirectly, through correlated effects of prolonged copulation and larger ejaculates. This distinction is important because the cause of changes in fecundity may influence patterns of the allocation of resources between the sexes, with implications for the intensity of sexual selection and magnitude of sexual conflict. I show that post-copulatory feeding on the secretions of a gland on the metanotum of male Oecanthus nigricornis Walker correlates with oviposition and affects the number of sperm remaining within the spermatophore. Manipulations of gland feeding and insemination duration showed that changes in fecundity are due to the gift rather than the ejaculate. Metanotal gland feeding increased female fecundity by increasing reproductive life span without significantly increasing oviposition rate. These changes in reproduction were directly due to the gift itself. Although gland feeding was positively correlated with the duration of insemination and thus the number of sperm transferred from the spermatophore to the female, experimentally prolonging or reducing insemination had no significant effect on reproductive life span. Male phenotype was also associated with female fecundity but in this case the effect was caused by an increase in the oviposition rate of females that mated with relatively large males. Male size had no significant effect on female reproductive life span, suggesting that its effect is not simply due to a quantitative increase in gift size. Three other measures of male phenotype, fluctuating asymmetry, condition (i.e. size-standardized wet body mass) and age, had no significant effects on female reproduction.

AB We investigated whether capuchin monkeys cooperate to solve a task and to what extent they take into account the behaviour of another individual when cooperating. Two groups of capuchin monkeys (N=5 and 6) were tested in a task whose solution required simultaneous pulling of two handles which were too far from one another to be pulled by one monkey. Before carrying out the cooperation study, individual monkeys were trained to pull one handle (training phase 1) and to pull two handles simultaneously (training phase 2) for a food reward. Nine subjects were successful in training phase 1, and five in training phase 2. In the cooperation study seven subjects were successful, that is, pulled one handle while a companion pulled the other. Further analyses revealed that capuchins did not increase their pulling actions when a partner was close to or at the other handle, that is, when cooperation might occur. These data suggest that capuchin monkeys acted together at the task and got the reward without understanding the role of the partner and without taking its behaviour into consideration. Social tolerance, as well as their tendency to explore and their manual dexterity, were the major factors accounting for the capuchins' success.

ID ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR; TEMPERATURE; LOCOMOTION; RESPONSES
AB The influence of body temperature on the defensive behaviours of the Eastern garter snake was investigated. Snakes encountered in the field were grabbed by hand at mid-body to imitate the attack of a predator or were approached in the same manner but without any contact by the investigator. Behavioural responses were related to snake body and ambient temperatures. When approached without contact, snakes with higher body temperatures fled more often than snakes with lower body temperatures. Snakes that showed body flattening or flattening with mouth gaping had significantly lower average body temperatures than snakes that showed mouth gaping without flattening, those that showed neither mouth gaping nor flattening or those that showed biting (both with and without mouth gaping and flattening). The energetic constraints of a lower body temperature appear to influence the defensive behaviours of garter snakes. Colder snakes are more likely to show body flattening; warmer snakes either flee or, if they are unable to flee, are more likely to show more mouth gaping, biting or none of these behaviours.

AB Artificial weaning in laboratory mice elicits increased levels of exploratory and escape behaviour. Under barren housing conditions patterns of exploration and escape subsequently develop into stereotypic behaviour. Weaning weight in wild house mice, Mus musculus domesticus, is known to affect offspring fitness, thus reduced weaning weight represents a risk to fitness. In male ICR-mice, Mus musculus, precocious weaning 3 days prior to standard weaning age tended to decrease growth rate in the long term, and differences in weaning weight of mice weaned at the standard age persisted into adulthood. Both plasma corticosterone levels 48 h after weaning and adult stereotypy levels were higher in precociously weaned mice, but also in animals weaned at the usual age but at a low weight. These results suggest that potential costs in terms of fitness may affect stress levels at the onset of stereotypy development and predispose ICR-mice to perform stereotypies at a high level when adult.

AB Female mate-sampling behaviour and mate choice were investigated in a natural population of sand gobies, Pomatoschistus minutus. The sand goby is a promiscuous fish with paternal care. Gravid females were released in the field and watched while they inspected potential mates. In total, 26 females were observed until they spawned. Half of the females spawned with the first male encountered. The other females inspected two or more males in sequence and never returned to a previously inspected male to mate. Females mated preferentially with males that courted intensively. The mate-sampling behaviour of the female sand gobies was most consistent with a threshold-criterion tactic, which is to be expected if search costs are important. Moreover, there was an effect of season, such that females sampled very few males early but apparently became more selective later in the breeding season. This is discussed and interpreted as an effect of varying costs and benefits of being choosy over the season. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Females try to control paternity in various ways. They may resist copulation attempts by males but they may also feign resistance in order to incite competition between males. In the lifetime monogamous bearded tit, Panurus biarmicus, chase-flights, both within pairs and with other males, occur during the female's fertile period. In general, these chase-flights are followed by copulations. Females in this study were able to resist copulations, but they also often approached males and solicited copulations by wing flapping; if males tried to mount the females, they resisted and flew away. During the fertile period females solicited extra-pair males to chase them significantly more often than they solicited chases with their own mate. In isolated pairs chase-flight activity was reduced and most copulations occurred without preceding chase-flights. In addition, females in isolated pairs solicited their partners to chase them significantly less often than females with extra males available. This suggests that females use chases to incite male-male competition and thus to obtain 'good genes'. In contrast to other studies, females paired to high-ranking males incited more chase-flights than females paired to low-ranking males, perhaps because only high-quality females could afford to perform this energetically expensive activity.

AB Mate preferences in invertebrates have usually been studied with simultaneous choice experiments alone, which allows effective detection of any preferences but does not tell much about the strength of inter-sexual selection. Under natural conditions females frequently have to rely on sequential choice, and choosy females may incur opportunity and direct costs such as loss of time when they reject a male. Female preference in the wolf spider Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata for two components of male courtship signalling, rate and volume, was investigated. Both of these characteristics were tested with a sequential choice set-up and the effect of volume also with a simultaneous choice method. Females responded more quickly to male signals with a higher rate and volume. This suggests that females use a threshold level when responding to male courtship signals and that they are prepared to suffer some costs of waiting for an opportunity to choose between males.

TI Policing and group cohesion when resources vary
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID GROUP SELECTION
AB The transition from competing individuals to cooperative groups has occurred several times in evolutionary history. The puzzle is why selfish individuals did not subvert cohesive group behaviour by taking resources without contributing to the group's overall success. Kin selection and reciprocal altruism are the two standard explanations for group cohesion. But many groups have evolved into cooperative units when relatedness was low and opportunities were limited for the strategic alliances required for reciprocity. A new theory was recently proposed in which individuals invest some of their resources into repressing competition between group members. Such policing increases the fair distribution of resources in the group and enhances group cohesion. The surprising aspect of this theory is that low relatedness is more conducive to the spread of policing traits than is high relatedness. Here a new explanation is developed of the biological processes that favour policing. The model is then extended in two ways. First, more realism is added to the theory by accounting for the full range of costs and benefits associated with competitive and cooperative traits within groups. Second, another surprising result is introduced about cooperative evolution. Small variations in individual vigour or resources can lead to large variations in individual contributions to policing the group. Stronger individuals often invest all of their excess resources into policing, but weaker individuals do not contribute to group cohesion. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Recent analyses of avian leks have come to conflicting conclusions concerning the role of male settlement on female traffic hotspots. This issue was re-examined in the sage grouse, Centrocercus urophasianus, using data on pre-nesting movements of radiotagged females and the dispersion of lekking males collected during a 10-year field study. As expected with hotspot settlement, leks were preferentially located in areas through which females travelled between wintering and nesting ranges before mating. In addition, the distribution of males among leks was related proximately to variation in numbers of females visiting each lek during the mating period and ultimately to numbers that nested within a 2-km radius, within which nesting hens were preferentially attracted. The results show both that hotspot settlement can explain certain coarse scale features of male dispersion, and that female behaviour during different stages of the pre-nesting period may influence particular components of male dispersion to differing extents.

AB The responses of males and females to a male signal were compared between two sister species, one in which the signal is present and one in which the signal is absent. The signal is a pattern of vertical bars found on males throughout the northern swordtail fish, genus Xiphophorus. In X. multilineatus, the bars function both to attract females and deter rival males. Males in X. nigrensis, the sister species to X. multilineatus, do not have bars. Xiphophorus nigrensis males did not respond differently to males with bars compared with males without bars, but X. nigrensis females were more attracted to males with bars than males without bars. Thus, the male response to bars is congruent in both taxa: male response was present when the male trait was present (in X. multilineatus) and absent when the male trait was absent (in X. nigrensis). The female response to bars, however, was congruent in X. multilineatus but incongruent in X. nigrensis: female response was present but the male trait was absent in X. nigrensis. This pattern suggests that of the three components of the communication system, (male response, female response and male signal), the signal and male response coevolved more closely than did the signal and female response.

AB Male Drosophila melanogaster exposed to virgin females that were experimentally prevented from mating had a higher death rate than males exposed to an equal number of inseminated females. Exposure to virgin females increases the rates of courtship, mating and production of sperm and accessory fluid. The present study attempted to disentangle the relative contributions of these reproductive activities to the elevated male death rate. Males in different experimental groups were induced to perform only parts of sexual activity. Comparison of longevities between these groups showed that courtship alone was sufficient to reduce male life span. Mating itself and production of seminal fluid and sperm, on the other hand, did not seem to be costly but, since any mating costs were confounded with costs of courtship, definite conclusions cannot be drawn. Surprisingly, wild type males kept with females that could not copulate died sooner than males kept with females that could mate. Despite several behavioural differences between these experimental groups, only mounting attempts showed a pattern consistent with that of longevities. Mounting attempts may be an indicator of an altered metabolic rate or hormonal status that renders the males more susceptible to death. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The possibility that animals can discriminate conspecifics and heterospecifics by integrating multiple-cue information obtained by a single sensory modality was tested using guppies, Poecilia reticulata. The influence of familiarity on guppy discrimination was examined through binary-choice experiments in which juvenile guppies were allowed to associate with familiar or unfamiliar siblings, unrelated conspecifics or heterospecifics (swordtails, Xiphothurus helleri). Stimulus and subject (test) individuals were separated by partitions made of clear Perspex or plastic mesh, and the results of trials using the two partition types were compared to provide insight into the sensory modalities involved in recognition. Guppies associated more readily with familiar than unfamiliar conspecifics. The trials with the Perspex partition revealed that visual cues were involved in conspecific discrimination. Guppies were also visually attracted to familiar swordtails, and to unfamiliar swordtails as long as the guppies were originally reared with swordtails, showing that the formation of a recognition template in early life is flexible and not controlled by a closed genetic programme. However, there was evidence that attractive long-range swordtail cues were overridden by those permitting more detailed species discrimination at close range. In the trials with the mesh partition, attraction to siblings was apparent only at close range, suggesting that the mesh impaired the visual discrimination abilities evident from the Perspex trials. Heterospecific attraction to swordtails increased when the mesh partition was used, possibly for the same reason. It is likely that guppies integrate responses to distance-dependent visual (and possibly mechanical) stimuli to permit recognition of individuals, kin members or species. With regard to discrimination studies on aquatic vertebrates, the potential advantages to be obtained from the use of complementary behavioural assay techniques, and from analyses that take into account inter-brood variation and the length of the experimental acclimation period, are stressed.

ID REPRODUCTIVE COSTS; EUMECES-LATICEPS; PREDATION; VULNERABILITY; TACTICS
AB Current reproductive effort may often be at the expense of future reproduction. One way in which future reproduction of viviparous animals may be affected is by increased. risk of predation resulting from decreased mobility associated with pregnancy. The common striped scorpion, Centruroides vittatus, may experience considerable risk of predation associated with reproduction because it is viviparous,;with an eight-month gestation period. C. vittatus also carries the newborn young on its back during their first instar. The purpose of this study was to establish a cost of viviparity and parental care in these scorpions by determining sprint speed at three reproductive stages: pregnant, carrying offspring and post-dispersal of offspring. Post-dispersal speed was used as a best estimate of non-pregnant speed. Pregnant speeds averaged 84% of post-dispersal speeds. Lower speeds were correlated with absolute and relative measures of litter size. Speed while carrying offspring averaged 61% of post-dispersal speed, and was correlated with mass of the litter and number of individuals in the litter. Sixty-five per cent of the females carrying young could not be induced to run; these females instead assumed a defensive posture. Results indicate that female scorpions experience a cost (in decreased running speed) to viviparity and parental care, and that some females may reduce this cost by using an alternative defensive strategy.

TI Using randomization techniques to analyse behavioural data

ID ECOLOGY
AB Data from behavioural studies are frequently non-normally distributed and cannot be analysed with traditional parametric statistics. Instead, behaviourists must rely on rank-transformation tests, which lose potentially valuable information present in the data. Recently, however, biologists in other disciplines have resolved similar statistical difficulties by using resampling methods. Results from Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric ANOVA and randomization tests were compared for two behavioural data sets. It was found that randomization tests were more powerful than Kruskal-Wallis, and could thus detect smaller effect sizes present in the data. In addition, the variance was calculated around the P-value at eight levels of replication ranging from 500 to 10 000, to determine the optimal number of replications for the randomization test. The variance around the P-value decreased as the number of replications increased. The P-value stabilized at 5000 replications, and thus it is recommended that at least 5000 replications be used for randomization tests on behavioural data.

AB Mated females of Dendrocerus carpenteri produce 'precise' sex ratios, with less than binomial variance, by adjusting the sequence of male and female eggs laid during a single oviposition bout. This wasp is a solitary hyperparasitoid of the prepupal and pupal stages of aphidiid parasitoids inside mummified aphids. The influence of order and quality (indexed by mummy size) of sequentially encountered hosts on offspring sex allocation was examined. Females typically laid a fertilized egg (=daughter) if the first host encountered was of high quality, but laid an unfertilized egg (=son) if the host was of low quality. The sex of the second egg generally was opposite that of the first, regardless of host quality. Host quality influenced the sex ratio response to the third and later hosts accepted during a single oviposition bout, however, with females fertilizing a greater proportion of eggs if quality was high. With each additional egg laid, the brood sex ratio asymptotically approached an equilibrium value that apparently depended on the average host quality per patch. The production schedule of sons and daughters was reset to zero after a period during which no hosts were encountered. Wasps may use simple decision rules to ensure that daughters will find mates, regardless of variations in host quality and patch size. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

   courtship: Potential mate choice
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID MIMICRY; MALES
AB Male copperheads fight for priority of access to females in the mating seasons. Fighting behaviour or combat is characterized by a prominent vertical posture (the challenge display) and a high degree of physical contact. During courtship, females frequently show a vertical posture similar to the initial stages of the challenge display of males (head lifting). To test whether head lifting influences the behaviour of courting males, three experiments were conducted. The first experiment recorded the frequency of head lifting in females during courtship and responses of males with no recent social experience to head lifting. Head lifting was frequently shown by females during courtship, and males typically responded to it by giving challenge displays. The second experiment tested responses of males that recently lost fights to head lifting. In trials where courtship occurred, head lifting repelled males in the same manner observed during subordination. The third experiment tested responses of males that recently won fights to head lifting. In these trials, males frequently challenged females that head-lifted. In all cases where males challenged females that head-lifted, fighting never occurred and all males resumed courtship. Previous work and results of this study show that head lifting is not a signal of non-receptivity, because females show receptivity (e.g, cloacal gaping) and will mate. The present results show that males of differing dominance status responded differently to head lifting. We suggest that head lifting is a mechanism of female choice involving intraspecific sexual mimicry. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The amount of pollen stored in honey bee, Apis mellifera, colonies is a selectable trait. Five generations of two-way selection resulted in high and low strains that differed more than six-fold in quantities of stored pollen. Comparisons with hybrid crosses suggested that colony-level, high pollen-hoarding behaviour is inherited as a recessive trait. Colony levels of stored honey, however, showed an over-dominant pattern, with hybrid colonies storing significantly more honey than either of the selected strains. Controlled studies of individual foraging behaviour revealed the same patterns of inheritance at the individual level: high-strain workers specialized on pollen foraging, low-strain workers on nectar, and hybrid workers demonstrated a significantly greater nectar-collecting bias than workers of the low strain. Genomic mapping studies of colony-level pollen hoarding and individual foraging behaviour have revealed two genomic regions of the honey bee that contain major quantitative trait loci that explain a large portion of the observed variance in pollen hoarding and foraging behaviour of the two strains. The effects of major genes on within- and between-colony variation in individual foraging behaviour are discussed in the context of conducting and interpreting empirical tests of foraging theory.

AB We examined the possibility that the echolocation (sonar) signals used by big brown bats convey information beyond species identity (e.g. individual identity, family membership, age class, sex). The echolocation signals of six adult females, their 12 offspring, and eight additional offspring were recorded as bats performed a standardized laboratory target-detection task. Sonar signals were analysed for consistency within individuals, and for similarity within families, within age classes (adult versus juvenile), and within sex for juveniles. Evidence was found for individual distinctiveness of emissions, for resemblance of the sonar emissions used by different individuals within a family, and for differences between the emissions of adults and juveniles. No evidence was found for differences between the echolocation calls of juvenile males and females. Individual differences in sonar signals may allow a bat to identify other bats by their sonar calls and may also prevent jamming of the bat's sonar receiver. Similarity within families suggests a heritable component to call variation, although learning cannot be ruled out and is indeed suggested by the findings that the sonar signals of family members (a mother and her offspring) are more evenly distributed in cross-correlation space than expected by chance, and that heritability estimates are higher based on mother-offspring comparisons than on sibling-sibling comparisons. The finding that the emissions of juveniles differ from those of adults and that the repeatability of sonar signals improves with the age of the juvenile suggests that acquisition of a stable, adult-like signal requires several months, well beyond the time young start flying, at about 1 month. The ability to recognize other individuals or classify them by age and family on the basis of their echolocation calls could be important to bats in a number of social interactions, including mother-offspring recognition, territoriality and altruism.

AB Callitrichids (marmosets and tamarins) are unusual among primates in having a particularly flexible mating system that spans monogamy, polyandry and polygamy, associated with twin births and male parental care. The conventional assumption has been that monogamy evolved in order to allow the female to bear a litter of two relatively expensive young. An ESS approach is used to examine the costs and benefits of monogamy versus polygamy for the male and a litter size of one versus two offspring for the female in order to evaluate the conditions for the evolution of pair-bonded monogamy plus twinning. The results suggest that twinning could not have evolved before pair bonding in these species and that, all things being equal, it would always pay males to pursue a roving-male polygamy strategy. In response to this, females pursue a number of strategies that appear to be designed to coerce the male into remaining monogamous. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Cannibalism of anuran eggs and hatchlings by larger tadpoles has been documented in many species that inhabit seasonally ephemeral habitats and has been hypothesized to play an important role in favouring synchronized breeding. Using the wood frog, this hypothesis was tested by determining whether offspring of non-synchronized breeders were more vulnerable to cannibalism than offspring of synchronized breeders. In a laboratory experiment, small tadpoles of similar size did not cannibalize each other. However, large tadpoles preyed heavily on the eggs and hatchlings of conspecifics, and the incidence of predation increased with cannibal size. In natural populations, over 80% of adults bred explosively during a 3-day period, and their offspring were not cannibalized because hatching was synchronized and tadpoles varied only slightly in size. About 5% of adults oviposited late in the breeding season, and the resulting embryos hatched when tadpoles of synchronized breeders averaged 0.6-1.3 g. Larger tadpoles in the ponds cannibalized the eggs and hatchlings of these late breeders. In a field experiment conducted at a natural breeding site, eggs that were added 7 days after embryos of late breeders hatched suffered complete mortality within 19 h. Similarly, more than 50% of hatchlings were cannibalized within 15 min after they were placed in the pond. These results are consistent with the view that synchronized breeding is an adaptation that reduces cannibalism in anurans that breed in temporary ponds.

TI TRANSFER AND INTERFERENCE IN BUMBLEBEE LEARNING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID BEES; CONSTRAINTS; CHOICE
AB The types of interactions between learning events can significantly affect the value of learning. Learning one task may enhance the learning of a subsequent task (transfer), but the learning of a new task may also interfere with the memory of a previously learned task. Bumblebees, Bombus occidentalis, were tested for the magnitudes of transfer and interference between two related learning events. On the one hand, bees showed no evidence for positive transfer from one learning task to another. On the other hand, bees showed an initial reduction in performance after switching from task 2 back to task 1. However, after being trained to switch back and forth between two tasks, bees no longer showed an initial reduction in performance after switching. The results suggest first, that bees cannot generalize from one learning incident to another in the manner required in this experiment, and second, that bees can learn to alternate between certain distinct tasks with no reduction in performance.

AB When female three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, were presented simultaneously two video playbacks of a courting male, one playback displayed in colour and the other in greytone, the female approached and attempted to follow both displays. Females that responded strongly to playback of the male clearly preferred the coloured display, whereas those that responded less showed no consistent preference for coloured or greytoned displays. Females showed some approach to playback of a non-reproductive female but did not prefer the coloured over the greytoned one. These results suggest that the female's sexual motivation influences the,mechanism(s) mediating her attraction to nuptially coloured males. Although highly motivated animals may typically show reduced selectivity in successive choice situations, they appeared to be more selective in the simultaneous choice situation studied here, perhaps because they attend more to male nuptial coloration, or because they become less fearful of brightly coloured males. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of video playback for investigating the role of visual cues in stickleback behaviour. They also emphasize the value of considering motivational factors in studies on sexual selection and, especially, when designing or interpreting experiments on mate choice.

AB Polygyny in territorial birds is predicted to arise through random female settlement when females do not suffer costs to polygyny and male territories are homogeneous with respect to female preferences. Data from a study of corn buntings, Miliaria calandra, on North Uist, Scotland, supported the hypothesis that females settle in a Poisson distribution amongst males when such conditions are met. Corn bunting nests were not spatially or temporally more spaced than predicted by chance, suggesting that females did not compete for resources. Differences between males in the composition of their territories did not explain the variation in male mating success. Primary and secondary females did not select territories in the same rank order and primary females did not settle earlier than monogamous females, as would have been predicted if territory or male quality had been important in determining where females settled.

ID TERRESTRIAL SALAMANDER; RESOURCE; QUALITY; COSTS; FOOD
AB During courtship periods, female red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, 'squash' male faecal pellets and prefer to associate with males that have the residue of lightly armoured prey (termites) in their faeces relative to males with the residue of highly armoured prey (ants). Apparently this rapid assessment of a male's diet allows females to assess his territorial quality. Two hypotheses, derived from these data, were tested. In a habitat where ants are common but termites are rare, (1) males should preferentially feed on termites in a choice situation with ants and (2) males should need to learn less about foraging tactics used to capture termites than to capture ants. Males were trained for 21 days on a diet of only termites, only ants, both prey types together, or neither (dipterans as a diet) and then were compared for their foraging successes when presented with an equal ratio of termites and ants. Under ah conditions of training, males preferred to eat termites. Males learned to begin attacks on ants faster when trained on ants, and on termites faster when trained on termites. Those trained on ants learned to capture ants more efficiently (fewer tongue-strikes per capture) and, thus, they reduced the time from encounter to capture relative to other training conditions. However, training had no significant influence on capture efficiency (consistently high) and time from encounter to capture of termites (consistently short). Therefore, males have to learn more to refine their foraging tactics with ants than with termites and are more efficient foragers on a prey type that makes them attractive to females.

AB Measures of adult feeding and foraging behaviour in the California gull, Larus californicus, were related to the growth of their offspring. Offspring showed significantly higher growth when average feeding interval, a measure of the time interval between feedings, and feeding latency following foraging decreased. The amount of time parents foraged was positively related to offspring growth and negatively correlated with average feeding interval. Either (1) increased foraging efficiency with parental age, or (2) increased reproductive effort with age, could explain age-related differences in patterns of feeding behaviour and their impact on offspring growth. However, data on foraging time support only the hypothesis of increased reproductive effort with parental age.

AB To examine whether magnetic orientation in young birds was affected by magnetic conditions in the region where they grew up, the orientation behaviour of pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca (Muscicapidae), hand-raised in Riga, Latvia (50 000 nT, 73 degrees inclination), was compared with that of conspecifics hand-raised in Frankfurt a.M., Germany (46 000 nT, 66 degrees inclination). Orientation was recorded during autumn migration in funnel cages in the local geomagnetic held under non-visual conditions. Birds that had been hand-raised in Germany without a view of the sky showed a unimodal tendency in their migratory direction, whereas in Latvia, the behaviour of birds raised under similar conditions was bimodal along the migratory axis. A second group of Latvian birds that had been exposed to a rotating planetarium sky prior to the tests also showed a unimodal preference. This suggests that celestial rotation observed during the pre-migratory period may play an important role in helping birds to decide which end of the magnetic axis points towards the wintering area.

AB Newborn female house mice, Mus domesticus, were cross-fostered to analyse the influence of relatedness and familiarity during juvenile development on subsequent reproductive success during communal rearing of young. The reproductive behaviour of polygynously mated pairs of full-sisters reared apart (unfamiliar and related) and of genetically unrelated females reared together (familiar, unrelated) was analysed over a standardized 'lifespan' of 120 days after the females were given access to a male compared with that of sisters reared together (familiar, related) and unrelated females reared apart (unfamiliar, unrelated). Familiarity with a same-sex partner (irrespective of relatedness) improved a female's probability of successfully reproducing and the probability that both partners weaned young (egalitarian reproduction). In groups with unfamiliar partners, the female that weighed less at mating suffered a higher probability of being reproductively suppressed in a despotic relationship. Furthermore, familiarity significantly improved offspring survival until weaning compared with that in social groups with previously unfamiliar females. Consequently, a female living with a familiar partner had a significantly higher lifetime reproductive success than a female with an unfamiliar partner. By choosing a familiar group member a female had a high probability of communally rearing young with a relative, owing to the basic family structure of house mouse demes. However, despite the paramount importance of familiarity with a partner for reproductive success, some data indicated that females discriminated between familiar related and familiar unrelated partners. Familiar sisters reached higher scores than familiar unrelated females in almost all fitness components and weaned the highest number and biomass of offspring within their lifespan of all groups analysed.

AB Foraging behaviour, stream habitat use and food habits of a population of the aquatic, Oregon garter snake were studied in the field during the spring and summer of 1987 and 1988. Continuous records of behaviour and habitat use were obtained for each snake. Adults foraged more actively and in a wider variety of stream habitats than juveniles or neonates. Adults also fed on a wider variety of prey types and sizes, especially concentrating on large, Pacific giant salamander, Dicamptodon tenebrosis, larvae and neotenes, in the mid-stream substrates. Juvenile and neonate snakes fed on relatively smaller prey that inhabited shallow stream margins. Consumption of relatively large prey by adults and smaller prey by juveniles indicated a shift in foraging 'strategy' from frequent feeding on small prey to infrequent feeding on large prey. These ontogenetic changes in foraging behaviour, habitat use and food habits of Oregon garter snakes are probably the result of a combination of proximate ecological, morphological and physiological constraints. Ultimately, these behavioural shifts may have a phylogenetic origin that reflects the strong advantage of single large meals versus many small meals for many modern snake lineages.

AB The polyterritorial pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, was used to investigate the deception hypothesis, which states that mated males behave as unmated to hide their mating status from prospecting females. Previous studies on this species have shown that unmated and mated males differ in territorial presence, but not when females are present in their territories. Male behaviour after female visits may differ, however, and this was tested in the present study. Caged females were presented to males during periods of 5 min and the behaviour of the males in the following hour was recorded. Mated males were present significantly less often in their territories than unmated males. Video-recordings of male behaviour after natural female visits indicated that mated males spent less time singing than unmated males, suggesting that they were often absent from their territories. Given this difference, females can potentially determine male mating status by making repeated returns to the territories of males they have visited, and sampling the presence of the males. Field data showed that females visited their chosen mate 5-37 times before mating. A model is presented which gives the probability of rejecting mated males, depending (1) on the number of repeated visits and (2) on how many of these visits a male should be present to be classified as unmated. The model also describes one cost of such behaviour, namely that of rejecting unmated males. The model indicates that females can reject up to 87-99% of the mated males by visiting males 5-37 times. In conclusion, male deception of females may be countered by females using the repeated visits strategy.

AB The ant Formica sanguinea is extremely suitable for examining reproductive competition among co-existing queens and queen-worker conflicts within colonies, because its colonies are often weakly polygynous and the queens are polyandrous. The mean relatedness, estimated by enzyme gene markers, was significantly lower among worker pupae (0.38) than among sexual female pupae (0.47) produced by the same nests. The most likely interpretation is that one of the co-existing queens dominates others in sexual production. The population sex ratio was female-biased (investment in males was 0.40), as predicted if sex allocation is controlled by workers. When the relatedness asymmetry varies between colonies (variation in the levels of polygyny and polyandry), worker control is expected to lead to split sex ratios provided that workers can assess the type of colony they are in. The distribution of colonial sex ratios was bimodal, but the colonial sex ratios were not associated with the relatedness asymmetry in the way predicted by the split sex-ratio hypothesis. This indicates that workers are unable to assess the relatedness asymmetry and/or to use that information for maximizing their inclusive fitness.

AB Under natural conditions hatchlings of the land snail Arianta arbustorum cannibalize unhatched sibling eggs. Newly hatched A. arbustorum from different populations (from a lowland forest, a subalpine forest and an alpine pasture in Switzerland) differed significantly in the frequency of cannibalistic attacks on conspecific eggs. The percentage of cannibalistic hatchlings ranged from 50.0% in a subalpine forest to 87.8% in a lowland forest. Two populations were consistent in the proportion of cannibalistic hatchlings over 3 years, while in a third population the proportion of cannibalistic hatchlings varied between years. Hatchlings from populations with a high frequency of cannibals also began to eat eggs at an earlier age. In two populations, the proportion of cannibalistic hatchlings per batch increased over the course of the season, while in a third population the proportion of cannibals per batch was constantly high. Propensity for egg cannibalism was not correlated with absolute egg size, suggesting that the amount of energy and nutrients received during embryonic development did not affect cannibalistic behaviour during the hatchling stage. Differences in the investment in single eggs could explain the inter-population variation in propensity for egg cannibalism in A. arbustorum.

TI A PREDICTABLE PATTERN OF DAILY ACTIVITY BY THE POCKET GOPHER GEOMYS
   BURSARIUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID THOMOMYS-BOTTAE; HABITS
AB Because subterranean mammals live in a microhabitat buffered from environmental extremes, it is often assumed that their daily activity patterns are weakly structured at best. The daily activity (time outside the nest) of a natural population of plains pocket gophers, Geomys bursarius, was examined using radiotelemetry. A bimodal pattern of activity was observed in which gophers were most likely to be active at night (2200-0600 hours) and in early afternoon (1300-1700 hours). Total daily activity averaged 400 min/day. Activity-bout length varied with time of day. Morning bouts were the shortest, afternoon bouts the longest, and bouts at night were of intermediate length. The overall pattern of activity was best explained as a mechanism for avoiding burrow temperature extremes. Gophers would have conserved energy by remaining in their nests in the morning when the burrows were coolest, and may have reduced the risk of hyperthermia by avoiding activity in the late afternoon when burrows were warmest. Because an endogenously controlled circadian metabolic rhythm has never been demonstrated in pocket gophers, the observed pattern of activity was probably environmentally induced. The results suggest that the subterranean microhabitat may require efficient use of both time and energy by its mammalian inhabitants.

DT Article
AB Ornamental traits related to success in male-male competition were studied in red jungle fowl, Gallus gallus. In controlled fights between pairs of males, comb size was the only morphological trait that correlated with winning. Among free-ranging, socially integrated groups of 1-year-old males, body size and comb chroma (degree of saturation with pigment), in addition to comb size, were significantly related to dominance. In jungle fowl, the comb is strongly affected by blood testosterone level, which in turn reflects the current physical condition of the individual.

TI NEST DEFENSE AS SHAREABLE PATERNAL CARE IN RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB One of the costs of female birds of mating polygynously is having to share the parental care provided by their mate. Nest defense, however, is one form of paternal care that females mated to the same male should be able to share. In this study there was no difference in the defence of primary and secondary nests by male red-winged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus. Nests that were provisioned by males were not defended more aggressively than nests that were not provisioned. Nests that were successful had been defended more aggressively by males than those that failed, indicating that male nest defence is valuable to females. These results suggest that male defence is entirely shareable, in contrast to a recent study that showed males preferentially defended nests of primary females (Knight and Temple, Condor, 1988, 90, 193-200). Although the study design used here more realistically reflects natural nest defence (males had to defend one nest at a time rather than having to  choose which of two nests to defend), it does not explain why males preferentially defended certain nests when forced to make a choice but not when defending nests one at a time.

TI REPRODUCTIVE DIVISION OF LABOR RELATED TO AGE IN THE JAPANESE QUEENLESS
   ANT, PRISTOMYRMEX-PUNGENS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In the ant Pristomyrmex pungens, only intranidal workers (which stay inside the nest) reproduce. This paper reports laboratory investigations into the factors differentiating intranidal and extranidal (foraging) workers. All workers begin life as intranidal workers, and later become extranidal workers. Taken over the whole lifespan of individuals, there is no non-reproductive caste in this species. All intranidal workers have active ovaries, but extranidal workers have resorbed ovaries. Thus,  in P. purgens, reproductive division of labour has been reduced and is now related only to age rather than caste. Extranidal workers collected from the field, isolated from intranidal workers and fed to satiation in the laboratory, failed to recover ovarian activity, indicating that once a worker has become extranidal, she cannot return to laying eggs. All individuals thus both work and reproduce in this species in cooperative societies. Parthenogenetic laying of diploid eggs by workers may  be an evolutionary response to the risk of losing a queen in nomadic species such as P. pungens.

TI PATERNAL CARE IN A NEOTROPICAL HARVESTMAN, ZYGOPACHYLUS-ALBOMARGINIS
   (ARACHNIDA, OPILIONES, GONYLEPTIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Males of the tropical harvestman Zygopachylus albomarginis guard eggs inside open mud nests that they build, usurp or occupy if abandoned. They maintain the nests for extended periods by removing fungus, repairing them when damaged, and guarding them from conspecifics and ants. Females wander on tree trunks and visit nests; they actively court males, mate and oviposit inside the nests and then leave. A male guards a nest with eggs of different ages and from different females. This behaviour may be unique among arachnids. There was considerable variation in numbers of eggs that males guard throughout the breeding season. This variability could not be explained in terms of obvious characteristics of nests or males. An experiment in which males were removed from nests showed that nest guarding by males is essential for egg survival. This system has not been described in detail before and remains the only known case of paternal care in arachnids.

TI INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF MATERNAL REJECTION RATES AMONG
   FREE-RANGING RHESUS-MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes evidence for the intergenerational transmission of one aspect of maternal style, rejection rates, among free-ranging rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta. Rejection rates for individual mohters were both reasonably consistent from infant to infant and similar to those of their own mothers. Although rates differed significantly between matrilines, those of individual females more closely resembled those of their mothers than those of other maternal kin. Preliminary data suggest that adult daughters'' scores were more similar to those they observed their mothers apply to their younger siblings than those they experienced directly as infants. Association with the mother after infancy may play an important role in the transmission of rejection rates from mothers to daughters.

TI CULTURAL-EVOLUTION OF MALE SONG TYPES IN DARWIN MEDIUM GROUND FINCHES,
   GEOSPIZA-FORTIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB To examine the patterns and causes of cultural changes in a bird species, the changes in frequency, between-generation transmission, and demographic success of different male song types were studied in a population of Darwin''s medium ground finches, Geospiza fortis, on Isla Daphne Major, Galapagos [Pacific Ocean] over a 6-year period (1979-1984). Males in this population sang one of four simple discrete song types throughout their lifetimes and males with different song types differed in body size. Sons generally sang the same song types as that of their fathers, although the percentage of sons who learned non-paternal song types (25% of all father-son pairs) was higher than previously reported for this population. There were frequency-dependent changes in the relative numbers of different song types over time; the type that was most common at the start of the study declined significantly in frequency over the 6-year period while the three less common types showed equivalent  increases in relative abundance. This non-random pattern of cultural change was at least partially caused by both direct and indirect selection on male song type. Direct selection occurred because males with the less common songs survived longer; this relationship was independent of possible effects of body size on survival. Males with the less common songs also produced more yearling offspring. However, this difference is best explained as an indirect, correlated effect of a positive  relationship between male body size and fecundity. Finally, males with less common songs also produced more sons who recruited to the breeding population, which is indirect evidence that the song type of a young male may influence his chances of becoming a breeder. This demonstration of fitness differences between males with different song types argues that biological and cultural evolution are more closely coupled processes in these birds than in previously studied species.

TI FIGHTING AND ASSESSMENT IN THE NET-SPINNING CADDIS LARVA
   ARCTOPSYCHE-LADOGENSIS - A TEST OF THE SEQUENTIAL ASSESSMENT GAME
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Eight qualitative predictions from the sequential assessment game were tested using netspinning caddisfly larvae Arctopsyche ladogensis which fight over silk retreats and catchnets. The results agree with predictions regarding effects of relative size and ownership. Size was crucial for the outcome of contests, large specimens usually winning. Both contest duration and the standard deviation of contest durations were negatively correlated with the relative size of the opponents. Owners were  more persistant than intruders, and they won most of the contests. In contests where both opponents regarded themselves as owners, contests lasted longer than owner-intruder ones. Contrary to predictions from the sequential assessment game, resource value in terms of amount of silk invested or amount of food obtained in the net did not influence contest outcome or duration. It is concluded that the sequential assessment game predicted the effects of relative size and ownership but not the effects of resource value.

TI EXTRA-PAIR MATING IN THE SPOTTED SANDPIPER - A FEMALE MATE ACQUISITION
   TACTIC
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Extra-pair mating behaviour was studied in the spotted sandpiper, Actitis macularia, a sex-role reversed, polyandrous shorebird, in which females are larger than and socially dominant to males. On a population basis, intra-pair mating events (0.39 events/h) exceeded extra-pair events (0.05 events/h) by about a factor of 10; 15% (N = 26) of extra-pair events were copulations. Extra-pair events were not synchronized with the fertile period of females. Extra-pair mating events were more likely to end in copulations when males were either unpaired or paired to females that had not started laying a clutch compared with males that were incubating or paired to a laying female. Overall, males moved further than females during extra-pair events, but distance moved was associated with male reproductive status. Within each sex, extra-pair events were not randomly distributed among individuals in most years, indicating that few individuals were responsible for most extra-pair events. For both  sexes, extra-pair behavior was correlated with number of breeding attempts annually and was unrelated to individual morphology and breeding experience. Extra-pair events increased the likelihood that females would subsequently pair with the males concerned. It is proposed that extra-pair mating events in spotted sandpipers in part serve the noval function of establishment and maintenance of social relationships that may lead to subsequent pair formation and mate acquisition, a pattern  correlated with the species sex-role reversed mating system.

TI ANTIPREDATOR STRATEGIES OF SALAMANDERS - INDIVIDUAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL
   VARIATION IN RESPONSES OF EURYCEA-BISLINEATA TO SNAKES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Adult two-lined salamanders, Eurycea bislineata, displayed alternative antipredator behaviour to garter snake, Thamnophis oridoides, predators. In response to snake tongue-flicks, individual salamanders either ran, jumped or remained immobile. Different populations and individuals within populations exhibited different propensities for the alternative behaviours. Individuals from an area with a high density of garter snakes ran more often than those from another area. The kind of behaviour  exhibited was also correlated with the physical ability of the salamander. Those individuals that ran in response to garter snake tongue-flicks were able to run faster than those that exhibited immobility. Individual salamanders that run when tongue-flicked by garter snakes accrue a survival advantage over those that remain immobile. The survival advantages of alternative patterns of antipredator behaviour should vary greatly as a function of differing local selection regimens.

TI SEXUAL DIFFERENCES IN HABITAT SELECTION AND ACTIVITY OF THE COLOR
   POLYMORPHIC ISOPOD IDOTEA-BALTICA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In laboratory experiments females of an aquatic isopod Idotea baltica preferred the undersides of stones and Mytilus shells while males preferred the light-green upperparts of bladderwrack (Fucus sp.). Within the sexes, habitat selection was not clearly related to the colour morph. It is suggested that sexual differences in habitat selection may affect the susceptibility of colour morphs to visually searching predators and so contribute to the evolution of sexual dimorphism in colour morph  frequencies in L. baltica. The activity of males remained high during the entire breeding period from May to July, whereas females became inactive just after the deposition of eggs into the brood pouch. Females were more active at night than during the day throughout the summer, but the activity of males during the day increased to the level of that at night by July. This may lead to greater mortality of males in late summer. The reduced activity of gravid females may be a behavioural  adaptation to an increased risk of predation during the incubation period.

TI FIELD EVIDENCE FOR SEXUAL SELECTION AND RESOURCE COMPETITION INFANTICIDE
   IN WHITE-FOOTED MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A field study on infanticide in whie-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, was conducted to (1) determine the effects of sex, reproductive experience and relatedness on the tendency to engage in infanticide, and (2) test three hypotheses for the adaptive significance of infanticide (resource competion, sexual selection and exploitation of young as food source). The incidence of infanticide was determined using specially designed test chambers in a wild population. Infanticide was most commonly  exhibited by resident adult females, immigrating males and resident males that had not sired any offspring. Resident males that had sired offspring did not kill pups within their home ranges, but did kill pups as dispersing males. Thus, infanticide among males was related to confidence of paternity. Forty-three per cent of the pups killed were partially eaten, mostly by pregnant or lactating females. Exploitation of young as a food source may occur opportunistically, but does not appear to be  the main motivation for infanticide. Neither males nor females discriminated between pups based on familiar and unfamiliar scent. The results support the sexual selection hypothesis for males and resource compeititon hypothesis for females.

TI HERITABILITY ESTIMATES AND BEHAVIOR OBSERVATIONS - EXTRA-PAIR MATINGS IN
   INDIGO BUNTINGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB About 2% of 156 behaviourally complete copulations observed in indigo buntings, Passerina cyanea, were extra-pair matings between a female and a male other than her mate. Morphometric similarities between parents and offspring indicated a significant heritability of body size (wing length, h2 .+-. SE = 0.44 .+-. 0.13 offspring and mid-parent values). Females were more similar to their offspring than were their mates. The incidence of effective extra-pair matings was estimated from the difference  of offspring-father and offspring-mother regressions. The morphometric data suggest a much higher incidence of extra-pair fertilizations (40%, with wide error bounds) than did the field observations: males are not always closely related to the offspring produced on their territory. Full siblings were significantly more similar than half-siblings when the half-siblings shared a father, and not when the half-siblings shared a mother. Maternal half-siblings were more similar than paternal  half-siblings, and siblings from the same nest were more similar than siblings from different nests, though not significantly so. Differences in season of birth, natal microhabit (nest plant) and natal brood size did not affect the adult size of the buntings; no environmental traits were discovered that might explain the results as a non-genetic maternal effect. The approximately tenfold difference in the incidence of observed extra-pair copulations and of extra-pair fertilizations estimated by quantitative genetic methods is similar to the difference reported in other observational and protein electrophoretic studies in the same population.

TI PHYSIOLOGICAL COSTS OF BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES FOR MALE CHEETAHS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In adult cheetahs, Acinonyx jubatus, some males compete fiercely for access to territories, become residents and encounter females within territories, while others seek out females in the course of a nomadic existence. This study shows that non-resident male cheetahs are in poor health compared to resident males based on examination of their body condition and haematological measures. Non-residents are both behaviourly and physiologically stressed compared to residents. They not only spend a  lower per cent of time in exposed resting places and more time alert than residents, but they also have raised cortisol levels, suggesting behavioural differences associated with their status may contribute to their poor physical condition.

   PARAGNETINA-MEDIA (PLECOPTERA, PERLIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Few studies have considered whether cryptic coloration is protective. As a model predator/prey system, the visually foraging fish rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, and the stonefly nymph were used to hexamine cryptic coloration and anti-predator behaviour of prey. In both the laboratory and field, stonefly nymphs selected dark substrates on which they were inconspicuous and therefore less vulnerable to predation by trout. In the laboratory, substrate colour selection by nymphs ceased  approximately 2 h after the lights were turned off but resumed within 1 h of lights being turned on. Stoneflies also selected dark patches, rather than light, on the surface of multi-coloured substrate. Colour selection behaviour was not different in the presence versus absence of trout. Stoneflies perceived colour through a combination of visual input from their compound eyes and ocelli.

TI THE ONTOGENY OF FORAGING IN SQUIRREL-MONKEYS, SAIMIRI-OERSTEDI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of foraging and locomotor independence by wild infant squirrel monkeys is described. Infants began to locomote independently during the fourth week of life and successful foraging appeared within the next 2 weeks. Infants were weaned by 16 weeks. The frequency and targets of foraging activities in infants became indistinguishable from those of older animals within 4.5 months after the onset of foraging, with four exceptions. Compared with older animals, infants exhibited (1)  greater reliance on methods that did not involve prehension of small prey, (2) less visual inspection of potential foraging sites, (3) less skilled processing of certain prey to remove potentially toxic gut contents and to prevent escape, and (4) less avoidance of urticaceous caterpillars. Observations of infants watching other infants experiencing difficulties with noxious prey and prevention of approach to noxious prey by adults suggest that avoidance of certain species could be transmitted  socially. Otherwise, no direct social influence on foraging was shown. Only a few features of foraging require extensive individually acquired motor skills, and weanlings can feed themselves adequately before these skills are developed. Infants in the wild population were weaned much earlier than has been observed in captive groups, and at about the age at which abilities are sufficiently mature for foraging to reach minimal efficiency. The age of weaning in this population probably represents  the lower limit of this taxon.

TI THE IMPLICATIONS OF DIVERGENCE IN SPATIAL NESTING PATTERNS IN THE
   GEMINATE CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC SERGEANT MAJOR DAMSELFISHES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male Caribbean Abudefduf saxatilis, and Pacific, A. troschelii, sergeant majors nest in colonies, but nest densities in the Pacific are much greater than in the Caribbean. The relatively dense within-colony aggregations in the Pacific have apparently been favoured by the screening effects of defence by peripheral males against foraging groups of the wrasse, Thalassoma lucasanum, resulting in lower rates of predation on embryos guarded by males with centrally placed nests. Males with centrally placed nests were also more likely to spawn successfully than were those with peripheral nests, suggesting that aggregated nesting has been further reinforced by female preferences for males with nests in which risk of predation on embryos is lowest. In the Caribbean, where similar predation on embryos was absent, relatively slight within-colony spatial aggregation of nesting was observed. This tendency might be maintained by female preferences for males with close nearest-neighbour  distances because males that failed to spawn had longer nearest-neighbour distances than those that did spawn, but the difference was only marginally significant. Alternatively, because the Caribbean and Pacific species are thought to have been derived from a single population following the uplift of the isthmus of Panama, it is possible that spatial aggregation represents a residual tendency, originally favoured by selection under ancestral conditions.

TI ENIGMATIC COHABITATION IN BOWL AND DOILY SPIDERS, FRONTINELLA-PYRAMITELA
   (ARANEAE, LINYPHIIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Although some spiders are social and associate in groups for long periods of time, most are solitary, coming together only to court and mate, and then only for a very brief time. Among solitary web-building spiders, adult males typically cease web construction and become vagabonds while adult femles continue their web-borne lives, at some time(s) hosting and mating with the wandering males. The visits of male bowl and doily spiders to females'' webs are highly variable in duration and much longer, usually, than the time required for courtship and mating. This study attempted to determine what variables were responsible for the large variability in cohabitation durations in bowl and doily spiders, and why cohabitations were prolonged beyond the time necessary for copulation. Female identity, female reproductive status (i.e. virginity), presence or absence of a female, time of day, relative humidity, recent intrusion by a second male, and recent prey capture by the male were tested. Only the first and last of these influenced, though mildly, the duration of cohabitations, and none of these variables could account for the large variability in cohabitation durations. Further analysis of the data showed that the departures of males from females'' webs were governed by stochastic processes within the spiders, not by responses to environmental variables or to individual histories. These processes are readily modelled by a pair of die-rolling strategies, one apparently resident in the male and the other a product of the interaction of both male and female.

TI ANNOUNCING INTENT - THE AGGRESSIVE STATE OF MUSTH IN AFRICAN ELEPHANTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Predictions derived from game theory suggest that animals should not signal their intentions during conflict situations. However, during the period of musth, male elephants, Loxodonta africana, announce a state of heightened aggression with signals that are unbluffable. Since smaller musth males in poor condition are able to dominant larger, normally higher-ranking, non-musth males in good condition, musth provides a useful system with which to examine the possibility of honest signalling of motivation, rather than of fighting ability. Despite the highly aggressive state of male in musth, esclated contests are extremely rare. The behaviour of musth and non-musth males suggests that opponents are able to estimate their often rapidly changing roles in the asymmetries with relatively accuracy. Since, unlike most other rutting mammals, elephants have asynchronous sexually active periods, resource value varies both with age and the fluctuating sexual state of a particular individual. It is suggested that musth may be a case where information about resource value is conveyed.

TI COPULATION BEHAVIOR OF THE OSPREY PANDION-HALIAETUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Copulation patterns in the osprey, based on an exceptionally complete data set, are described. Ospreys copulated frequently, on average 160 times in per clutch (range: 88-338), but only 39% of copulations resulted in cloacal contact. Pairs averaged 59 successful copulations per clutch, starting 14 days before, and peaking in the few days before the start of egg laying. Copulation occurred most often in the early morning, at the same time as egg laying. Female ospreys spent almost all their time  (more than 95%) at the nest and were fed there by the male. There was no association between courtship feeding and copulation, and hence no evidence that females traded copulations for food. Males maximized the time they spent at the nest with the female just prior to and during egg laying. Extra-pair courtship and copulation occurred and the results support the idea that in species with substantial paternal investment males should also invest heavily in paternity assurance. Male ospreys protect their paternity by frequent copulation and by maximizing their time with the female when she is most fertile.

TI THE EFFECT OF FAMILIARITY ON SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN MEADOW VOLES,
   MICROTUS-PENNSYLVANICUS - A LABORATORY AND FIELD-STUDY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of familiarity in affecting the outcome of social interactions among meadow voles was investigated in both a laboratory and a field experiment. In the laboratory, captive meadow voles. Microtus pennsylvanicus, were exposed to a conspecific''s odour. The voles were then placed into two groups:famililar unfamiliar. Familiar voles were individuals who underwent staged dyadic encounters with the conspecific to whose odours they had been exposed. unfamiliar voles were individuals who  underwent paired encounters with conspecifics to whose odours they had not been exposed. In the field experiment, familiar voles were neighbours that were trapped within each othre''s home ranges over two consecutive bi-weekly trapping sessions. Unfamiliar voles were individuals that were trapped on different trapping grids. The results of the laboratory and field studies were similar. Encounters between familiar females resulted in less agonistic behavior and more amicable acts than encounters  between unfamiliar females. In contrast, encounters between familiar males resulted in more agonistic behaviour than encounters between unfamiliar males. Familarity did not affect the outcome of male-female interactions. These results are discussed in the framework of the social system of the meadow vole.

TI THE VACANCY CHAIN PROCESS - A NEW MECHANISM OF RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION IN
   ANIMALS WITH APPLICATION TO HERMIT CRABS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A number of resources important to humans such as jobs in bureaucracies, houses and apartments are allocated through a mechanism known as a vacancy chain. In a vacancy chain process an initial, vacant resource unit entering a population of users is taken by a first individual who leaves his/her previous resource unit behind, which is taken by a second individual, and so on. In this process an initial resource unit works both directly and indirectly to provide opportunities for several  individuals to gain new and better resources. Vacancy chains are hypothesized to be important in resource distribution for a variety of non-human animals, and it is documented, in particular, that the hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus gets the gastropod shells in which it lives through this mechanism. The direct and indirect effects of vacancy chains on hermit crabs and the systematic ways in which chains flow through groups of crabs and their resources are indicated. In systems where they  occur, it is further hypothesized that vacancy chains have unique implications for the ecology of resource users. Several of these hypotheses are explored using the example of hermit crabs.

TI MALE MONARCH BUTTERFLY SPERMATOPHORE MASS AND MATING STRATEGIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus, produce a spermatophore which can represent approximately 10% of their body mass. Spermatophore mass increased with age in virgin males, and with the time since last mating in non-virgin males. Male monarchs did not delay re-mating until they were able to produce a large spermatophore. Recently mated males were as likely as virgins to copulate with both virgin and non-virgin females. Monarchs provide an example of Bateman''s principle, mating  whenever possible, despite the non-trivial cost involved.

TI SEXUAL SELECTION IN PINYON JAYS .1. FEMALE CHOICE AND MALE-MALE
   COMPETITION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Although pinyon jays, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus, mate monogamously and male parental investment is high, the mechanisms of sexual selection occur in this species. Experiments were performed using captive birds to determine which male traits are favored by female choice and which are favored by inter-male competition. Females mated preferentially with males that were brighter in color and had larger testes. Females did not prefer large males, but inter-male competition favored males with larger bills and heavier bodies. Male dominance was not the primary determinant of male mating success, but it probably conferred an advantage.

TI SEXUAL DICHROMATISM AND PARASITISM IN BRITISH AND IRISH FRESH-WATER FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Hamilton and Zuk (1982) predicted that there should be a relationship between a species'' parasite load and its sexual showiness. The relationship between the number of parasite genera reported from a fish family and its sexual dichromatism was examined in British and Irish freshwater fish. Eleven other ecological and life history variables which may also cause sexual dichromatism were also examined. The changes in appearance that take place are always more marked in males and occur only  during the breeding season. This strongly implicates sexual seleciton as an important selective determinant. There was a significant positive correlation between a fish family''s sexual dichromatism and the number of parasite genera reported from it. This remained significant when the influences of near-significantly correlated ecological and life history variables were removed. Using more detailed published parasite data on six species, there was also a significant correlation between the mean  number of parasite species per host individual and host sexual dichromatism. These results support Hamilton and Zuk''s bright, parasite-resistant male and choosy female hypothesis.

TI THE EFFECT OF BODY SIZE ON MALE COURTSHIP SUCCESS IN A PLETHODONTID
   SALAMANDER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two different sets of courtship encounters between female Desmoganthus ochrophaeus and males of large (.hivin.X = 58 mm) and small (.hivin.X = 38 mm) body size were staged in the laboratory. In the first set, encounters were arranged between male-female pairs so that each of five females individually encountered each of 10 males. In these encounters, small and large males were equally likely to court with and inseminate females. In the second set, each encountered was staged for a trio of one female and two males (one large and one small); each female had a courtship opportunity with five large-small pairs of males, and each pair of males encountered five different females. In the 25 trio encounters, the large male always chased away the small male before proceeding to court the female. Small males never deposited spermatophores if a large male was present. Male body size should have a significant effect on courtship success in natural populations of D. ochrophaeus if male-male competition affects access to females.

TI WHY DO MIGRATING ROBINS, ERITHACUS-RUBECULA, CAPTURED AT 2 NEARBY
   STOP-OVER SITES ORIENT DIFFERENTLY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The orientation of robins captured during autumn and spring migration at two different sites, Falsterbo and Ottenby, in southern Sweden was investigated by cage experiments during the twilight period after sunset. The robins were tested under clear skies with skylight from sunset visible, and under simulated total overcast. The robins from the two sites differed in orientation, especially during autumn migration. While robins from Ottenby generally oriented in their expected migratory  direction, the birds from Falsterbo under clear skies oriented towards the sunset direction with a narrow scatter in individual mean headings. Under simulated total overcast the robins from Falsterbo preferred northerly directions in autumn. Short-distance recoveries, one or only a few days after ringing, show that robins in autumn regularly fly 20-80 km from Falsterbo on northerly courses, indicating that they have temporarily reoriented from their normal migratory direction when confronted  with the Baltic Sea. In contrast, most robins arrive at Ottenby by extensive flights across the Baltic Sea, and rapidly continue their sea crossing in the normal migratory directions. Mean fat deposits in autumn robins were significantly larger at Ottenby than at Falsterbo. These results indicate that migrating birds may show markedly different orientational dispositions depending on body condition and on their situation with respect to preceding and impending migration over land and sea, respectively.

TI 2 CONFLICTING NEEDS AFFECTING PREDATOR MOBBING BY GREAT TITS,
   PARUS-MAJOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Predator mobbing by great tits, Parus major, was studied by manipulating two contextual variables: the proximity of danger to the nest hole (close versus far), and breeding condition (non-breeding versus nest building versus care of nestlings). In five experiments pitting these contextual variables against each other, great tits were presented with a multi-species mobbing chorus signalling danger to which they responded by typical predator harassment. Based on the ''move on'' hypothesis of  harassment and on context manipulation, harassment levels specific for each of the five experiments could be predictably ordered; the ensuing rank order of scores reflected, by its nature, a series of four strong inference tests. Whereas two latency measures supported the move on hypothesis, two distance-from-danger measures suggested nest hole concealment to be an opposing need; a fifth measure of harassment, comprising both latency and distance, held an intermediate position, thus tying in with the compromise nature of harassment. Considering the ''phantom'' nature of the unseen danger stimulus applied, the defence levels observed must be regarded as moderately conservative. There are natural danger stimuli (e.g. cats) that more effectively prevent great tits displaying predator harassment.

TI MATE CHOICE BY MARSH WRENS - THE INFLUENCE OF MALE AND TERRITORY QUALITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB If females choose breeding situations to maximize their fitness, then those features of the male and/or territory that are important in mate selection by females should affect female fitness, be assessable prior to mating, and vary among males. The purpose of this study was to identify characteristics of male quality and territory quality that fit these criteria for marsh wrens Cistothorus palustris. The male''s contribution to nest defence appeared not to affect female success or choice. However, females that received male assistance with feeding young produced more and heavier fledglings than females without assistance. Males that fed young did not attract more mates. Few males in this population fed young, and no relationship was found between feeding effort and physical or behavioural features of the male. Results of multivariate analyses suggest that, within sites, the measures of territory quality used here cannot explain the variance in the number of young fledged per female or male harem size. The examination of arbitrary territories showed that male pairing success, female settlement order and predation patterns were not significantly correlated between years. The results suggest that territory quality does not influence female success or choice. These results are discussed in the light of earlier attempts to relate features of males and territories to mate selection by female passerines.

TI POLYGYNY IN THE YELLOW-HEADED BLACKBIRD - FEMALE CHOICE VERSUS MALE
   COMPETITION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Several assumptions and predictions of the polygyny threshold and sexy son hypotheses, which were proposed to explain the maintenance of polygyny on the basis of female choice, were examined. An alternative neutral mate choice hypothesis in which male competition is responsible for polygyny was also examined. For the yellow-headed blackbird, Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus, neither territory nor male features affected female choice of mate or female reproductive success. In the study  population, polygyny occurred because males competed to hold territories in order to gain access to females. Since females settled apparently randomly, males that were more aggressive and were therefore able to secure large territories had larger harems. Several criteria must be met in order for the neutral mate choice hypothesis to apply. Evidence from the literature suggests that for some species the criteria are not met and polygyny occurs due to female choice. However, several studies provide evidence that the neutral mate choice hypothesis may apply in some populations.

TI REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR AND GENDER ALLOCATION IN SERRANUS-FASCIATUS, A
   HERMAPHRODITIC REEF FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior and reproductive biology of Serranus fasciatus, hermaphroditic reef fish, was investigated to elucidate the relationship between its unusual gender-allocation pattern and its mating behavior. All individuals start life as simultaneous hermaphrodites, but the largest individuals in any location lose female function and become functional males. Males maintain permanent territories which contain one-eight hermaphrodites that they defend against other males. Males obtain high levels of mating success by pair-spawning with hermaphrodites within their harem. Hermaphrodites obtain low levels of male mating success through streaking, in which an individual joins a spawning pair and releases sperm, an alternative male mating tactic. Alternative male mating strategies are rare in other haremic reef fishes, but exist as a facultative strategy in hermaphroditic S. fasciatus, which obtain most of their mating success through female function. The absence of this gender-allocation pattern in socially similar species of reef fishes may be due to the spatial predictability and concentration of spawning in these species, which can favor alternative non-aggressive male mating tactics. However, the rarity of this complex pattern is probably also due to evolutionary constraints of the development of simultaneous hermaphroditism in other species.

TI FIELD-TESTS OF THE ACCURACY OF ESTIMATING PREY SIZE FROM BILL LENGTH IN
   OYSTERCATCHERS, HAEMATOPUS-OSTRALEGUS, EATING MUSSELS, MYTILUS-EDULIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Field test were made of the accuracy with which different observers estimated the size of mussels, Mytilus edulis, being eaten by oystercatchers, Haematopus ostralegus. Mussel size was estimated by eye by comparing their lengths with that of the bird''s bill. Test of bias were made in two ways. A ''natural'' test involved comparing the estimated sizes of prey taken by free-living birds with the lengths of the emptied shells they left on the mussel bed. A ''model'' test involved estimating mussel size against the bill of a model oystercatcher. Though one observer showed no bias, the other three overestimated the lengths of large mussels and underestimated those of small ones. The magnitude of bias differed significantly between observers and, to a lesser degree, between the natural and model tests. Because of the curvilinear relationship between prey length and energy content, a bias of the magnitude found in this study could, in extreme cases, lead to serious errors in estimating a prey''s energy content. It is concluded that, in studies where prey is measured against bill length, an observer''s individual bias should always be measured, preferable by the natural method. If this is not possible, then tests of the robustness of the conclusions should be made by recalculating the data assuming worst case errors.

   SONG SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Possession of a territory is essential to successful reproduction in male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia. However, the aggressive behaviour of territory owners frequently prevents some males from settling. Several factors that might affect the ability of territory owners to defend their territories against intrusion by non-territorial ''floater'' males were investigated. Floaters lived secretively on the territories of owners, but were only occasionally detected by them. During consecutive breeding seasons, intrusions were most frequently observed on the territories of birds older or younger than 2 or 3 years. As males aged, intrusion pressure on their territories changed as predicted by patterns observed within seasons. Males experienced similar intrusion pressure in each year with respect to the means of their age classes. However intrusion pressure on the same territory was not correlated across years, nor across different owners of a territory within years. Intrusion pressure was therefore an attribute of males rather than of territories. Males that experienced high intrusion pressure held territories for shorter periods, and they sometimes possessed handicaps that decreased their ability to evict floaters. Two- and 3-year-old males held their territories longest. Intrusion pressure was unrelated to floater density, territory size, to whether a female was present on the territory, or to the fertility of territorial females. This study shows that floaters intrude selectively against particular males, and that the ability to defend a territory against floaters first increases and then decreases with age in male song sparrows.

TI THE VERTEBRATE-CATCHING BEHAVIOR OF THE FISHING SPIDER DOLOMEDES-TRITON
   (ARANEAE, PISAURIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study shows that the semiaquatic spider Dolomedes triton (Araneae, Pisauridae) used water surface waves to detect and localize aquatic and semiaquatic vertebrate prey. In rare cases, prey capture attempts were also triggered by hydrodynamic flow fields generated by a fish swimming close below the water surface. Visual stimuli alone were not used for identification and localization of prey. Concentric water surface waves are produced whenever a fish, frog, or tadpole contacts the water surface (e.g. in order to breather or feed). D. triton could localize the centre of a concentric fish-generated wave stimulus very precisely up to a distance of at least 18 cm. However, the rate of success (fish captured) was only 9% if the stimulus triggering prey capture behaviour was a water surface wave. In the case of direct incidental contact, this value increased to 16%. D. triton could catch fish that were as much as 4.5 times heavier than the spider itself. Wave stimuli caused by fish, frogs and tadpoles had a small frequency bandwitdth with an upper frequency limit rarely exceeding 30-40 Hz. In most cases these stimuli lasted less than 1 s. The mean peak-to-peak amplitude of vertebrate-generated surface waves varied between at least 100 .mu.m (guppy) and 745 .mu.m (goldfish). Both in the time and frequency domain, wave stimuli caused by aquatic and semiaquatic vertebrates were difficult to distinguish from abiotic noise stimuli (i.e. stimuli caused by leaf, seed or twig fall). This may be the reason why Dolomedes responded to less than 1% of fish-generated water surface waves with prey capture attempts.

TI WATER VIBRATION ELICITS ACTIVE ANTENNAL MOVEMENTS IN THE CRAYFISH,
   ORCONECTES-LIMOSUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Antennal movements in freshwater crayfish elicited by water vibration were analysed with respect to the reliability of the reactions and to the direction and degree of the antennal sweeps. Antennal sweeps were the first reactions to occur in response to stimulation by water vibration. If both antennae were moving, the one ipsilateral to the stimulus usually moved towards the stimulus: the contralateral one moved forwards or backwards with equal probability without an obvious relationship to the  stimulus direction. The angles through which the antennae swept were in the range of 20-50 degrees of arc. Stimulation of extero-mechanoreceptors on the whole surface of the crayfish by direct touch typically caused backwards movement of the ipsilateral antenna and a forwards movement of the contralateral antenna. Only touching the tailfan resulted in a different behavioural reaction of the contralateral antenna, which then moved with equal frequency forwards and backwards as on stimulation by water vibration. A mathematical model indicates that as an antenna sweeps past a moving object it goes through a ''cone of silence'', i.e., a region of minimal stimulation. It is proposed that this phenomenon helps a crayfish localize moving objects.

TI FLUCTUATIONS IN PREY DENSITY - EFFECTS ON THE FORAGING TACTICS OF
   SCOLOPENDRID CENTIPEDES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Foraging animals are faced with the problem of acquiring information about prey populations and utilizing that information in making foraging decisions. In this paper the effect of variation in prey density on the search tactics and mechanisms of prey density assessment in the centipede Scolopendra polymorpha are examined. Centipedes exhibited a prey density-dependent repertoire of search tactics. After 50 min of exposure to high prey density, centipedes switched from active search to ambush-like tactics, while maintaining a high rate of search at the lowest prey density. An initial period of sampling of prey density was involved in the switch in search behaviour and it is suggested that the encounter rate with prey was the key element in density assessment. When the prey density was changed from low to high, centipedes switched from active search to ambush tactics and when prey density was changed from high to low centipedes switched from ambush to active search within 40 min. Such behaviour may decrease the unreliability of sampling information and the risk involved in foraging decisions in variable environments.

TI THE ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR IN BREEDING
   BUFFLEHEADS - A TEST OF 3 HYPOTHESES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Waterfowl show considerable variability in their degree of territoriality. In this study, the adaptive significance of territorial behaviour in buffleheads, Bucephala albeola, a highly territorial species, was investigated. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) the territory secures food resources for the laying female (food hypothesis), (2) the territory provides undisturbed feeding time for the female and ensures paternity (mate-guarding hypothesis), (3) the territory protects the nest  site (nest site hypothesis). Contrary to predictions of the food hypothesis, territory size was not inversely related to food abundance in the territory, and food was correlated to only two of five measures of reproductive success: females started laying earlier and clutch weight was slightly higher (but only in one year) on territories with more food. When males were removed during the egg-laying period, neighbouring males behaved aggressively toward widowed females and they usually evicted these females from their territory. Widowed females spent less time feeding and more time alert. Females tended to use a territory adjacent to the nest, and those that did not do so suffered a higher rate of nest parasitism. Thus mate guarding may be a major function of territorial behaviour in buffleheads. Protection of the nest site may further explain why bufflehead territories are more site-specific than those of other territorial ducks.

TI ACQUISITION OF TERRITORIES BY FLOATERS IN COOPERATIVELY BREEDING PURPLE
   GALLINULES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The manner in which new territories were acquired in a population of cooperatively breeding purple gallinules, Porphyrula martinica, was examined. At the beginning of the study, four gallinule territories occupied a 3-ha pond and many birds in the population were non-breeding, non-territorial ''floaters''. As an experiment, the pond was allowed to fill in with vegetation, creating more breeding habitat for the gallinules. By the end of the study, there were 11 gallinule territories and very few  floaters on the pond. New territories were acquired by pairs, all of which formed from birds that had been floaters. The pairs set up territories either in segments of existing territories or in previously unoccupied ares. One breeding vacancy occurred during the study and it was filled promptly by an unpaired floater. Helpers departed from their natal territories when they became adults. Most disappeared from the study site, and three returned after several months. The returning birds became  floaters. Three birds that had been helpers became breeders during the study. Helping and floating are viewed as age-related responses of purple gallinules to the ecological constraint of limited habitat availability.

TI INTEGRATED USE OF MOON AND MAGNETIC COMPASSES BY THE HEART-AND-DART
   MOTH, AGROTIS-EXCLAMATIONIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Use of the moon as a compass during migration appears difficult due to the complexity of the moon''s change in azimuth during the lunar month. These apparent difficulties would be eased if the moon''s position were calibrated at intervals against a constant reference source, such as the geomagnetic field. Yet, until now, no animal has been shown to integrate moon and magnetic compasses for orientation. In this study, light-traps were used on 15 nights during a lunar month to obtain samples of  heart-and-dart moths, Agrotis exclamationis, characterized by a preference to fly ''toward'' (i.e. .+-. 90.degree.) the moon''s azimuth. The compass orientation of each sample was then tested in normal and reversed geomagnetic fields, out of sight of the moon. Compass orientation relative to the ambient magnetic field coincided with the compass bearing of the moon at the time of capture. Directional preference changed during the lunar month in a way that tracked the change in the moon''s azimuth. It is concluded that moths use the geomagnetic field to calibrate a moon compass.

TI INTRASPECIFIC EGG DESTRUCTION IN MARSH WRENS - A STUDY OF MECHANISMS
   PREVENTING FILIAL OVICIDE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Marsh wrens, Cistothorus palustris, attack the nests of other birds, including conspecifics. The tendency of wrens to attack conspecific nests raises the question: what prevents breeding individuals from destroying their own offspring? In this study the mechanisms that prevent filial ovicide (i.e. the destruction of eggs by parents) are examined. The results suggest that male filial ovicide is prevented by the presence of a female in the nest area, which presumably inhibits the male''s  ovicidal tendencies. In addition, incubating females aggressively exclude males from their breeding area, thereby further reducing the threat to their nest. Female filial ovicide is prevented through the inhibition of intraspecific nest-destroying behaviour in breeding females and through the ability of individual females to recognize their own nest site and nest. Differences between the intraspecific nest-destroying behaviour of male and female marsh wrens may reflect different reproductive strategies of the two sexes.

TI SOCIAL GROOMING IN THE COMMON VAMPIRE BAT, DESMODUS-ROTUNDUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Grooming patterns among 65 common vampire bats in hollow tree day roosts were studied by behavioural sampling techniques during a 15-month period. Self-grooming occurred more than social grooming in response to ectoparasites since the proportion of time spent self-grooming and the amount of ectoparasite infestation covaried positively among tree roosts, while the time spent grooming others was independent of roost and ectoparasite level. Rates of social grooming were not independent of the sex of participants due to infrequent social grooming by adult males. Two variables, the level of relatedness and a measure of roosting association, which previously were shown to predict food sharing by regurgitation, correlated positively with the rate of social grooming. Since social grooming occurred more often than expected before a regurgitation and correlated with regurgitation frequency, it is suggested that this behaviour facilitates identification of food sharing partners by enabling a grooming bat to monitor other animal''s potential for giving or receiving blood.

TI COURTSHIP FEEDING IN DROSOPHILA-SUBOBSCURA .1. THE NUTRITIONAL
   SIGNIFICANCE OF COURTSHIP FEEDING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB By feeding male Drosophila subobscura with stained yeast before courtship it was shown that the males transfer regurgitated crop contents to females during courtship. The female takes the drop of food with her proboscis directly from the male''s extended proboscis and the male then attempts to copulate. The food passes into the female crop or ventriculus and females that take the drop have higher fecundity on a low-nutrient medium than those females denied access to the drop. ''Starved'' females  take the drop of food from the male more frequently than well-fed females and a comparison of crop sizes revealed that flies collected from the wild resemble the starved laboratory groups. Similar courtship feeding behaviours are described for other members of the obscura species group. Within the willistoni species group, male D. nebulosa deposit an anal drop containing gut contents on the substrate in front of the female during courtship and females consume this drop. A review of the literature suggests that various forms of courtship feeding may be widespread within the genus but that the extent of feeding by males of different species may vary.

TI OPTIMAL TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN COMPETING BEHAVIORAL DEMANDS IN THE GREAT TIT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB We present a dynamic optimal control model to show how territorial male great tits (Parus major L.) should combine territorial vigilance with foraging. In the model, territory owners allocate time either to feeding in patches or travelling between them. Travelling is compatible with territorial vigilance, while feeding is not. Owners are assumed to adjust their patch residence and travel times in order to minimize the costs accruing from intruders on their territories, while at the same time reducing their hunger. The relation between patch residence and travel time matches that of Charnov''s(1976) marginal value theorem while hunger is high, but as hunger is reduced the dynamic model predicts shorter patch residence times for any observed travel time. We present supporting evidence from an experiment test with captive male great tits.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Differences in dominance rank among red deer (Cervus elaphus) females (hinds) on Rhum were related to their breeding success as well as to the comparative success of male and female offspring. Males (stags) born to mothers above median rank were more successful than hinds, while hinds born to subordinate mothers were more successful than stags. The ratio of male to female calves produced by dominant mothers was significantly higher than that produced by subordinates. Since dominance rank among hinds is related to their body weight as adults and to their birth weight, these results suggest that the birth sex ratio may be affected by environmental factors operating during a female''s early development.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB Ragworms Platynereis dumerilii are periodically active even when they are kept under constant conditions in the laboratory but patterns of activity are modified by changes in prevailing conditions and by sudden stimulation. Acts, or the motivational systems to which they belong, apparently vie with one another for ongoing priority during bouts of activity. There is evidence that they are organized in a dominance hierarchy which ensures that those acts that demand urgent action, such as  predator escape, have priority over less urgent ones. A dominant act can, as a result of a change in its associated level of causal factors, interrupt and replace a subdominant rival as the ongoing behavior.

TI COURTSHIP AND MALE DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN VIRGIN AND MATED FEMALES IN
   THE ORANGE TIP BUTTERFLY ANTHOCHARIS-CARDAMINES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent evidence implies that male butterflies incur non-trivial costs in producing ejaculate, and that the number of ejaculates they can produce is limited. Therefore males should be expected to show some mate discrimination. In butterflies, the reproductive value of females, by necessity, decreases with age and, therefore, males should be expected to court young virgin females more intensively than old mated females. In the orange tip butterfly, Anhocharis cardamines, we show that males exhibit behaviour consonant with this hypthesis. They court unreceptive virgin females for approximately 60 s before giving up, whereas unreceptive mated females are courted for only about 3 s before the male departs. We also show that receptive virgin females usually detain courting males by performing an ''elevated abdomen'' display for about 4 s before accepting the male, and that this display is identical in form to that used by mated females to reject courting males.

TI EVIDENCE FOR SEARCH IMAGE IN BLACKBIRDS (TURDUS-MERULA L) - SHORT-TERM
   LEARNING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A search image is acquired as a result of a change in the ability of a predator to detect cryptic familiar prey. Blackbirds were presented with artificial prey dyed either to match the color of the background (cryptic prey) or to contrast with the background (conspicuous prey). The results of experiment 1 provide some evidence that 10 wild blackbirds had more difficulty detecting cryptic prey than conspicuous prey. Detailed analysis of experiments 2 (11 wild blackbirds) and 3 (6 captive  blackbirds) revealed subtle changes in the reactions of the birds to cryptic prey. At 1st these birds were unable to detect cryptic prey, but subsequently improved their ability to detect such food. This short-term change is interpreted as evidence for search images.

TI A COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE MATING SYSTEM OF DROSOPHILA-HYDEI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Drosophila hydei mating system characteristics were studied and compared to what has been observed for 2 other Drosophila spp. D. hydei females will copulate when they are 3 days old, while males do not exhibit courtship behavior until they are 9 days old. Unlike any other Drosophila, D. hydei females will re-mate as often as 4 times in 1 morning. However, re-mating in the same morning does not increase the number of progeny a female produces. Male D. hydei appear to deal with the continual receptivity of females and the pressures of sperm competition by passing less material to any given female but maintaining a constant level of fertility across numerous successive copulations. D. hydei is a cosmopolitan species which utilizes a wide variety of resources. As in D. melanogaster, another cosmopolitan species which is not closely related to it, male success appears to be dependent upon genetic quality only. This pattern differs from that observed in its relative D. mojavensis, a cactiphilic species endemic to the Sonoran desert, in which males contribute material benefits to females in their ejaculate.

TI BEHAVIORAL INTERACTIONS AND ACTIVITY OF CAPTIVE ELEDONE-MOSCHATA -
   LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS OF A SOCIAL OCTOPUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Because it is found aggregated in its normal environment and is tolerant of the presence of conspecifics in the laboratory, Eledone has been designated as a ''social'' octopus. Behavioral observations of Eledone moschata confirmed that individuals interacted often, did not always move away from one another when touched and did not often withdraw into available shelters. However, E. moschata also formed a size-based dominance hierarchy, as do several species of Octopus in captivity. This  parallel may mean that the apparent differences in social organization of octopods are quantitative rather than qualitative.

TI SPECIES RECOGNITION IN DARWIN FINCHES (GEOSPIZA, GOULD) .3.
   MALE-RESPONSES TO PLAYBACK OF DIFFERENT SONG TYPES, DIALECTS AND
   HETEROSPECIFIC SONGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The songs of the 6 different species of Darwin''s ground finches [Geospiza fuliginosa, G. fortis, G. scandens, G. magnirostris, G. difficilis, G. conirostris] on the Galapagos Islands are difficult to distinguish unambiguously because of high levels of intraspecific variation and interspecific similarity in some cases. Responses of males on 5 islands to playback of the 2 main conspecific song types, A nd B, local conspecific and heterospecific song, and local and foreign dialects were recorded. Males reacted equally strongly to different conspecific song types (A and B), but responded significantly more strongly to local conspecific song than to either heterospecific song or foreign dialect. These results are inconsistent with earlier suggestsions that song types subdivide Geospiza populations and that Geospiza song lacks species-distinctness because of loss-of-contrast or character convergence. The apparent paradox of low song specificity and well-developed acoustic discrimination is discussed in the light of other data showing that close-range species recognition also depends on visual cues.

TI RECIPROCAL EGG TRADING AND BROOD CARE IN A HERMAPHRODITIC POLYCHAETE
   WORM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Ophryotrocha diadema is a simultaneous hermaphrodite polychaete worm with a brief protandrous phase. Its mating behavior was investigated in order to elucidate the relationships between mating system and reproductive biology. A genetically determined yellow or white coloration of the eggs and body walls made it possible to distinguish the egg releaser from the fertilizer. The following main features of the mating system were established: pairs are formed preferentially between simultaneous hermaphrodites, 1 partner releasing eggs and the other fertilizing them. There is no selfing; the partners attain spawning synchronization by means of close mutual contact during a fairly time-consuming courtship; partners regularly alternate sex roles, usually with the same partner more than once in succession; both partners care for their eggs and protect cocoons of neglected eggs spawned by other pairs.

TI FORAGING TACTICS OF AN AQUATIC INSECT - PARTIAL CONSUMPTION OF PREY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Optimal patch foraging theory has recently been used to model partial consumption of prey by predators. Several predictions of this model were tested with larvae of the predaceous diving beetle Dytiscus verticalis, which are predators of anuran tadpoles. Results supported the qualitative predictions of the model. The prediction of decreasing search time with increasing prey density was confirmed. Handling time and the amount ingested per prey item also decreased with decreasing search time. A quantitative test of the optimal foraging model revealed that it accurately predicted handling times when prey densities were high but failed to do so at low prey densities. Two hypotheses based on mean extraction rates are proposed in an attempt to explain these results.

TI THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENCES IN BODY SIZE ON THE MALE TERRITORIAL SYSTEM OF
   THE FLY DRYOMYZA-ANILIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB D. anilis males defend carcasses, the oviposition sites for females. On carcasses < 100 g in weight, a single male establishes a territory. The sex ratio at carcasses is male-biased. Territorial males are larger than other males on average and move more and attack other males more frequently than non-territorial males do. Large carcasses attract more males than smaller ones but the largest males do not choose the largest carcasses. A territorial male is more likely to capture an arriving female, but the advantage of territorial behavior decreases with increasing density of males. Copulating males are significantly larger than average males, but smaller than territorial males, suggesting that some non-territorial males have access to females. Males seem to be able to assess a female''s egg load and to adjust the duration of copulation accordingly.

TI SOCIAL-DOMINANCE AND FEEDING PATTERNS OF SPOTTED HYAENAS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In some parts of east Africa, spotted hyenas (C. crocuta) live in large groups and at high population densities and scramble competition among clan members during feeding at large carcasses is reported. Spotted hyenas in the Namib Desert of southwestern Africa live in small groups and at low densities. When assembled at carcasses, Namib Desert spotted hyenas show linear dominance hierarchies. Adult females outrank adult males and usually feed one at a time or with their dependent offspring. Feeding rates at small carcasses in the Namib Desert are approximately equal to those reported in east Africa, but at large carcasses Namib Desert spotted hyenas feed significantly more slowly. Lower-ranking individuals eventually gain access to large carcasses but are excluded from smaller ones. These patterns of food consumption are related to possible evolutionary pathways to social hunting by spotted hyenas.

TI INFANTICIDE AND NON-FATAL ATTACKS ON CHICKS BY RING-BILLED GULLS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Infanticide was rare in an undisturbed colony of ring-billed gulls (L. delawarensis) during 1976-1978 on Mugg''s Island, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Nonfatal attacks on chicks were more frequent than infanticide, were committed mainly against older (> 10 days) offspring and increased during the period after hatching. Early-hatching chicks suffered more attacks than late-hatching young, and in 1 yr those on large territories were assaulted more often than offspring on small territories. Parental absence allowed attacks on chicks. Data on intraspecific kleptoparasitism, begging by chicks and provisioning by parents suggest that food-stressed broods were subjected to the highest levels of attack because these chicks were most likely to rob food and to be unguarded by parents. These broods were larger at fledging, so their parents apparently had higher individual fitness.

TI TRANSFER OF INFORMATION CONCERNING DISTANT FOODS - A LABORATORY
   INVESTIGATION OF THE INFORMATION-CENTER HYPOTHESIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When choosing between 2 novel diets, an observer rat (Rattus norvegicus) prefers that diet previously eaten by a demonstrator conspecific with whom the observer has interacted prior to making its choice between diets. Demonstrator influence on observer diet selection is maintained even if, during the period of demonstrator-observer interaction, the demonstrator is anesthetized and a wire-mesh barrier prevents the demonstrator from physically contacting the observer. Demonstrator influence on observer diet choice is blocked by either rendering the observer anosmic or placing a transparent Plexiglas barrier between demonstrator and observer during their period of interaction. Olfactory cues passing from demonstrator to observer provide observers with information concerning demonstrators'' diets and these olfactory cues are sufficient to bias diet selection by observers. Observer rats that have learned the locations at which each of 3 diets are intermittently available can use information provided by demonstrators to increase foraging efficiency. Implications of the results both for the information-center hypothesis of the function of mammalian aggregations and for previous studies of social transmission of diet preference in rats are discussed.

TI ROLE REVERSAL IN COURTSHIP IN THE STOMATOPOD PSEUDOSQUILLA-CILIATA
   (CRUSTACEA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The 1st known case of precopulatory role reversal in a crustacean is reported in the stomatopod P. ciliata. Females of this species initiate courtship through visual displays and a vigorous sexual chase. Males enter courtship with restraint and appear to exercise choice by copulating selectively with females larger than themselves. This singular reversal in courtship roles occurs in the absence of paternal care, female guarding, or other male investment strategies typically invoked to explain such behavior. Males face certain risks in breeding, including the threat of aggression from the female and the loss of a considerable part of their reproductive investment through sperm competition. By mating with larger, more fecund females, males reduce the potential loss from sperm competition, but increase the risk of injury from the female. This combination of factors should promote caution in males along with a preference for larger females.

TI THE SOCIAL-CONTEXT OF SONG MIMICRY - SONG-MATCHING DIALECTS IN INDIGO
   BUNTINGS (PASSERINA-CYANEA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male indigo buntings (P. cyanea) (1st year) that match the song of an adult neighbor gain an advantage in acquiring a female, in nesting and in fledging young, when compared with 1st year males that do not match a neighbor''s song (Payne 1982). Four hypotheses of the mechanisms responsible for the mimics'' success were tested in the field. Song matching among neighbors was not involved with recognition of local demes or with assortative mating; the population structure of song neighborhoods is open and songs are not signals of kinship or community. Song matching was not directed towards females in sexual mimicry and females rarely switched from an old mate to a younger one with the same song. Song mimicry was not directed towards the neighboring male whose song was copied, as he was not less aggressive towards a song mimic than towards non-mimics. Song mimicry was associated with the timing of territorial establishment and of associated dispersal and residence in the 1st year males. Four out of 6 predictions of a hypothesis of intraspecific competitive mimicry among male buntings were realized. The results best fit the hypothesis that a male that mimics the song of an older neighbor may deceive his territorial competitors, the other 1st year males, in mistaken individual recognition.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The responsiveness to alarm of lapwings (V. vanellus), golden plovers (P. apricaria) and black-headed gulls (L. ridibundus), feeding in mixed flocks was quantified using a human observer as an alarm stimulus. Responsiveness in lapwings and golden plovers correlated best with those flock composition variables (except gull number) which influenced individual scanning rate in earlier studies. Gulls appeared to provide lapwings and golden plovers with early warning of alarm: birds were less likely to respond but responded sooner when gulls were present and had longer flight distances in the presence of gulls. Gulls were also less likely to respond if other gulls were present. Responsiveness in all 3 spp. decreased with increasing field area, and lapwings and golden plovers were more responsive on warm days. The early-warming effect of gulls is seen as one benefit of mixed association accruing to plovers which may partly offset the costs of kleptoparasitism by gulls found in earlier studies.

TI TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR OF THE RED-BACKED SALAMANDER - EXPULSION OF
   INTRUDERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Red-backed salamanders, P. cinereus, were paired in laboratory chambers where they defended areas against each other by threat display and biting. Difference in sizes of paired individuals was not correlated with which one would enter the other''s area or be more aggressive after an intrusion. No sexual differences were found in agonistic behavior. Both defenders and intruders assumed a threat posture for about 50% of the invasion periods, but defenders exhibited a higher rate of biting. Defenders expelled intruders in 74% of all encounters, while intruders expelled defenders in 18%, with 8% of the encounters a draw. Intruders frequently left the contested area even in the absence of biting or threat display by the defender, apparently in response to the defender''s pheromones or to the high potential cost of an escalated aggressive contest (damage to the chemosensory structures).These data provide behavioral evidence that a salamander can evict intruders from a defended area and thus support the hypothesis of territoriality among terrestrial salamanders.

TI MATE RECOGNITION IN MEMBERS OF THE DROSOPHILA-NASUTA COMPLEX
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An examination of the courtship patterns of species belonging to the D. nasuta complex shows that markings which are characteristic of males are almost certainly involved in their recognition as conspecifics by females. In each species the males perform a courtship sequence in such a way as to expose these markings to the female. A phylogeny of the species based on both male courtship patterns and the associated male markings is constructed. This phylogeny is compared to previously published phylogenies of the same group which were based on fixed and floating chromosomal differences between the species. The evidence which the complex provides for the utility and general significance of a new species concept, the Recognition Concept, is evaluated.

TI MECHANISMS AND DEVELOPMENT OF PARENT-YOUNG VOCAL RECOGNITION IN THE
   PINON JAY (GYMNORHINUS-CYANOCEPHALUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mutual, vocal parent-young recognition is achieved by pinon jays (G. cyanocephalus) by the time the young leave the nest at 21 days to form stable creches of dependent young. Both parents and young begin producing individualistic calls, upon which recognition is based, when the young are 14 days old. Playbacks of nestlings'' begging calls to adults and parents'' approach calls to nestlings showed that mutual recognition of each other''s calls is learned between nestling age of 14 and 20 days. Sonographic and statistical analyses of the begging calls of nestling and fledgling jays showed the calls to be highly individualistic. Both univariate and multivariate (PCA [principal components analysis]) statistical methods were used to determine amounts of significant variation within and among the calls of different individuals and to isolate parameters which might be used by parents in offspring recognition. The analyses support 2 major conclusions. First, 20.4% of all variance measured in the calls is due to variation among individuals'' calls. The data imply that adults may recognize their offspring''s calls based on gestalt perception of simultaneous variation in a number of parameters. Second, each young bird''s calls vary gradually with time, requiring parents to track the calls of their offspring over time. These conclusions are only tentative until a correlation between statistically significant variation and biologically significant variation is demonstrated.

TI DISPERSAL OF YEARLING YELLOW-BELLIED MARMOTS (MARMOTA-FLAVIVENTRIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Field studies of the social organization of yellow-bellied marmots (M. flaviventris) near Gothic, Colorado [USA], were initiated in 1962. Data collected over 14 yr are used to analyze the behaviors that correlate with the time yearling male and yearling female marmots leave their natal home sites. Dispersal of yearling male yellow-bellied marmots was delayed when there were many yearling males in a harem, when yearling males were underweight, and when the rates of amicable interactions between yearling males and adults were high. Dispersal of yearling females was delayed when adults behaved amicably toward them and when the rates of adult aggression were low. Dispersal of yearling females was independent of the number of females in a harem. These observations are in accord with a model of dispersal that relates sexual differences in dispersal to maternal reproductive tactics, and to responses of yearlings that would maximize their own fitness.

TI ASYNCHRONOUS HATCHING IN THE LAUGHING GULL - CUTTING LOSSES AND REDUCING
   RIVALRY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The adaptive significance of hatching asynchrony was investigated in the laughing gull (L. atricilla). Staggered hatching of the brood is frequently correlated with reduced survival in the later-hatching chicks, and the phenomenon is the subject of speculation about adaptive function. The relative timing of hatching within the brood was experimentally manipulated in order to compare the effects of synchrony vs. asynchrony on parental reproductive success. The average number of young fledging per nest was significantly higher in the asynchronous group. Staggered hatching of the brood is hypothesized to be a parental strategy offering the option of brood reduction under conditions of food shortage. The possibility is discussed that asynchronous hatching benefits parents independently by reducing sibling rivalry over parental investment and minimizing wasteful competition.

DT Review
AB Mate choice by female redwinged blackbirds (A. phoeniceus) was investigated. Females preferentially selected males holding territories on which the number of young fledged from successful nests. Predation rates were high on the preferred territories. Females did not make the optimal choice in that expected reproductive success was not maximized. Probably as a result of competition among females, the largest harems were not found on the preferred territories.

TI SOLAR CUES IN THE MIGRATORY ORIENTATION OF THE SAVANNAH SPARROW,
   PASSERCULUS-SANDWICHENSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The setting sun as a critical source of directional information in the migratory orientation of the savannah sparrow, P. sandwichensis was examined. Savannah sparrows allowed a view of both sunset and stars displayed oriented behavior in biologically meaningful directions during spring and fall seasons. When the same individuals were denied a view of sunset, and tested under the stars alone, disorientation characterized their behavior. Birds allowed a view of sunset, but tested under overcast night skies (no stars visible), displayed well-oriented behavior, indicating the sufficiency of sunset. Experiments in which the migrant''s internal chronometer was shifted suggested a fixed-angle (menotactic) response to the sunset cue rather than a time-compensating compass mechanism. Stars may be valuable to this migrant as celestial reference points. Orientational information gained at the time of sunset is transferred to stars on a nightly basis. The relationship between solar and stellar cues is apparently hierarchical in the savannah sparrow. Information that is necessary to select the appropriate migratory direction is gained from the primary cue.sbd.the setting sun.sbd.while maintenance of that heading is dependent on a secondary cue, probably the stars.

TI INBREEDING AVOIDANCE IN CHIMPANZEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a community of chimpanzees in Gombe National Park [Tanzania], females'' associations with their previous closest male associates (usually maternal siblings) dropped abruptly when they commenced full estrous cycles, in some cases because the females changed their range within their natal community. Sexual activity was very infrequent between maternal siblings and between mothers and sons. Whereas males remained in their natal community all their lives, most or all females transferred to other communities during adolescence either permanently or temporarily. Inter-community transfer by females apparently resulted from attraction to unfamiliar males. Inbreeding may be avoided in this species as a consequence of reduced sexual attraction between individuals who were familiar with each other in immaturity.

AB The relative importance of input from chemoreceptors on the medial vs. the lateral antennular flagellae of the spiny lobster, P. argus, in olfactory orientation is examined. Ablation experiments show that input from the lateral filament, specifically the aesthetasc tuft of the lateral filament, is necessary and sufficient to trigger searching behavior in this organism when stimulated with a gradient of dilute shrimp extract. P. argus locates the odor source by using this lateral filament input in both tropotactic and klinotactic comparisons of odor intensities.

TI VERVET MONKEY ALARM CALLS - SEMANTIC COMMUNICATION IN A FREE-RANGING
   PRIMATE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Vervet monkeys (C. aethiops) at Amboseli, Kenya, give acoustically different alarm calls to different predators. Each alarm evokes contrasting, seemingly adaptive, responses. Animals on the ground respond to leopard alarms by running into trees, to eagle alarms by looking up and to snake alarms by looking down. In a 14 mo. field study examining the semantic properties of alarm calls, tape-recorded alarms were played to vervets in the absence of actual predators and the monkeys'' responses were filmed. Playbacks confirmed observations and showed that alarm length, amplitude and alarmist''s age/sex class had little effect on response quality, and context was not a systematic determinant of response. Vervet alarm calls function to designate different classes of external danger.

AB Little is known about the structure of mating aggregations of insects or sexual selection within them. Male lovebugs (P. nearctica) hover in large swarms above emergence sites in the ground litter. Females emerge periodically and take flight through the hovering males. Females may be grasped by one or more males before or during flight. Male-male interactions and the structure of lovebug swarms are clearly related to competition for access to emerging females. Lovebug swarms are distinctly stratified males at the top farthest from the ground. Large males closest to the ground have better access to females and experience copulatory success.

   NEIVAMYRMEX-NIGRESCENS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The successful rearing of the army ant N. nigrescens in the laboratory has indicated that the pheromone trail deposited by recruiting workers is qualitatively different from the ants'' exploratory trail. The recruitment trail alone can initiate as strong a mass recruitment response as can a recruiting worker that physically interacts with nestmates. The rapidity with which workers are aroused is due to secondary recruitment. Army ants are able to assemble a critical striking force before food is located, as a result of mass recruitment to new terrain. In addition to feeding behavior, mass recruitment occurs when army ants emigrate to new nests. In both behavior contexts, primary and secondary recruiters run more rapidly, with exagerrated vertical motor patterns, than exploring ants.

   HAEMATOPUS-OSTRALEGUS L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Oystercatchers were distributed non-randomly on mussel-beds in winter; the loose foraging flocks showed a spaced-out gregariousness. Aggressive defense of personal space within the flock was evidently not responsible for this spacing, as most attacks were not directed against birds unusually close to aggressors. Mutual avoidance, rather than overt aggression, apparently maintained the observed non-random spacing. Oystercatchers seemed to attack others to steal newly-opened mussels, but the likelihood of successfully gaining an illicit mussel in this way declined as the initial distance between attacker and victim increased. In this situation, the risk of falling victim to food theft may make avoidance of conspecifics advantageous.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB The crepuscular rhythm of Melanoides may be controlled by 2 oscillators and there may be no fixed relationship between the 2. The time of light on and off activity peaks is determined primarily by the time of the appropriate light stimuli, and in constant relative darkness the activity peaks retain the approximate phase relationship of the entraining regimen. A similar relationship is seen in constant light only for animals entrained to photoperiods with a scotophase of 12 h or more. With shorter periods of darkness, the light on peak occurs about 12 h after the light off. A model for the control mechanism is postulated and discussed.

TI SCENT-MARKING IN LONE WOLVES AND NEWLY FORMED PAIRS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Scent-marking was studied in wolves (C. lupus) along 133 km of tracks in northern Minnesota [USA] during winters of 1975-1976 and 1976-1977 and in 2 captive packs and 4 captive pairs for various periods. Lone wolves, which possess neither mates nor territories, rarely marked by raised-leg urination and defecated and urinated less along roads and trails, where territorial pairs and packs generally marked. Newly formed pairs marked the most, eventually decreasing their rates to those of established packs. Wolves that scent-marked also bred, while non-marking wolves usually did not breed. Scent-marking apparently is important to the success of courtship in new pairs, to reproductive synchrony in established pairs, and in serving a territorial function.

All infants responded with interference to a proportion of their mothers'' copulations which coincided with weaning. Male juveniles also interfered in copulations of unrelated females. Adult males sometimes responded aggressively to others'' copulatory attempts when being possessive of a female, but their response was regulated by the relative ranks of the males involved. The motivation and function of the various responses to copulation are discussed.

TI COMPARISON OF INTERMALE FIGHTING IN STANDARD OPPONENT TESTS AND ATTACK
   DIRECTED TOWARDS LOCUSTS BY TO STRAIN MICE - EFFECTS OF SIMPLE
   EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A preliminary description is provided of locust killing behavior in albino TO strain mice. As this behavior can be classified as predatory aggression, the influences of a series of simple experimental manipulations were studied on locust killing and fighting in a standard opponent test in order to determine whether these 2 behaviors have affinities (as implied by the use of the term aggression to describe them) or whether they are rather different. Factors investigated included sex, prior experience, isolation and grouping, dominance and subordination, a high or a low incidence of the other behavior, food deprivation, gonadectomy and induction of peripheral anosmia. In this vast majority of cases, the 2 forms of aggression were not influenced in the same direction by an experimental manipulation. This form of predatory aggression and intermale fighting seem very different. Extreme caution should be employed in extrapolations between these forms of aggression.

TI BROOD REDUCTION IN BIRDS - SELECTION FOR FRATRICIDE, INFANTICIDE AND
   SUICIDE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Kin selection and inclusive fitness concepts are used to formulate a general theory accounting for the phenomenon of brood reduction in birds. The theory shows that as starvation mortality increases, selection favors at first fraticide, then fratricide plus infanticide, and finally fratricide, infanticide and suicide (by the nestling with the shortest life expectancy). A theoretical treatment of the alternative option, food sharing accompanied by concomitant reduction in growth rate, shows the latter to be ineffective when nest predation is high. Brood reduction is not limited in this manner. The theory allows several testable predictions about the incidence of starvation, starvation mortality and sibling aggression, and their brood-size dependence and timing. These predictions are largely supported by the available evidence.

TI COMMUNICATION-SYSTEMS AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN A GOBY-SHRIMP SYMBIOSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Interphyletic communication is quantitatively shown to occur in a behavioral, mutualistic symbiotic association between the goby Psilogobius mainlandi and 2 spp. of shrimps, Alpheus rapax and A. rapacida, by the use of information theory and .chi.2 analyses. Communication between gobies and shrimps is primarily tactual. Gobies use as shelter, burrows dug and maintained by shrimps. Gobies sit at the burrow entrance and warn shrimps of danger by a flick of the tail. Shrimps communicate their presence outside the burrow by touching gobies with their antennae. Gobies never give warning signals in the absence of shrimps. The spacing of the burrows in nature is probably a result of the complex interaction of 3 communication systems: tactual communication among shrimps and between gobies and shrimps and visual communication among gobies. The analysis techniques used may be applied to the analysis of other symbiotic associations.

TI FAMILY STATUS AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO BREEDING BY FLORIDA SCRUB JAYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Nestling care by Florida scrub jay Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens breeders and helpers in quantified. Breeding males and older male helpers deliver more food than 1st-yr helpers and older female helpers. Breeding males adjust the quantity of food they deliver inversely to that delivered by their helpers. Older female helpers, who make many nest visits without delivering food, attempt to usurp the nest-sitting role of the breeding female. The advantages of group breeding to the brgeders seem clear. Pairs with helpers live longer the produce more fledglings. The advantages of being a helper, probably include non-altruistic factors such as increased survival and, for males, increased chances of obtaining space for breeding. Food contributions of helpers seem to parallel these opportunities. [This study was conducted in Florida, USA.].

TI INTERACTION OF LIGHT AND GRAVITY IN ORIENTATION OF WAGGLE DANCE OF HONEY
   BEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The waggle angle of honey bees (Apis mellifera) performing the waggle dance under the simultaneous influence of light and gravity was investigated. Measurements are reported for the full range of angles between the gravity vector and the orienting light source, and for a wide range of foraging flight angles with respect to the sun. The compromise dance angles observed when the orienting stimuli due to light and gravity conflict indicate that for intermediate intensity settings the bees favor light orientation for small light-gravity angles but favor gravity orientation when this angle is large. The re-orienting effect of light on the gravity dance modes, or of gravity on light dance modes, is not a simple trigonometric function of either angular variable, but is strongly skewed; it appears not to depend upon the foraging flight angle with respect to the sun. Neither the ''Kompensationstheorie'' (Jander 1957) nor the ''Bikomponententheorie'' (Mittelstaedt 1961) of animal orientation, as presently formulated, permits description of all significant features of the data.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sexual behavior of male smooth newts, T. vulgaris, was observed in a standard test situation under reduced, normal and increased O2 availability. The variations in O2 supply not only produced marked differences in the frequency of breathing ascents but also affected the temporal patterning of sexual behavior. In particular, males slightly speeded up their sexual behavior under reduced O2 reduced, thus partly compensating for the fact that less time could be devoted to sexual behavior under such conditions. The motivational system controlling the male''s behavior may incorporate causal factors related not only to sex but also to O2 supply. There is also evidence that breathing, following sexual behavior, occurs by disinhibition when O2 is scarce, but by competition when it is abundant.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Six wandering shrews (S. vagrans) were trained to echolocate the position of a platform and drop to it. They preferentially directed their ultrasonic emissions at the platform. With their ears plugged, they were unable to locate it above chance levels even though they increased their emission rate. Shrews with hollow tubes in their ears performed as effectively as controls. Echolocating shrews, trained on an elevated Y-maze, detected a 15 .times. 15 cm flat metal barrier to a distance of 65 cm. The minimum detectable barrier at 20 cm was 3.5 .times. 3.5 cm. They detected a target with a 4 .times. 4 cm hole to 30 cm. Their dependence on echolocation was inversely related to familiarity with an area. Audition was important for the location of suitable cover in strange areas. The adaptive significance of echolocation to the wandering shrew is discussed.

TI BEHAVIOR OF DOMESTIC CHICKS DURING EXPOSURE TO 2 STIMULI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Chicks were observed during exposure to red and to blue cylinders. Although chicks apparently become imprinted with both stimuli regardless of their temporal characteristics there were differences in their responses to the 2 stimuli which depended on the way they were presented. When the 2 objects appeared in rapid alternation the chicks behaved similarly in the presence of both stimuli and any differences tended to disappear as exposure progressed. When the 2 stimuli appeared in separate 1/2 h blocks there were changes of behavior at the changeover from 1 object to the other. The behavior of chicks during the different sorts of stimulus presentation can be related to their performance on a subsequent discrimination involving the same 2 stimuli.

TI DOMINANCE BOUNDARY METHOD OF DETERMINING MOTIVATIONAL STATE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A model is outlined in which physiological state affects behavior through command variables. Theoretically command space can be divided into regions in which different behaviors are dominant. These regions are bounded by switching lines which should be experimentally observable. It is shown that, in the case of the Barbary dove [Streptopelia risoria], it is possible by use of a suitable reward schedule (the double interruption schedule) to hold all causal factors for feeding and drinking other than physiological deficit constant (or to mask their variation). When this is done either feeding or drinking occurs according to whether the deficit for food or water is greater. This is equivalent to saying that there exists a straight switching line (estimated by the dominance boundary) in a deficit space with axes food deficit and water deficit, both measured in grams. The position of this line in deficit space does not vary systematically over a period of time, and is not affected either by initial deprivation or by radical alterations in the consequences of feeding and drinking. It is possible to estimate the motivational state of the animal from a knowledge of its position in deficit space and the position of the dominance boundary. Analogous experiments with pigs give less clear-cut results.

TI PRIOR EXPERIENCE AND APPROACH RESPONSE IN DOMESTIC CHICKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Trials were conducted to determine the effects of stimulation via different sensory modalities on the tendency of naive chicks to respond toward and to approach a distant audio-visual imprinting apparatus 24 [plus or minus]1 hr. post-hatching. Effects of age and prior socialization were also studied. It was found that tactile-plus-visual stimulation prior to testing temporarily satiated a chick''s tendency to respond to the imprinting apparatus while tactile stimulation alone had no effect on such tendencies. Visual stimulation alone increased the number of responses and approaches. Isolated chicks responded better than socials, but handling chicks prior to testing could mask this difference. Tactile-plus-visual stimulation at 5 and 9 hr. post-hatching had no effect but such experience at 13, 17, and 23 hr. decreased the approach response.

TI RELATION BETWEEN OLFACTORY STIMULATION AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR IN MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The aggres-sion of male Swiss albino mice was studied under 3 conditions: when the animals were artificially scented; when they were made anosmic by bulbectomy, and when in normal (unscented and intact) state. The subjects were all experienced fighters, selected on the basis of a high level of aggression. A substantial reduction of aggression occurred when the animals'' natural odors were masked by scent. In anosmic male mice, aggression was totally absent. It would seem probable that olfactory stimuli are involved in the release of aggressive behavior in male mice; and further, that the olfactory system includes a mechanism, apparently involving the bulbs, necessary to the elicitation of aggressive behavior at normal levels of intensity.

TI METHODS OF REARING AND SOCIAL INTERACTION IN MACACA NEMESTRINA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The social interactions of 2 equally sexed groups, each of 4 pig-tailed macaques (ages 7 to 9 mo.), were recorded under standard conditions for 50 daily trials and compared for effects of their early experience. One group, mother-reared and allowed to live in a relatively unrestricted social and physical environment, served as controls. The other group comprised infants removed from their mothers at birth and reared under restricted social and physical conditions. Play and communicative behaviors were significantly less frequent in the group of socially-restricted infants compared with experienced infants. Only in the group without social experience did fear-grimacing, aggression, digit-sucking and self-clasping appear, effects paralleling those also attributed to maternal absence and insufficient contact with peers in infant rhesus macaques. Brief daily play-periods did not facilitate the social development of restricted infants to control levels when tested at less than 1 yr of age. Sexual dimorphism in patterns of social interaction were evident only in the socially reared group. Early social deprivation interferes with the development of social responsiveness in the pig-tailed macaque as in the rhesus.

TI NURSING AND SUCKLING BEHAVIOUR AMONGST CLUN FOREST EWES AND LAMBS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A sunrise to sunset watch, repeated at weekly intervals for 8 wk., was carried out on 19 ewes and their 12 single and 7 pairs of twin lambs. It appeared that, up to the end of the 4th wk of life, twins suckled more frequently than singles and that the average duration of the individual sucklings was about the same for single and twin lambs of the same age. A facilitative component could be detected in some of the nursing/suckling behavior. There appeared to be a correlation in the 1st 3 wk of life (but not in the 2nd 3 weeks) between the frequency of suckling and the weight gain of lambs. From about the 5th week onward, about 1 /2 the single and twin pairs of lambs appeared to have a definite side from which they would suckle their dams'' udders. It seemed that some of the twin lambs had learnt that a ewe was unlikely to suckle 1 of a twin pair unless the other was present.

TI TURN ALTERNATION IN WOODLICE (PORCELLIO SCABER)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB It was shown that response alternation frequency in woodlice became higher with the number of prior forced turns in 1 direction, but was unaffected by varied distance between the start and a forced turn. However, the frequency became lower with increased distance between a forced turn and a choice point, and also with detention following a forced turn. Woodlice kept in a bright, warm environment prior to testing made greater numbers of successive alternation responses in a multiple T maze and showed faster running speeds. It was concluded from this that adverse stimulation increases alternation merely by causing more rapid movement between turns. One possible adaptive function of response alternation in wood-lice may be to insure efficient, direct movement away from a noxious area.

TI INSTRUMENTAL CONDITIONING OF FRUIT FLY DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A demonstration of instrumental learning in Drosophila, long used in genetic studies, would permit genetically oriented investigations of learning phenomena under conditions not previously possible. Subjects were genetically selected for negative geotaxis (the tendency to move away from the pull of gravity). They were tested in a T-maze, where the reinforcer was their being allowed to ascend a vertical tube. Experiment I demonstrated acquisition and extinction, and that subjects could be trained to turn left or right. Experiment II showed differential affects on acquisition as a function of whether an animal had been shocked for making the incorrect response, whether he was required to correct an error, whether a subject received neither correction nor shock. Experiment III demonstrated acquisition under each of 4 different conditions of magnitude and delay of reinforcement, although performance was not differentially affected by the 4 conditions. Reliability of response scoring method was estimated to be .925. On the basis of some 8 independent demonstrations of reinforcement correlated behavioral change over several experimental conditions, it is concluded that the fruit fly is able to acquire an instrumental habit.

TI PRESSURE SENSITIVITY REFLEXES AND BUOYANCY RESPONSES IN TELEOSTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Twelve spp. of marine and 1 fresh-water teleost were studied to determine the reflex and behavioral characteristics of pressure sensitivity and buoyancy, adjustment. A pressure gradient chamber was devised, a tube which utilized the sine relationship between angular distance and depth to analyse buoyancy activity. Pinfish and black sea bass were cinephotographically recorded and analyzed in detail. All fishes had a yawn reflex subject ambient pressure changes. It was induced by changes of 2.0 cm H2O or less. Pinfish and sea bass were adapted tothe gradient chamber and experimentally analyzed for periods from 14 to 46 days. These fishes, within 1-3 days, always established a base reference point, or fix position, around which all buoyancy related activity centered. During critical adjustment it was held for 1-3 min, by a poised fish, with error in 3 dimensions less than about 2.0 mm. On leaving, the fish regained the fix position with the same precision. These fishes were sensitive to less than 0.5 cm H2O pressure. They had reaction time within 0.1 sec to pressure changes. Passive buoyancy displacement induced visual, tactile, and fin orientation reactions which were stereotyped, buoyancy correlated, and proportional to pressure parameters. These reactions included locomotor patterns which were correlated with test-adjust activities in buoyancy compensation. Negative buoyancy was normal at rest, and positive buoyancy was aversive. Physoclistous teleosts are shown to have major behavioral patterns for buoyancy compensation. They can adjust buoyancy by swimbladder regulation with a sensitivity and precision comparable to postural regulation in terrestrial mammals. The behavioral involvement is sufficiently complex and sensitive to account for many practical observations about barometric, tidal, and reproductive behavior in the natural environment.

DT Article
AB Male and female rats from 2 inbred strains selectively bred for high and low emotional elimination and from the Fl derived from crossing these strains were given a single injection of 500 [mu]g testosterone propionate or 100 [mu]g estradiol benzoate in arachis oil at 5 days of age. Control subjects received placebo injections of arachis oil or no treatment. At 100 days of age, all subjects were tested in an open arena and in an observation cage and measures were obtained of their responses (defecation, ambulation, rearing and grooming) to novel stimulation (loud noise and bright light). The results suggest that neonatal estrogen decreased adult tearfulness; the androgen effects were less marked, but tended in the same direction. In addition, the placebo led to an increase in fearful-ness in the inbred strains but not in the Fl. Sex and strain differences on the measures used are also discussed and estimates of some of the genetic components of variation are derived by biometrical analysis.

TI QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF LOCOMOTION IN TEIID LIZARDS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Several species of the family Teiidae and one iguanid, Callisaurus, are compared and quantitatively analyzed through motion picture studies. In the animals studied, no major differences exist in vertical movements of head for quadrupedal walk gaits; a correlation exists between amount of up-and-down movement and quadrupedal fast and bipedal gaits: the faster the animal, the greater the amount of vertical head movement. As a teiid increases its speed, total vertical distance of head displacement increases. The faster a teiid runs, the more erectly it holds its head. Angles of the trunk and head from the horizontal are less in teiids than in iguanids and agamids. The faster the teiid, the greater the angle; regardless of the gait, fast teiids hold their trunks more erect than do slow-moving forms; the latter in effect drag their abdomens. The acetabulum and abdomen in any gait are held higher from the ground in teiids that demonstrate both quadrupedal walk and quadrupedal fast gaits than in those showing only quadrupedal walk gait. In fast teiids, the plane of motion of the femur has changed slightly from a horizontal toward a vertical position. Whenever teiids employ quadrupedal walk gaits, the fore foot leaves and touches the ground ahead of the contralateral hind foot; in quadrupedal fast gaits, the hind foot leaves and touches the ground ahead of the contralateral fore foot. Fast teiids must run through at least one cycle of quadrupedal fast gait before becoming bipedal; quadrupedalism rather than dipedalism is predominantly utilized by fast teiids. In quadrupedal walk gaits, hind feet of Tupinambis are put in front of ipselateral fore feet, while [in all other teiids studied they are placed behind the fore feet. In quadrupedal fast gaits, only Ameiva, Cnemido-phorus tigris, and Tupinambis place hind in front of fore feet. In fast-running teiids, the distance of stride lengthens as speed increases; rates of stride increase more with change of gait in teiids than in other fast-moving lizards thus far studied. Summation of all relative values of stride and associated characters for quadrupedal gaits results in the following progression; Pholidopolus-Teius-Crocodilurus-Ameiva-Tupinambis-Cnemidophorus-Callisaurus Pholidopolus is the poorest locomotive performer; Callisaurus is the best. This progression in motion picture data are suggestive of possible steps in the evolution of rapid terrestrial locomotion of lizards. Similarity in locomotive patterns of Teius, Ameiva, Cnemidophorus, and Tupinambis occur even though they seem superficially to run differently; this similarity reflects the close taxonomic relationships of these animals.

TI MANTLE RESPONSE OF DIODORA ASPERA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Diadora aspera, the common keyhole limpet of the N. American, Pacific coast, displays a characteristic escape response to 9 species of seastars, 1 ophiuroid, and 1 echinoid. Six of the seastars occur in the same area as the limpet; 1, Pisaster ochraceus, may be a significant predator. The reaction differs from most previously described in not including any movement away from the stimulating animal. The response consists of protrusion of the siphon from the keyhole, and extension and flexing of the middle mantle fold to cover most of the shell. The effect is the discouraging and repelling of the tube feet of the predator, and proved effective protection for 10 limpets in an aquarium with 2 seastars for 6 days. Response followed contact, proximity without contact, and exposure to seawater in which a stimulating seastar had been previously kept. Repeated stimulation of the same limpet resulted in some indication of sensitization. The behavior of the limpets in the aquarium suggested some degree of adaptation. It is assumed that the stimulating seastar produces an external metabolite which is soluble in seawater, heat labile, and unable to act through a dialyzing membrane.

AB It gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to Mary Jane West-Eberhard, who inspired me not only to conduct my research on the Indian paper wasp Ropalidia marginata as a curiosity-driven intellectual pursuit but also to practise and uphold high ethical standards as a member of the scientific community. I also provide a very brief summary of our present understanding of the social biology of R. marginata, obtained 'using detailed observations of behaviour both for generating questions and for answering them', in the spirit of the Eberhards. We have discovered that the queens of R. marginata begin their careers as hyperaggressive individuals but quickly become meek and docile and use nonvolatile pheromones to maintain their reproductive monopoly. One of the workers we call the 'potential queen' quickly replaces a lost or experimentally removed queen. It has been very challenging for us to predict the identity of the potential queen in the presence of the queen, although we have clear evidence that the workers are somehow aware of her. We now believe that we have a fair understanding of why some wasps become queens and other become workers, because we are able to make workers into queens experimentally.

TI The effect of temporal masking on alarm call communication in wild

   predation risk; temporal masking
ID NOISE; BIRDS; BACKWARD; DISCRIMINATION; INFORMATION; PREFERENCE;
   RESPONSES
AB Noise from human activity is a global concern that threatens wildlife, including by disrupting acoustic communication. This disruption appears predominantly caused by masking, where noise makes it difficult to hear acoustic signals. Previous studies have found a strong masking effect when noise and signals occur simultaneously. However, noise can also have a temporal masking effect, meaning that the signal is not detected even if noise occurs before or after the signal (forward and backward masking, respectively). As background noise is often intermittent, temporal masking by natural sounds and anthropogenic noise could pose a significant challenge for animal communication. Surprisingly, although commonly found in humans, temporal masking has been rarely studied in other species. To investigate whether temporal masking affects bird communication in the wild, we conducted a playback experiment on superb fairy-wrens, Malurus cyaneus, using single-element alarm calls before, during and after filtered white noise, as well as a control playback of alarm calls alone. We found that fairy-wrens stopped responding to alarm calls during noise, showing simultaneous masking, but were equally likely to flee if there was noise immediately before or after an alarm call as when there was no noise, suggesting a lack of temporal masking. However, among those fairy-wrens that fled, there was a 20 ms delay in the response to alarm calls after the noise, possibly because of subtle forward masking that delayed call reception. We conclude that temporal masking is unlikely to stop fairy-wrens' fleeing to alarm calls but might slightly delay call reception. We urge further studies of temporal masking in other species, using various sources of natural and anthropogenic noise, as only then will we know whether temporal masking is of general significance in compromising animal communication.

AB Social foraging is commonly used across taxa to increase animal foraging success in uncertain environments and is believed to be a driver of social group formation. In temperate zones, females of many bat species form seasonal colonies, whereas males are usually solitary. Males of only a few bat species form temporary colonies during sperm production, likely to benefit from social foraging, social thermoregulation, or both. We radiotracked a group of reproductive male particoloured bats, Vespertilio murinus, to test the hypothesis that they use social foraging. Foraging bats overlapped in time and space significantly more than expected by chance, suggesting that they used social information to increase detection of insect swarms. Dyads also sometimes switched foraging patches together, suggesting parttime use of the more coordinated group facilitation social foraging strategy. Our results support the hypothesis that male particoloured bats use local enhancement mixed with group facilitation during sperm production and that improved foraging success through information transfer is a likely driver of seasonal sociality in these and other male bats.

AB Heatwaves are becoming more common due to climate change. Species can respond to this thermal stress through rapid behavioural changes. For example, parental care can increase reproductive success by buffering against thermal stress, but the ability to provide parental care may also be influenced by prior exposure to high temperatures. However, the effects of heatwaves in parents' early development on parental care they provide in adulthood have not yet been tested. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap using the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, an ectotherm model system with facultative biparental care. We compared the parental behaviour, reproductive success and offspring fitness of parents that had been exposed to a heatwave (3 days at 25 degrees C) early in the pupae stage in their development and parents that had been reared at a constant temperature. Females from the heatwave treatment were more likely to provide care than those in the control treatment, with no difference in reproductive success or offspring fitness between thermal treatments. Our findings suggest that heatwaves during the pupae development stage can potentially have long-term impacts on the likelihood of providing parental care later in life.

AB Organisms that nest in ant-defended trees presumably benefit from ants deterring potential enemies. How birds build a nest while surrounded by ant workers and how the ants are kept away from the fledglings are unknown. In Costa Rican dry forests, two bird species (streak-backed oriole, Icterus pustulatus, and yellow-olive flycatcher, Tolmomyias sulphurescens) preferentially nest in Pseudomyrmex ant-defended swollen-thorn acacias (Vachellia) and build the entire nest with fungal rhizomorphs. We tested whether rhizomorphs alter acacia ants' behaviour as a potential mechanism to deter aggressive ants from the birds' nests. We also tested whether water increased the properties of the fungus, because birds nest during the rainy season. Hence, we recorded detailed observations of ant behaviour after contacting plant fibres (control) and dry and wet rhizomorphs. After touching the rhizomorphs, the probability of grooming and speeding up was higher (>65%) than after contacting plant fibres (<30%). Some ant behaviours were never observed with the plant fibres but had a higher probability of occurring (similar to 16-67%) after the ants touched rhizomorphs: gaster curling, biting a nestmate, spinning and wandering erratically. Water did not enhance putative rhizomorph properties. The results indicate signs of alarm, repellence and intoxication after interacting with rhizomorphs. Therefore, birds may benefit from using fungal rhizomorphs as it may deter the ants from entering the nest. This finding opens a venue for research questions, including whether the fungus effects are specific to acacia ants or can be generalized to other social hymenopterans that the birds choose to live nearby (e.g. wasps) or need to keep away from the nest (e.g. army ants).

AB Parental effects, or parental phenotypes affecting offspring phenotypes, are widespread across taxa, yet there is significant variation within species regarding which offspring traits are affected. One reason for this observed variation could be the type of sensory cues present in the parental environment. By exposing parents to sensory cues containing different information about the same ecological stressor, we can determine whether information is integrated differently by parents based on cue type, leading to differential trait development in offspring. In this study, we utilized predator cues, which can be found in isolation and in combination in natural settings, to test whether cue type plays a role in differential phenotype expression in Trinidadian guppies, Poecilia reticulata. Parents were exposed to predator cues (visual, olfactory or both combined) over 14 days, after which we assessed life history traits, morphology and activity. Offspring were then raised with no predator cues and tested for morphology and activity in adulthood. No differences in life history traits were observed across 10 weeks. In line with previous findings, behaviour differed in both the parent and F1 generations in response to predator cues; however, effects were dependent on cue type and sex. Our results suggest that exposure to even a single sensory cue is strong enough to initiate a cascade of responses both in parent and F1 generations, and that interacting factors such as cue type and sex lend importance to understanding consequences of parent risk perception for offspring.

AB Traditional conceptual models of movement assume that animals have 'perfect knowledge' of their environments. Although strong selective pressure may optimize animals' abilities to select favourable habitat components, few, if any, are born with an innate understanding of their environments. That is, individuals need to learn about the distributions and qualities of resources available to them, and this is particularly true for long-lived animals that must cope with dynamic environments over the courses of their lives. Members of many species passively acquire information about their environments while performing other essential activities, such as acquiring food, maintaining territories or searching for mates. But growing evidence suggests that animals may move deliberately for the express purpose of acquiring information. One such behaviour that may benefit animals particularly is to scout for winter resources (i.e. a limiting period) during summer (i.e. a time of abundance) when movements are less costly. Here, we investigate a population of North American porcupines, Erethizon dorsatum, to test whether they display this behaviour. We compared summer and winter habitat use by porcupines using GPS data and radiotelemetry. We also monitored seasonal selection of winter habitat with the use of trail cameras. We examined selection of nutritional and structural characteristics to identify potential drivers of scouting behaviour. We found that porcupines randomly sampled winter habitat during summer and returned in winter to locations with greater structural complexity but not higher nutritional quality. This study provides evidence of animals deliberately moving during summer to gain information about winter resources. More broadly, we suggest that scouting may be a search behaviour that individuals use to inform selection of resources in limiting seasons.

AB Social interactions (e.g. aggression, mating and parenting) often depend on the social environment, and recent studies suggest that the adult sex ratio (ASR, the proportion of males in the adult population) modulates these social interactions. While observational studies and phylogenetic analyses provide strong support for the proposition that the relative frequencies of adult males and females impact social decisions, the experimental evidence for the impacts of ASR on social interactions is moot. In this study, we manipulated ASR in dung beetles, Onthophagus taurus , to test the responses of males and females in contest behaviour, courtship behaviour and breeding success. We found that ASR in fluenced the intensity of both contest and courtship, with both contests and courtships being more frequent in male-biased ASRs than in female-biased and unbiased treatments. The weight of brood balls did not differ signi fi- cantly between ASR treatments, suggesting that ASR does not affect the breeding success of dung beetles by changing the parental investment of females and males. Moreover, the mean number of brood balls per male was fewer in male-biased treatments than in female-biased and unbiased treatments, while there was no signi ficant difference in the mean number of brood balls per female between treatments, supporting the hypothesis that a male-skewed ASR can impair the breeding success of organisms by in fluencing the reproductive capacity of males but not females. Our results extend the understanding of the in fluence of ASR on the reproductive strategy decisions of males and females in breeding success. Future analyses are needed to understand the physiological and genetic implications of mate choice and contest behaviour in the context of a variable social environment, as represented by ASR.

AB Socially transmitted behavioural patterns (i.e. cultural traditions) have been observed in many whale species from large baleen whales to small dolphins. However, no cultural traditions have been described so far in beaked whales, an elusive and poorly studied group of toothed whales. In this study we report a local population of Baird's beaked whales, Berardius bairdii, in the Commander Islands regularly using a shallow area with depths of less than 300 m which is uncharacteristic for this species. We analysed the distribution of this behaviour and mtDNA haplotypes among individual whales to explore whether it represents a cultural tradition and whether it is transmitted vertically within separate maternal lineages or horizontally among nonrelated whales. We found that the whales that frequently visited the study area, and therefore were familiar with the underwater landscape, often used the shallow areas of the shelf slope, while transient whales, unfamiliar with the local conditions, mostly adhered to the depth range typical of their species. Only those transient whales that maintained social bonds with residents were sometimes observed in shallow areas. Order-of-acquisition diffusion analysis showed that social transmission of knowledge about the shallow habitat was significantly more likely than individual asocial learning. Two mtDNA haplotypes were shared between whales that used the shallow areas and those that did not, suggesting that these categories did not represent separate maternal lineages. We conclude that knowledge of the shallow areas is transmitted horizontally through social learning, and therefore this is an example of a local cultural tradition. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Understanding the causes and consequences of foraging behaviour has been a longstanding research interest in the study of animal behaviour. Long-lived seabirds adapt their foraging behaviour in response to seasonal changes in marine environments, particularly to food availability, and the trade-off between current and future reproduction. This postulates the links and direction of causality between environments, foraging behaviour and chick growth; however, these relationships remain unclear, especially on a decadal scale. Here, we focused on streaked shearwaters, Calonectris leucomelas, breeding in the Sea of Japan, as they are an ideal species for examining seabird behavioural and reproductive responses to marine environmental changes. Individuals of this species have two alternative choices for foraging trips, selecting either the northern part of the Sea of Japan or the northwest Pacific Ocean, which have different oceanographic features. From 2011 to 2021, we recorded foraging trips of chick -rearing streaked shearwaters tagged with GPS loggers, and weighed chicks to obtain yearly chick growth rates. Path analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between the sea surface temperature, foraging behaviour of chick -rearing adults and chick growth rate. The results revealed that a larger variability in the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean and higher demand from chicks attracted the adults towards the Pacific Ocean, suggesting that the foraging area and marine predator distribution are determined by the interplay of food availability and offspring condition. These findings illustrate the importance of using long-term foraging behaviour data sets to better understand the relationships between environmental conditions, foraging behaviour and chick growth.

AB An integral characteristic of all predators is their size, which affects, among other things, their food preferences, and the ability of their prey to fight them off. Several studies have already found, unsurprisingly, that birds discriminate between and respond differently to predators of different sizes. The redbacked shrike, Lanius collurio, aggressively attacks the Eurasian jay, Garrulus glandarius, a common nest predator, whereas it remains passive towards the carrion crow, Corvus corone, which also commonly plunders passerine nests. A possible explanation may reside in the larger body size of crows. In our experiments, we exposed red-backed shrikes to downsized crow dummies and enlarged jay dummies. The shrikes responded to the largest jays with less aggression, suggesting that aggression towards the largest jays would increase risk of injury to parent shrikes and/or not increase the likelihood of offspring survival. In contrast, aggression increased only slightly towards the crows with reduced size. Thus, there was no general effect of body size on the attack rate of shrikes to the presented dummies. In the case of the crow, an alternative antipredator strategy, guarding and not attacking the predator, might affect the behaviour of some shrike parents. These results suggest that body size is one of the key parameters in the recognition of predators by red-backed shrikes, but it is evaluated differently in nest defence against two distinct predator species.

AB Social groups exist because some individuals within the group accrue a net benefit from sharing space. The profitability of sociality, however, varies with ecological context. As ecological context varies, tension emerges among the costs and benefits of social grouping. Fission-fusion societies are fluid in their group dynamics across spatial and temporal contexts, permitting insights into how context affects whether animals choose to join or depart from a group. We tested four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses driving variation in fission and fusion in caribou, Rangifer tarandus: (1) risky places, (2) environment heterogeneity, (3) activity budget and (4) social familiarity. The risky places hypothesis predicts that animals are unlikely to diffuse when habitats are open and the risk of predation is elevated. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis predicts that fission is more likely in a heterogeneous landscape due to the rising conflicts of interest between group members. The activity budget hypothesis predicts that dyads associate by body size due to similar food passage rates. The social cohesion hypothesis predicts that familiar individuals are less likely to fission. We tested the hypotheses using time-to-event (time before fission) analyses and a linear model that assesses spatial, social and body size relationships among female caribou (N 1/4 22) on Fogo Island, Newfoundland, Canada. Contrary to our prediction for risky places, probability of fission was not influenced by habitat openness. The hypothesis of environmental heterogeneity was partially supported, as caribou remained less cohesive in environments with a higher richness of habitats. No direct evidence emerged to support the activity budget hypothesis. However, it appears that caribou maintain the strongest social bonds among variably sized individuals and that these social bonds do decrease the propensity to split. Collectively, our findings showed that social interactions may depend not only on individual identity and characteristics, but also on the spatial context in which these interactions occur.

AB Many hosts of brood-parasitic cuckoos reject foreign eggs from the nest. Yet where nests commonly receive more than one cuckoo egg, hosts might benefit by instead accepting parasite eggs. This is because cuckoos remove an egg from the nest before adding their own, and keeping cuckoo eggs in the nest reduces the odds that further host eggs are removed by subsequent cuckoos. This 'clutch dilution effect' has been proposed as a precondition for the evolution of cuckoo nestling eviction by hosts, but no previous studies have tested this in a host that rejects cuckoo nestlings. We tested the clutch dilution hypothesis in large-billed gerygones, Gerygone magnirostris, which are multiply parasitized by little bronze-cuckoos, Chalcites minutillus. Gerygones evict cuckoo nestlings but accept cuckoo eggs. Consistent with multiple parasitism favouring egg acceptance, we found gerygone egg survival was higher under scenarios of cuckoo egg acceptance than rejection. Yet gerygones were also flexible in their egg acceptance, with 61% abandoning clutches if they contained only cuckoo eggs. Our results thus confirm a clutch dilution effect in gerygones and suggest that multiple parasitism might favour a facultative response to cuckoo eggs, whereby hosts accept or reject cuckoo eggs depending on clutch composition. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Studies of vocal kin recognition in avian species have typically tested responses to vocal signals based upon either familiarity (recognition via 'learned associations') or relatedness (recognition of genetic kin) but have rarely simultaneously tested for the effects of both. Here we examined vocal kin recognition in the cooperatively breeding southern pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, using vocalizations from familiar kin, unfamiliar kin, familiar nonkin and unfamiliar nonkin in a playback experiment. We found limited support for recognition based upon familiarity: individuals appeared to be recognized from a period of prior association and associative learning. Focal birds (dominant females) discriminated familiar birds from unfamiliar birds, but discrimination was evident in only one of three behavioural response mea-sures. Focal birds did not discriminate familiar kin from familiar nonkin, nor did they discriminate un-familiar kin from unfamiliar nonkin, indicating no support for vocal recognition based on relatedness. The context of the experiment also affected discrimination, with focal birds reacting more strongly to calls from females (potential rivals) than to calls from males. Because familiarity in this species arises from the association of individuals in groups, and most groups comprise close kin, familiarity with group members offers a close proxy for kin recognition. While kin recognition systems based upon familiarity do not allow the identification of unfamiliar kin, the benefits of such recognition may be negligible in cooperatively breeding species that live in kin-based groups.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Individual variation in animal personality is ubiquitous, but little is known of its proximate causes. Theory predicts individuals will be more risk prone when their life expectancy is short, and adverse environmental conditions during development shorten life span. We modified developmental conditions of zebra finches, Taeniopygia castanotis, by manipulating parental foraging conditions to be either 'harsh' or 'benign' and studied offspring behaviour in adulthood using multiple tests: exploration, novel object, tonic immobility, dominance and sociality. Each test was done in duplicate, and repeatabilities of test scores ranged from 0.31 to 0.55 independent of treatment with one exception: tonic immobility was repeatable in individuals reared in harsh conditions only. Correlations between behaviours (i.e. behav-ioural syndromes) were generally weak and nonsignificant. Growing up in harsh conditions and in larger broods both negatively affected offspring growth and thereby presumably their life expectancy, but neither affected behaviour in standardized tests. This raised the question whether the origin of variation in personality was perhaps largely genetic, but heritability estimates were low to moderate. We conclude that variation in personality in our study can be attributed to environmental effects, but independent of early life adversity as manipulated here. To explain this finding, which runs counter to our expectation, we present two hypotheses. First, the adolescent social environment impacted the ontogeny of per-sonality, overshadowing developmental effects. Second, the risk associated with a behaviour may be state dependent, with identical behaviours encompassing a greater risk in low-quality than in high -quality individuals. Thus, while individuals with different developmental backgrounds displayed similar behaviour, the perceived risk this entailed may have been very different and in accordance with theoretical predictions. Given that we found no behavioural syndromes, a theory that assumes behav-iours to be correlated does not apply, and we discuss alternative functional explanations for individual differences in behaviour.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Copulations outside the pair bond are common among socially monogamous birds, but males differ in their extrapair siring success. A large body of research has focused on the ultimate causes and consequences of this variation, but the behavioural mechanisms underlying extrapair siring success remain poorly understood. Previous work showed that male songbirds that start singing earlier at dawn sire more extrapair offspring, suggesting that early morning activity influences the likelihood of obtaining extrapair copulations. However, this pattern may be confounded by male age, because adult males typically start singing earlier in the morning and have higher extrapair success than yearling males. We used data from an automated monitoring system to examine whether males' start and end of daily activity, that is, the time of exiting their roosting cavity in the morning and of entering their roost in the evening, relates to patterns of extrapair paternity in a population of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. In line with previous work, we found that adult males emerged earlier from their roosting nestbox and had higher extrapair siring success than yearling males, whereas paternity loss was unaffected by age class and timing of activity. However, the effect of early emergence on paternity gain was not simply due to age, because earlier emerging males had higher extrapair success even after controlling for variation in age class. Males that ended their activity earlier in the evening were also more likely to sire extrapair offspring, independently of their age class. We discuss potential mechanisms that can explain how the timing of activity influences extrapair mating success and highlight the need for experimental manipulation of the timing of activity to test the causality of the reported relationship.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Animal behaviour becomes essential to the dynamics of parasitism if some behaviours favour pathogen transmission or increase exposure to infection. Infections may also influence host behaviour when health and future fitness are compromised, which predicts infected individuals will adaptively change risktaking behaviours. We studied whether haemosporidian infection influences exploratory, foraging and antipredator behaviours of male young blackcaps before their first migration. The study was conducted in captivity using subjects of a medication experiment with the antimalarial drug primaquine, which had temporarily cleared parasite blood stages of treated individuals 1 month before. In an initial exploration test in a cage unknown to the birds, infected birds started exploring earlier than uninfected ones. Risktaking behaviours were further assessed in a sequence of tests starting with the opening of new feeders to induce a startle response, and continuing with simulations of increased predation risk. We first challenged birds with acoustic cues of predation risk by playing recorded conspecific alarm calls, using heterospecific song as a control for the reaction to sound. Then, we challenged birds with visual cues of risk, showing them a taxidermic sparrowhawk and a bottle as a control for the reaction to an unspecific threat. Uninfected birds showed appropriate sentinel behaviour, turning around more frequently in the presence of the sparrowhawk compared to the bottle, while infected birds tended to behave similarly when faced with both stimuli, a behavioural difference that was driven by individuals with single parasite infections. Throughout the trial, infected medicated individuals tended to alarm-call more often than infected unmedicated individuals, a weak effect of medication which was not observed in parasitefree birds. Our results show that haemosporidian infections can influence blackcap risk-taking behaviours and support the view that host behavioural repertoires are broadly associated with parasitism.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Territoriality (the defence of exclusive home ranges) is a strategy utilized within mammal populations to maximize individual fitness by monopolizing available resources. There is a trade-off, however, between acquiring the resources necessary for survival and reproduction and the cost of defending their exclusive use. Clarifying the sociospatial organization of wildlife populations is vital for understanding intraspecific competition and reproductive behaviour and, ultimately, conserving vulnerable or endangered species. We evaluated territorial behaviour in a solitary carnivore, the African leopard, Panthera pardus, under high-density conditions. We also assessed the influence of resource availability, sex-specific mating tactics and kinship on space sharing within the observed sociospatial structure. Both male and female leopards exhibited relaxed territoriality, with considerable intrasexual overlap occurring among both sexes, indicative of a risk aversion strategy. The risk of serious injury or death due to frequent territorial altercations in such a high-density system negated the benefits of strict spatial boundaries. Space sharing occurred more frequently in resource-rich areas: males overlapped more commonly in areas with high female density, and males and females overlapped more commonly in areas of high prey density. Males competed for access to females rather than monopoly of their home ranges; we hypothesize that the extralimital mating excursions undertaken by female leopards probably reduce the benefit of female monopoly (and consequently, of female defence) in this polygamous species. Space sharing among fe-males was primarily driven by kinship; related females exhibited greater overlap than unrelated females, suggesting kinship benefits to space sharing among mother-daughter pairs. The contributions of resource availability, sex-specific mating tactics and kinship towards creating conditions permitting relaxed territoriality illustrate the complexity of ecological, demographic and behavioural factors involved in the sociospatial organization of solitary carnivores.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Despite extensive research on passerine reproduction, it remains difficult to predict which traits of in-dividuals, nesting populations and landscapes drive extrapair paternity (EPP). Two broad categories of drivers, habitat structure and population level factors, have been considered separately or at a single spatial or temporal scale. We used a 6-year nesting data set of scissor-tailed flycatcher, Tyrannus for-ficatus, which have high rates of cuckoldry (73% of nests, 59% of nestlings), to explore how nest density, breeding synchrony, habitat structure and clutch initiation date affect EPP rates. We further considered synchrony at two temporal and habitat structure at two spatial scales. We predicted that visual occlusion from vertical habitat structuring on breeding territories would allow extrapair males to go unnoticed and provide cover for extrapair copulations. Predictions for effects of nest density and fertility synchrony were double-edged: EPP may either increase as extrapair mate availability and ease of comparison with social mates increases or decrease as social mates increase their efforts to assure paternity. Using Bayesian techniques, we found a combination of population level factors and habitat structure, including interactions among the latter, at different scales best accounted for variation in EPP. EPP declined with increasing population synchrony. Variation in EPP was also explained by fine-scale habitat measures, decreasing with increasing nest tree diameter at breast height and woody vegetation cover but increasing with tree density. Notably, EPP increased with a coarse-scale habitat measure, linear extent of fence or powerline, suggesting a role for human alteration of habitat. Fences are used as communal perches by neighbours and floater males, potentially increasing interactions between asynchronous individuals. Our study demonstrates that breeding synchrony influences the probability of EPP and that habitat structure on individual territories is a strong predictor of paternity that acts independently of breeding density or synchrony at our scale of measurement.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Anthropogenic change forces animals to navigate novel conditions, including evolutionary traps formed by decoupling cues from their previously evolved meaning. One underexplored feature that could drive variation in response to traps is social context. We looked at how group size influences the behaviour of western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, group members, including eating novel foods. Individuals in larger groups were faster to recover after experiencing a predator cue and faster to feed on known food items. Moreover, fish in larger groups were more likely to try novel foods, including microplastics, a common evolutionary trap. We also found evidence of a group level behavioural syndrome, in which a consistent proportion of individuals performed a behaviour across assays (i.e. resumed general activity following a predator cue, ate known food and ate novel food). Our results provide evidence that group size can influence the severity of an evolutionary trap and that, regardless of group size, group identity can have a strong effect on individual behaviour.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although wind is a ubiquitous component of ecological systems and might affect pheromone commu-nication, its effects have not been studied in depth. To test whether wind impacts trail pheromone behaviour, we studied the behaviour of the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex lobicornis in natural nests. We conducted observations under (1) unaltered scenarios with different wind intensities and (2) manipu-lative experiments aimed at altering trail-marking pheromone volatilization rates. In our manipulative experiments, we placed filter paper on ant trails, then removed the pheromone-marked paper 24 h later and either exposed or did not expose the marked paper to artificial wind (2 km/h) for 1 or 3 h. We then put the marked paper back on the trail and filmed ants' responses for 1 min. As controls, we filmed ants' responses to filter paper immediately before it was removed as well as their responses to new unmarked filter paper. We measured ant flux, speed and walking sinuosity of ants over trails and filter paper, the number of ants tapping their gaster against the substrate (an indication of pheromone-marking fre-quency), the number of head-on encounters among workers (as alternative modes of communication) and ant body size. Wind negatively affected ant traffic by decreasing ant flux and speed. Colonies increased the number of U-turns and head-on encounters among workers, with a higher response as wind exposure time increased, but trail pheromone deposition was constant among treatments. The size frequency distribution of foragers over the treatment area was skewed towards larger ants on trails with unmarked paper and on trails with paper that had been exposed to wind for 1 or 3 h or not exposed to wind but removed for 3 h. This could be the result of small ants focusing on pheromone trail mainte-nance, while larger ones focused on foraging on the filter paper irrespective of whether it had been marked. Our results suggest that division of labour and behavioural plasticity might allow leaf-cutting ants to mitigate the effects of wind on pheromone communication and continue foraging.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Successfully navigating a complex social environment can influence fitness (i.e. survival and reproductive success), which can cascade to outcomes in demography and population dynamics. Extensive research has focused on the mechanisms and drivers of fitness variation that result from differences in social structure and interactions, and separately, the effects of demography on population change. However, there have been few attempts to address the effects of social structure on population dynamics through demography. Here, we first review the effects of social structure and individual social position on fitness. We then address knowledge gaps, including the relationship between social structure and population dynamics, the carryover effects of social conditions, and the differential effects of social variables on specific demographic rates. We also review statistical tools and data requirements for the analysis of social networks and demography. We then propose that knowledge gaps could be filled by using joint modelling approaches. We used a simulation study to highlight the potential use of social networks to inform survival, a key demographic parameter. We developed a model that combines social network and survival (Cormack-Jolly-Seber) analyses and evaluated its performance to place inferences under different group structures and sampling scenarios using simulated data. Our results show that valid inferences on social and survival parameters and their connections can be achieved with realistic sample sizes, but precision is improved with more complete information (i.e. fewer missing individuals). Based on our review and simulation study, we suggest that further development of integrative modelling approaches can yield greater understanding and improved power to make predictions about the effects of social environments on populations and the feedback of population dynamics on social structure.

AB Male armaments are hypothesized to have evolved under intrasexual selection. Such traits may function as signals, weapons, or both, in male-male mating competition. Primate sexually dimorphic canine teeth and body size are two potentially weaponized traits whose function as a signal and/or weapon remains unclear, largely due to the difficulty of collecting detailed measurements of morphology on large free ranging mammals. Rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, are an interesting study system in which to investigate how such traits function because they experience relatively low levels of direct male-male mating competition compared to other members of their subfamily. Furthermore, male dominance rank is largely based on a queuing system rather than on the outcome of intermale aggressive encounters. We leveraged a novel data set of behavioural observations and morphometric data from free ranging rhesus macaques to investigate the function of sexually dimorphic canine teeth and body mass as weapons and/or signals. We tested whether canine height or body mass was correlated with dominance rank, whether similarity in any of these factors influenced the occurrence or outcome of agonistic interactions between male-male dyads and whether either of these traits predicted the likelihood of winning an agonistic interaction. Neither canine height nor body mass was related to dominance rank. Similarity in dominance rank, but not in morphology, predicted the occurrence of agonism between dyads. Agonistic encounters between males more similar in dominance rank were more likely to be characterized by aggression rather than submission. Dominance rank, but not canine height or body mass, predicted the likelihood of winning an agonistic interaction. Our results suggest that canine height and body mass do not confer a strong competitive advantage in male rhesus macaques and add to a growing body of evidence indicating that weaponized traits do not always seem to function either in fights or as signals in male-male combat.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID SHELL FIGHTS; SIGNALS
AB Skill, the ability to perform a challenging behaviour well, has been shown to be an important determinant of success in a variety of contexts, including human sports, animal courtship and, most recently, animal contests. Because skilful movement requires precise motor control, skill is assumed to be underpinned by traits that determine these abilities. However, while these traits determine an individual's potential to perform effective movements (known as technique), this potential may not translate into skilful fighting due to interference from the opponent. Here, we investigated the relationship between technique and skill using the European hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus. By examining the spatial distribution of shell raps, we found that, on average, technique exhibited during a 'training' fight predicted the level of skill displayed in a real contest. However, our results also demonstrated substantial among-individual variation in the direction of change across the two fights, with some individuals exhibiting better technique than skill and others showing the opposite pattern. Finally, we found that winners, but not losers, progressively adapted their targeting of strikes when faced with a fully functional opponent. Our results indicate that skill is a combination of innate technique and the ability to adapt to an opponent's behaviour. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB Communication signals are often key for encoding information on species identity, but determining the features important in conveying those cues is challenging. This is especially the case when attempting to compare across closely related sympatric taxa, where the need for accurate species recognition is critical. We developed an analytical framework to comprehensively quantify the complex movement displays used by male lizards to advertise territory ownership in 11 taxa of Puerto Rican Anolis, many of which were sympatric. Our analyses were able to assign the majority of individuals to the correct population of a given species based on only a handful of displays, showing ample information exists in these displays for species recognition. Instances where lizards were misassigned appeared to have occurred because of similarities in display design resulting from local adaptation to similar environments or recent shared evolutionary history. Our analyses also revealed there was no common ('magic') display characteristic for recognition across the 11 taxa. Instead lizards likely assess the entire display or a combination of different display cues. Taken together, we illustrate a powerful approach that offers a rigorous statistical and holistic evaluation of complex animal signals for elucidating features likely to be important in species recognition. We provide a guide for implementing this analytical framework in R, with associated code and worked examples. Information obtained from these analyses can then be used to design experiments testing the utility of identify cues or comparative studies investigating how those cues contribute to reproductive isolation among populations and ultimately speciation.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behaviours are challenging to describe. Here, we apply k-mer analysis to characterize complex courtship behaviours at four hierarchical levels: elements, displays, bouts and repertoires, on two species of hummingbirds and their hybrids. During courtship, male rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, perform three types of displays: shuttles (S), half pendulums (H) and rufous dives (R), while Allen's hummingbirds, Selasphorus sasin, perform four displays: S, H, Allen's dives (A) and the pendulum (P). Here we explore the behavioural sequences expressed by their hybrids, on a sample of displays from 35 Allen's hummingbirds and 46 rufous hummingbirds sampled far from their hybrid zone, compared against 306 wild male birds from a hybrid zone in Oregon and California, U.S.A. Among Allen's hummingbirds, hybrids and rufous hummingbirds, there was almost no variation in the kinematic elements that comprised displays. By contrast, the displays themselves, display sequences and repertoires varied substantially among these three groups. Some hybrids performed transgressive display variants in which kinematic elements of typical displays were missing or duplicated. This transgressive segregation implies the displays are under oligogenic control. We analysed display sequences using k-mer analysis, in which we binned display sequences into 3-mers (sequences of three). Typical 3-mers for Allen's hummingbirds included sequences PPP, PPA and SHP while typical 3-mers for rufous hummingbirds included SHR and RRR. The most defining characteristic of certain hybrids was their sequence variability: the display repertoire of some hybrids encompassed the repertoire of both parent species (e.g. performed both PPA and RRR) as well as 3-mer sequences never observed in either parent such as PRA. Such high withinindividual variability in hybrid phenotype differs from how modular morphological traits (such as flowers, feathers or hair) are expressed in hybrids. This within-individual variability may be unique to behaviour.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social animals face daily challenges to fulfil feeding, resting and social needs. In vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus, females are the core of the social group, in which relationships are mainly established and maintained through grooming. However, social relationships are not necessarily mutual or driven by the same interests. In a complex and diverse social environment, individuals may benefit from the ability to adapt their manoeuvring to different pressures. We experimentally manipulated the activity budget of two adult females (fed subjects) per group in four wild groups to investigate activity budgets, grooming behaviour variation and the implications for possible changes in social interactions. Specifically, we provisioned food to one fed subject at a time for 2 weeks (treatment), evaluated changes in their grooming behaviour before, during and after being fed, and compared their behaviour with that of the remaining adult females in the group (nonfed subjects) over the same period. In the provisioning phase, the fed subjects decreased feeding time, but increased resting and social time. We found that fed subjects increased their grooming strength and ratio of grooming given to received and showed preferences to groom existing partners, kin and adult females. Moreover, we found no carryover effect of provisioning on grooming strength after the treatment terminated. Our results demonstrate rapid social behaviour plasticity following manipulation of ecological conditions for specific female individuals, allowing for flexible shifts in grooming patterns that hint at Machiavellian-like adjustments that may help achieve social benefits through, at least partially, restructuring their social network when experimentally released from daily feeding obligations.

AB Identifying the factors that influence species diversification is fundamental to our understanding of the evolutionary processes underlying extant biodiversity. Behavioural innovation, coupled with the social transmission of new behaviours, has been proposed to increase rates of evolutionary diversification, as novel behaviours expose populations to new selective regimes. Thus, it is believed that behavioural flexibility may be important in driving evolutionary diversification across animals. We test this hypothesis within the primates, a taxonomic group with considerable among-lineage variation in both species diversity and behavioural flexibility. We employ a time cutoff in our phylogeny to help account for biases associated with recent taxonomic reclassifications and compare three alternative measures of diversification rate that consider different phylogenetic depths. We find that the presence of behavioural innovation and social learning are positively correlated with diversification rates among primate genera, but not at shallower phylogenetic depths. Given that we find stronger associations when examining older rather than more recent diversification events, we suggest that extinction resistance, as opposed to speciation, may be an important mechanism linking behavioural flexibility and primate diversification. Our results contrast with work linking behavioural flexibility with diversification of birds at various phylogenetic depths. We offer a possible dispersal-mediated explanation for these conflicting patterns, such that the influence behavioural flexibility plays in dictating evolutionary trajectories differs across clades. Our results suggest that behavioural flexibility may act through several different pathways to shape the evolutionary trajectories of lineages.

AB Animals are often exposed to changes in their environment that may be perceived as stressful, leading to an acute stress response, but to which they can eventually habituate. However, if habituation is prevented, for example due to the stressors being diverse and unpredictable in the timing and sequence of their appearance, a state of chronic stress may ensue. Organisms exposed to chronic stressors may show altered patterns of glucocorticoid hormone synthesis as well as changes in behaviour (e.g. activity and feeding), but the exact phenotypic effects of chronically stressful environments remain poorly understood. In this study, we exposed adult three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, to an unpredictable chronic stress protocol over a period of 67 days and measured their response in terms of waterborne cortisol levels and behavioural patterns. We quantified activity and feeding behaviour in two contexts: (1) when the stressors were applied and (2) during the resting period between stressors. We did not observe a significant cortisol elevation following a period of chronic exposure nor any change in cortisol levels in response to an acute stressor. The exposure of fish to chronic stressors led to a decline in latency to feed during the resting periods, indicative of an anticipation of future stressors. We observed an increase in activity levels of the stress-exposed fish, but only during the presentation of the stressors. Organismal response to protracted exposure to stressors is energetically expensive; thus, our results may indicate a trade-off between energy-demanding activities in fish subjected to a chronically unpredictable environment.

AB In group-living animals, behavioural contagion is associated with essential functions such as information acquisition and group cohesion. Studies have shown that several social factors (e.g. familiarity, dominance, the mother-offspring relationship) affect behavioural contagion. However, as previous research has focused mostly on play signals and yawning, it is unclear whether such social biases apply to all types of contagious behaviour. Using data from a group of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, we investigated the social biases associated with the contagion of vigilance. Our findings revealed that vigilance exhibited by a given individual was more contagious to lower-ranked than to higher-ranked individuals. In addition, vigilance was more contagious to mothers from their offspring than vice versa. Thus, the susceptibility to vigilance exhibited by others varies according to the social status of each individual and the relationship between each pair of individuals. By contrast, we did not find any effects of kinship on vigilance contagion. This implies that familiarity bias, which is often reported to be associated with the contagion of yawning and play signals, does not influence vigilance contagion. Overall, our findings indicate that behavioural contagion does not occur with equal likelihood but is affected by the interplay between the type of behaviour and social structures.

AB In human and nonhuman primates eye-to-eye contact (EEC), a face-to-face communication component, can promote emotional/attentional engagement and prolong affiliative interactions. Owing to its direct impact on fitness, the reproductive context is perhaps the most critical context for investigating EEC's importance. However, the presence of this phenomenon around mating and its functions in primates is still understudied. In this work, we investigated whether EEC was present during copulations and influenced the copula duration and postcopulation grooming occurrence in the wild gelada, Theropithecus gelada, an Old World monkey species. We found that the previous presence of the male 'look-at' triggered the female 'look-at'. Moreover, copulations were most likely to last longer in the presence of EEC. In addition, the occurrence of postcopulation grooming between partners, most frequently initiated by females, increased when copulations included EEC. Females' engagement in EEC with the male may be a form of continuation of female precopulatory proceptivity and facilitate males' copulatory activity. By prolonging sexual contacts, EEC may also increase the chances of ejaculation. By grooming their partners after mating, female geladas may attempt to reduce male arousal and prolong the social interaction with them, possibly strengthening their social bond. These results provide the first quantitative evidence that EEC is an effective mechanism for prolonging mating interactions and enhancing postmating affiliation in a Papionini species. On a broader perspective, the presence of EEC in an Old World monkey species suggests that EEC may have been favoured by natural selection to promote reproductive advantages during human evolution.

AB A wide range of species have been found to differentiate kin from nonkin. However, the ability to recognize kin, or the costs and benefits of discriminating kin from nonkin may depend on particular extrinsic environmental or intrinsic physiological conditions, resulting in context-dependent kin discrimination. North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, have previously been shown to be capable of discriminating the territorial calls of kin and nonkin. More recently, post hoc analysis of existing data suggested that kin discrimination might depend on the state of the caller (i.e. acute stress). Here we tested this hypothesis with independently collected data from a repeated-measures playback experiment and found no evidence in support of acute stress mediating kin discrimination. While squirrels were shown to register and respond to playbacks, exposure to a trapping/handling stressor in the caller had no effect on the receiver's response to the calls of kin and nonkin. Furthermore, we found no overall discrimination between the calls of kin and nonkin. These independently collected data instead suggest that the previous post hoc finding consistent with context-dependent kin discrimination was likely a spurious relationship associated with the data from which the post hoc hypothesis was generated rather than representing a real biological relationship. Our findings from this study emphasize the importance of testing post hoc hypotheses with independent experiments. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Phenomenological and behavioural studies have greatly advanced the study of natural selection. Field studies of selection well appraise the natural situation, but is this also true for laboratory studies, which are typically more mechanistic? We compared precopulatory sexual selection (mating differential based on pairing success) in field and laboratory of several closely related, ecologically similar black scavenger dung flies (Diptera: Sepsidae). Selection on fore femur (sexual trait) and wing size (nonsexual trait) and shape varied considerably among seven species and continental populations in agreement with variation in their mating system and sexual size dimorphism. Selection on trait size was mostly positive or nil, but never significantly negative, implying mating advantages of large males in most species. Strongest selection was found in species/populations with male-biased size dimorphism, associating evolutionary shifts from female- to male-biased dimorphism with intensified sexual selection for large male size by adding male -male competition to a mating system previously driven primarily by female choice. Although sexual selection on shape was closely aligned with allometric shape variation, selection on fore femur shape was more consistent than selection on wing shape, which was absent in most species. Sexual selection intensities, but not necessarily the underlying behavioural mechanisms, were overall similar in field and laboratory, suggesting that laboratory assessments well represent the natural situation. If this conclusion can be generalized, it would lend credence to the strategy of using controlled laboratory mating studies to better understand natural selection, behaviour and ecology, at least for smaller animals that can be held in captivity.

AB Among social foragers, individuals can actively search for and find food (the producers) or join already discovered food patches (the scroungers). Compared to scroungers, producers often occupy more dangerous outer spatial positions in the group, but they benefit from the finder's advantage, which is the amount of food eaten before the arrival of others. Scroungers may occupy safer positions but they face feeding competition when joining a patch already occupied by others. Here, we report factors influencing intragroup spatial position, feeding strategies and feeding success for a group of wild vervet monkeys, C. pygerythrus, at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda. We collected data using behavioural observations and field experimentation (N 1/4 132 trials) where we set up an artificial food patch with dispersed food rewards. We found that individuals who spent more time in the front-outer position of a moving group produced more. Producers that had a greater finder's time advantage (fed undetected by group members for longer periods) had a greater finder's advantage (consumed more food items before the arrival of other group members), and scroungers that arrived earlier had greater overall feeding success. We found that when the scrounger was higher ranking than other individuals at the patch, they used displacement scrounging (supplanted at least one individual from the patch to gain access to the food resource). However, feeding success did not differ between displacement scrounging and tolerated scrounging (when the scrounger fed at the patch with at least one other individual). Interestingly, we did not find higher-ranking individuals to have greater feeding success than lower-ranking individuals. Our findings corroborate previous studies showing that even among species with a linear dominance hierarchy and high occurrences of within-group contest competition, dominant individuals do not benefit from feeding advantages at large, dispersed food patches since they cannot monopolize the resource. Furthermore, our results emphasize the need to understand factors influencing feeding tolerance, particularly for subordinate individuals, who need to process ecological and social elements to maximize their food acquisition.

AB Within animal populations, behaviour often varies consistently among individuals, yet it remains unclear what generates and maintains this variation in ?animal personality?. To understand how multiple sources of variation might combine to promote interindividual differences in behaviour, we examined dispersal behaviour in a colonial spider, Cyrtophora citricola. We measured the repeatability of two behaviours in the laboratory that are associated with dispersal: latency to tiptoe (a dispersal behaviour in spiders) and latency to explore a new environment. We then tested five hypothesized sources of consistent variation across two generations of spiders: sex, food resources, transient internal states, heritability and parental effects. Spiders were modestly consistent in both latency to tiptoe and latency to explore. Males behaved similarly to females of the same size; however, males mature at a smaller size than females, and females became much more hesitant to tiptoe and explore as they grew. Food availability had no effect on either behaviour. Repeatability of exploration was higher within an instar than across instars, suggesting that some aspect of spiders' internal state, other than food, maintained relatively high repeatability over short periods. Tiptoe behaviour was significantly heritable for female relatives, but not for male relatives. For exploratory behaviour, siblings showed significant heritability, while parents and offspring did not, suggesting that early natal environments shared by siblings, rather than genes, might account for their similar behaviour. Finally, although food had no effect on the generation of spiders to which the diet was applied, poorly fed fathers had offspring that tiptoed more readily than well-fed fathers, suggesting paternal effects potentially transmitted through epigenetics. Tiptoe and exploratory behaviours were correlated within individuals, yet the overall modest interindividual variation in these two dispersal behaviours was maintained by disparate effects of different sources of variation.

AB Animals are often kept in conditions with low environmental complexity and for long periods in barren artificial environments. This has been shown to lead to poor welfare in many species of animals. We assessed the emotional responses of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus L., maintained for different intervals in a barren or enriched environment. Four groups of fish were tested individually for emotionality by inserting a novel object in the glass aquarium to assess behavioural responses, such as indicators of fear and exploratory behaviours. Fish kept for 7 weeks in barren environments showed behavioural indicators of fear in response to the novel object test performed in each isolated fish. Enriched environment increased the time investigating a novel object. The reduced time spent performing behaviours that indicate fear during the novel object test in fish kept in an enriched environment shows that the responses were a consequence of lack of stimuli, not necessarily social isolation. More complex environments improve the affective states and welfare of tilapia.& nbsp; (C)& nbsp;2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plastic behavioural adjustments represent a powerful mechanism for animals to respond to severe environmental changes. For instance, animals may use distinct resources, which could enhance their fitness, because of increased temperatures. Such shifts in resource use may be observed in egg laying female insects, modifying host plant preference under challenging conditions. Indeed, females are expected to increase their selectivity towards high-quality host plants when experiencing high compared with benign temperatures. In this study, we examined whether female Bicyclus anynana butterflies can enhance their reproductive performance by modifying host plant use in response to challenging temperature regimes. Towards this end, we investigated (1) whether exposure to variable thermal conditions affected reproductive output when females had access to only one host plant, and (2) whether this in turn affected the oviposition preference for host plants of different quality under laboratory conditions. We expected hot conditions to reduce the reproductive performance (egg number, offspring survival and performance) of butterflies. Such deleterious effects may, however, be counterbalanced by a higher selectivity for high-quality plants when females have simultaneous access to plants of different quality. We found that the reproductive performance of butterflies was indeed reduced when they experienced hot conditions. These temperature effects were only observed when butterflies only had access to a lowquality plant. However, individuals did not increase their selectivity towards the higher-quality host plant in response to hot conditions, possibly because of fecundity costs associated with increased choosiness. Our results illustrate the limits of plastic behavioural adjustments in response to changing environmental conditions under laboratory conditions. Further studies are, however, necessary to clarify whether this lack of plasticity is also observed in wild animals, which may limit their adaptability in the face of climate change. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB During separation, infants of various species often produce a special call type, the separation cry, which elicits instant response from the caregiver. Ignoring this stimulus might be costly; hence, adults have evolved a sensitivity to infant cries. As the acoustic structure and function of these vocalizations are conserved across mammals, adults might react similarly to heterospecific and conspecific separation calls. The domestic dog, Canis familiaris, is an excellent model to study reactions to heterospecific vocalizations due to their special niche in the human social environment. Through domestication, they have become especially sensitive to human communicative signals, including baby cries. Furthermore, they can share their natural environment with other species such as other pets and livestock, which could also affect their responsiveness towards heterospecific calls. Taking advantage of this potential cross-species sensitivity, we aimed to examine dogs' reactions to infant separation calls of humans and domestic cats, Felis catus, compared to conspecific calls. To explore the effect of novelty and specific acoustic features we also used synthesized cries, which allowed us to look for general rules behind dogs' reactions to heterospecific calls and general acoustic effects functioning across species. After testing 100 dogs with pup cries in a previous study, here we tested another 118 dogs in three groups based on the presented sounds' origin. All stimuli were analysed acoustically; then we tested the effects of the species and acoustic features on the dogs' behaviours. Dogs reacted to pup and artificial cries the fastest, and baby cries the slowest, while responses to kitten sounds were intermediate. We also found general acoustic effects: tonality-related parameters extensively affected the reactions. Higher noisiness caused faster speaker and owner orientation, but it seems that species-specific cues might overwrite the general acoustic rules that appear across mammal separation calls.

DE group behaviour; hydrodynamics; information transfer; schooling;
   shoaling; swimming efficiency
AB Spatial patterns in moving fish shoals originate from social interactions and are driven by factors that benefit individuals, such as predator avoidance or reduced energy expenditure. How shoaling is influenced by the presence and absence of a flow field is only partially understood. Adopting a reductionist approach, time spent shoaling, shoal structure and information transfer between pairs (the smallest subsystem of a shoal) of Eurasian minnows, Phoxinus phoxinus, were investigated in a recirculating flume in the absence (control) and presence of flow (low and high). Minnows spent more time shoaling under high-flow conditions. The pairs tended to swim in a tandem and side-by-side configuration under static and high flow, respectively, while under low flow, the neighbour's position was more uniformly distributed around the focal fish. Our approach involved analysis of fish accelerations and velocity correlations and indicated that, with the potential for hydrodynamic masking in flowing water, the relative positions adopted reflect the individual's propensity to increase information transfer with its neighbour by visual means so that an energy-efficient configuration can be maintained. Conversely, when the energetic benefits of a side-by-side configuration are lost in the absence of flow, fish limit the costs of the partial visual impediment (on one side) imposed by the presence of a close neighbour by employing a 'follow-the-leader' tactic.

AB Research into plumage ornaments and plumage signals of individual state has focused primarily on males, while variation among females has received far less attention. White patches of plumage around the eye (eye patches) are a female-specific plumage trait in the wood duck, Aix sponsa, a sexually dimorphic species of cavity-nesting waterfowl in North America. We observed considerable variation in the size of these patches among females and sought to evaluate whether this trait might indicate individual quality ('quality cost hypothesis') or the influence of stress or past investment ('stress indicator hypothesis'). We measured the area of female eye patches in five populations of wood ducks during three breeding seasons and examined whether eye patch area varied in relation to age, nest success, future breeding, activity and/or body condition. Eye patch area was highly variable among individuals but repeatable within individuals, varied across years and study sites, correlated strongly with age but weakly with an index of body condition. For individuals greater than 4 years of age, eye patch area was negatively related to the likelihood of returning to breed in the following year. Eye patch size was positively correlated with nest initiation date and this was more pronounced in older birds, but there was no correlation of eye patch area with clutch size or hatch success. Our results suggest that this unique female-specific plumage trait reflects individual age and future reproduction potential. Larger eye patches in older females may be an indicator of senescence or terminal investment, and we hypothesize that eye patch size could act as a signal of individual state or social status in this species.

AB Living in groups can benefit individuals in many ways, including in innovative problem solving. Several hypotheses have suggested mechanisms to explain why larger groups disproportionately outperform smaller groups, including the skill pool and pool of competence effects. However, disentangling these potential mechanisms from the effects of group size alone has been challenging. Here, we first outline key ways in which group size can shape performance in innovative problem solving. We then detail the nonlinear nature of the mathematical relationship between group size and various measures of group performance. Finally, we use simulations to confirm that measures of group performance in innovative problem solving scale nonlinearly with group size, even in the absence of any other effect. Our study provides guidance on how best to evaluate hypotheses about group composition on innovative problem solving, and clarity to help future studies make appropriate assumptions when developing null hypotheses against which to test their empirical data.

AB In polyandrous species males invest significant resources in producing large and high-quality ejaculates. As ejaculates are costly, males are expected to modulate their investment in response to social cues associated with the expected level of sperm competition or mating opportunity, to anticipate future mating conditions. Another consequence of ejaculate costs is that the increase in ejaculate production may be traded against traits linked to mate acquisition. In such cases, the effect of this anticipatory plasticity in ejaculate investment on a male's reproductive success will depend on the balance between postcopulatory benefits and precopulatory costs in the sociosexual context subsequently encountered. Here, we used the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a live-bearing fish characterized by intense sperm competition, to investigate how mismatches between anticipatory phenotypes and the social conditions subsequently experienced affect male reproductive success. Male guppies kept in visual contact with females, a social stimulus predicting high mating opportunities, increase their sperm production compared to female-deprived males which foresee fewer opportunities to mate, but simultaneously reduce their courtship rate. Using a paired experimental design, we manipulated the male's perceived mating opportunities by housing them in the presence (FP) or in the absence (FA) of females. We then measured male mating and insemination success under two conditions: (1) a female-biased sex ratio, matching expected FP cues; and (2) a male-biased sex ratio, matching expected FA cues. Under a female-biased sex ratio, mating and insemination success were not affected by previous exposure to females, although FP males experienced a lower risk of sperm depletion after several copulations. However, FP males showed a small, but significant, reduction in their mating success under a male-biased sex ratio, when directly competing with an FA male. Males showed significant repeatability in mating and insemination success within a sex ratio context, suggesting that the costs of mismatching anticipatory ejaculate responses are probably low in this species.

AB Animals use behavioural cues from others to make decisions in a variety of contexts. There is growing evidence, from a range of taxa, that information about the locations of food patches can spread through a population via social connections. However, it is not known whether information about their quality transmits similarly. We studied foraging behaviour in a population of wild songbirds with known social associations and tested whether flock members use social information about the profitability of patches to inform their foraging decisions. We provided artificial patches (ephemeral bird feeders) that appeared identical but were either profitable (contained food) or unprofitable (contained no food). If information about patch profitability spreads via social associations, we predicted that empty feeders would only be sampled by individuals that are less connected to each other than expected by chance. In contrast, we found that individuals recorded at empty feeders were more closely associated with each other than predicted by a null model simulating random arrival of individuals, mirroring a pattern of increased connectedness among individuals recorded at full feeders. We then simulated arrival under network based diffusion of information and found that the observed pattern at both full and empty feeders matched predictions derived from this post hoc model. Our results suggest that foraging songbirds use social cues only about the location of potential food sources, but not their profitability. These findings agree with the hypothesis that individuals balance the relative economic costs of using different information, where the costs of personally sampling a patch upon arrival is low relative to the cost of searching for patches. This study extends previous work on information spread through animal social networks, by suggesting important links between how individuals use information at different stages of the acquisition process and the emerging patterns of patch use at the level of the population.

AB Copying the mate choice of another conspecific by a bystanding observer is a socially mediated alternative mating strategy to independent mate choice. Because increased sperm competition is a potential cost of mate-choice copying, males should be prudent and less likely to copy the observed mate choice of other males when the latter are more sexually attractive than themselves. We tested this hypothesis using the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Focal observer males were simultaneously presented with a large and a small female as potential mates, either in the presence or absence of a nearby model male. We varied the relative differences in the body length and colour ornamentation, traits that predict male sexual attractiveness and competitiveness in the guppy, of observer and model males in each of three experimental treatments: (1) observer and model males were matched for body length and colour ornamentation; (2) the model male was larger and more colourful than the observer male; (3) the model male was smaller and less colourful than the observer male. We compared the mating preferences of focal observer males in each of the latter treatments with that of focal males in a control treatment, wherein no model male (and thus no copying opportunity) was present. As predicted, focal males copied the staged apparent mate choice of a model male in all three experimental treatments, but not in the control treatment. However, contrary to our a priori hypothesis, there were no significant differences in the likelihood or strength of the copying response in observer males among the experimental treatments. Although male guppies are known to modify their mating tactics in the presence of sexual competitors, we found no evidence for an influence of the relative phenotypes of observer and model males on mate-choice copying behaviour in focal observer males.

AB Parental aggression can be a costly behaviour and flexible based upon context. While defence of offspring from potential predators has been well studied in the convict cichlid, it is unclear why parents are aggressive towards other parental pairs who are not likely to be offspring predators. In this experiment we explore the aggressive behaviour of pairs towards parental pairs and nonparental individuals using experimental presentations in the field. We found that parental pairs showed more aggressive displays towards other parental pairs than towards nonparental individuals. Bites did not differ between treatments, but there was a sex difference in bites, with males preferring to bite males and females showing no preference. As a higher level of display was observed both in the presence and absence of fry, we also examined the pair response to fry alone. Focal pairs were more aggressive to stimulus fry that were larger than their own fry, indicating that the larger stimulus fry represented a risk to the focal pair, as predicted by previous findings on brood mixing. We conclude that pair aggression towards parental pairs is a means to prevent brood mixing, and the greater aggression shown towards parental pairs suggests that the risk to parental pairs of brood mixing is greater than that of fry predation by nonparental fish.

AB Wind is an important yet understudied environmental influence on foraging behaviour. We investigated the direct and indirect effects of wind on foraging worker honey bees, Apis mellifera. Bees were trained to an array of artificial flowers providing nectar rewards in a location sheltered from natural wind. To examine the direct effect, fans produced four different wind speeds between 0 and 3 m/s at three different flower spacings: 5 cm (flowers touching) and 10 cm and 20 cm (flowers not touching). To examine the indirect effect of wind moving flowers, flowers were moved 10 cm at three frequencies between 50 and 110 cycles/min at zero wind speed. We recorded the number of successful flower visits, time spent flying, search time on a flower and hesitancy to take off. Bees visited significantly fewer flowers with increasing wind speed which was caused by a significant increase in hesitancy to take off. This difference in flower visits between wind speeds was highest at the 20 cm spacing. Flower movement had no effect on foraging rate; however, there was a significant positive relationship between flower movement and the total time spent flying. This was counterbalanced by a significant reduction in time spent searching for the nectary after landing on a flower at the higher flower frequencies. Our results suggest that it is the direct effect of wind on hesitancy to take off that has the greatest effect on honey bee foraging rate. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The dot probe task is an experimental procedure commonly used to study how animals (including humans) pay attention to different stimuli. In this study, we evaluated how different durations of image exposure modulate the response to this task and how male and female tufted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp.) respond to a dot probe presented immediately after different social stimuli. Subjects were shown pairs of images of unfamiliar conspecifics: a male versus a female or two individuals grooming versus two individuals not engaged in grooming (nongrooming). With shorter image exposures (250 ms) both sexes showed shorter response times to the dot probe after presentation of (i.e. biased their attention towards) images of unfamiliar males compared to females, and did not show any bias towards images of grooming compared to nongrooming. With longer image exposures (1000 ms) females biased their attention towards images of unfamiliar females, while males did not show any difference; in contrast, males biased their attention towards images of grooming compared to nongrooming, while females did not show any difference. We interpret these results as showing that responses to the dot probe task with different image exposures reflect different attentional phenomena, and that the two sexes differ in how social stimuli affect their attention.

AB Increased turbidity, a common human-induced aquatic disturbance, can potentially have major impacts on predator-prey interactions via effects on key foraging and antipredator behaviours, on the repeatability of these behaviours (i.e. on animal personalities) and on behavioural syndromes (correlations among behaviours). Here, we repeatedly assayed individual western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, across a range of turbidity levels (low, intermediate, high) to test the degree to which a suite of behaviours (activity, exploration, sociality, responses to olfactory predator cues) scaled with increasing turbidity. In particular, we tested the a priori hypothesis, based on previous work, that fish show stronger behavioural repeatability and behavioural correlations when perceived predation risk is high. While individuals in all treatments responded to predator cues by reducing activity and exploration, those assayed in intermediate turbidity exhibited the strongest antipredator responses. Consistent with our prediction that repeatability should be greatest in high risk, significant behavioural repeatability was only detected in antipredator behaviours at intermediate turbidity. Significant correlations among behavioural traits were detected in all turbidity treatments but primarily under threat of predation - not when predator cues were absent (with one exception). This study demonstrates that levels of human-induced environmental change may interact with predation risk to shape both mean behavioural responses as well as patterns of behavioural correlations within and among individuals.

AB In cooperatively breeding animals, genetic relatedness among group members often determines the extent of reproductive sharing, cooperation and competition within a group. Studies of species for which cooperative behaviour is not entirely based on kinship are key for understanding the benefits favouring the evolution and maintenance of cooperative breeding among nonrelatives. In the cooperatively breeding chestnut-crested yuhina, Yuhina everetti, a songbird endemic to Borneo, we tested whether unrelated helpers are more likely to gain parentage than are related helpers consistent with the hypothesis that inbreeding risk constrains reproduction by related helpers. We also examined whether related or unrelated helpers provision broods more because of differences in their potential indirect or direct fitness benefits of helping. Kin structure of breeding groups (breeding pair and up to eight helpers of both sexes, median = 2 helpers, 96% of 57 pairs had helpers) based on genetic analysis was mixed; 48% of 76 breeder/helper dyads were first-order (26%) or second-order (22%) relatives of one or both members of the breeding pair, and 52% were nonrelatives. Only unrelated male and female helpers gained parentage, and helpers did not differ in their provisioning rate according to their relatedness to the broods. We documented quasi-parasitism or co-breeding by female helpers in 14% of 29 broods and extrapair paternity by male helpers in 21% of 47 broods. This rate of extrapair paternity is relatively high among the few tropical species examined but fit with predictions for mixed-kin groups where inbreeding is avoided. These findings support the emerging pattern for cooperative breeding in birds with mixed-kin groups, wherein unrelated helpers are more likely to gain parentage than are related helpers and helping effort is not necessarily predicted by kinship.

AB Studies of the cognitive abilities of animals aim to help us understand how they communicate, obtain resources, avoid danger and otherwise thrive in a given environment. But to what extent is cognitive ability a fixed trait in individuals? And can we answer this question by measuring performance on tests of cognitive ability? We tested the same 18 male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, once yearly, across three consecutive years, with tests of four putative cognitive traits and a test of neophobia. We also tested 19 females twice, once in the first year and once in the third year. All birds were hand-reared and tested in the laboratory. Analyses of both data sets indicate repeatability of neophobia but not of performance on the cognitive tests. In addition, correlations among cognitive performance, neophobia and song quality that were observed in the first year were not observed in subsequent rounds of testing. These results suggest that cognitive ability is not a fixed trait in individuals, or that the tests used do not accurately measure cognitive ability, or both. Conclusions drawn from a single round of cognitive tests should therefore be interpreted with caution in this species and in any species in which repeatability has not been verified.

AB Sperm quality and viability affect both male and female fitness. Most dragonfly and damselfly males translocate sperm from the testis to the seminal vesicle before each copulation, a behaviour known as intramale sperm translocation (ST). However, some published observations indicate that odonate males can occasionally skip ST prior to copulation. Our aim was to determine the circumstances under which males skip ST and how this might affect sperm viability. We allowed males of the damselfly Ischnura graellsn to perform ST (interrupting the copulation at this stage) and we studied ST behaviour during subsequent copulation. Males were randomly assigned to four treatments, which consisted of allowing the experimental male to copulate again 15 min or 1-3 days after his last ST. Fertility of females mated with the experimental males was analysed as a proxy for sperm viability. All males used the sperm that they translocated previously when the second mating took place 15 min after the manipulation, while the proportion of males that repeated ST increased steadily over time. Both treatment (time elapsed since last ST) and the interaction between treatment and ST (yes/no) had a significant effect on fertility, which decreased only in males that did not perform ST immediately before copulation. Additional experiments with damselflies of the genus Calopteryx showed also that males did not repeat ST when the time to the next copulation was less than a day. Our results suggest that sperm quality decays over time in odonates, and that males can choose whether to keep and reuse the sperm in the seminal vesicle or to discard it. We conclude that the special anatomical disposition of odonate males might increase selective pressures to maximize sperm viability and/or repeated intramale ST behaviour.

AB One of the most effective defensive strategies of hosts against brood parasites is rejection, commonly achieved by ejection of the parasitic egg or desertion of the parasitized nest. Nest desertion should be a costlier strategy than egg ejection, because birds must thesn spend additional time and energy renesting, and therefore we still cannot explain why some individuals desert their nests rather than eject parasitic eggs and continue a given breeding attempt. The great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, is a frequent host of the common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, and is known to use both types of rejection response. By measuring cuckoo egg mimicry, we investigated the hypothesis that the hosts desert if they cannot reliably recognize the cuckoo egg in their nest. We predicted that we would find better mimicry when hosts deserted rather than ejected. However, we did not find a difference in mimicry between these two groups of nests, implying that host females do not desert because they cannot reliably recognize the parasitic egg. We also showed that neither the date in the season nor the age of the host females influenced the type of rejection. Other factors potentially eliciting nest desertion, including host personality, host, inability to eject, excessive clutch reduction and visibility of the cuckoo female at the host nest, are discussed. Finally, we suggest that desertion may persist as a host defensive strategy against brood parasitism because it is not as costly as previously assumed and/or it is beneficial for host females in good physical condition.

AB Consistent individual differences in behaviour, also called behavioural types, are often observed in animal populations and can correlate to form behavioural syndromes. Behavioural types and syndromes have consequences in various fields of ecology, from species interactions to ecosystem services, notably through the role they can play in the slow-fast life history continuum. Individuals differ in their life history strategies along this continuum according to their relative investment in reproduction or survival, and the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis predicts a coevolution between these life history strategies and behavioural types linked to risk taking. In this framework, the aim of our study was thus to investigate the existence of behavioural types and their links with life history traits in the parasitoid hymenopteran Venturia canescens. We considered two behaviours, exploration and activity, that are linked to risk taking and resource acquisition, and three life history traits, longevity, egg load and offspring production rate. We found consistent individual differences in both exploration and activity. However, contrary to the predictions of the POLS, the behavioural types did not correlate with each other or with the life history traits tested. We thus found no evidence of a POLS in V. canescens. However, the existence of behavioural types in female parasitoids may be of utmost importance for biological control efficiency.

AB Much work has shown that social isolation has lasting negative effects on adult social interactions, but less is known about precisely how and why isolation alters social behaviour. One way isolation may alter social behaviour is by interfering with the development of effective communication. Here, we test how social isolation influences individual recognition, a key aspect of social communication in Polistes fuscatus paper wasps. Polistes fuscatus reared in a typical social environment learn and remember the unique faces of conspecifics during social interactions. Typical P. fuscatus use individual face recognition to minimize conflict and stabilize social interactions. As wasps are adept face learners, they also readily learn to discriminate between wasp face images during training. Here, we show that social isolation had dramatic effects on recognition. We isolated wasps for 6 days after eclosion from pupation, then tested them for face recognition in social and nonsocial contexts. Isolated wasps did not learn and remember other individuals during social interactions. Furthermore, isolated wasps did not learn to discriminate between wasp face images during training. Therefore, social experience with conspecifics is essential for the development of individual recognition and face learning in paper wasps. Many aspects of wasp behaviour develop rapidly with little experience required. However, complex social interactions like individual recognition require social experience with conspecifics.

AB Competition among foraging individuals of the same species occurs for several resources including, but not limited to, food, mates, nesting sites and, in parasitoid wasps, hosts. Individuals should therefore adapt their resource exploitation decisions accordingly and learning ability has been shown to be used in intraspecific competition situations to optimize fitness. We investigated the effect of interference and exploitative competition on aversive learning of a parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) as a model. We studied the effect of the presence of one to five competitors and of prior competitors, that is, the presence of parasitized hosts, on olfactory learning of wasps based on a Pavlovian conditioning system. We found that the odour of peppermint, which was previously positively associated with the reward of an oviposition, was rejected by females that experienced this odour while exploiting a patch of unparasitized hosts in the presence of conspecific females. Unexpectedly, the number of competitors in cases of interference did not increase the level of aversion to the peppermint odour. Thus conditioned stimuli previously encountered during the exploitation of a patch of parasitized hosts were rejected when females oviposited in the presence of unparasitized hosts. Our results suggest that intraspecific competition, by interference and by exploitation, acts as motivation for females to avoid stimuli related to competition; this may explain how an ideal free distribution can be reached by learning processes.

AB Both language and music are universal and characteristic for humans. The evolution of the cognitive abilities underlying language and music are widely debated. A core question is whether these abilities find their origins in a modification or extension of general cognitive abilities for processing auditory input also present in other species. If so, comparative studies of nonhuman animals should reveal similarities in processing abilities. In this paper, we review some examples of such studies. We focus on whether birds (in particular zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, and budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulates) can detect structural patterns based on relational rather than on physical similarities among auditory stimuli - an essential ability for processing and producing language and music. We briefly discuss why birds are suitable model species. Next, we discuss three domains of pattern detection: the ability to (1) detect 'grammatical rules' underlying sound strings; (2) perceive regular rhythms and (3) spontaneously group separate sounds into a larger pattern. In all of these there is evidence that birds show some ability to detect relational patterns. However, there is also variation between species: while budgerigars show relational rule learning, zebra finches attend to local physical similarities between sound strings used for training and testing. For rhythm detection, zebra finches and budgerigars show no clear differences. However, a broader comparison indicates that here too differences are present in the extent to which different bird species attend to relational patterns or to local features. Finally, spontaneous grouping of sounds was shown in zebra finches. The clear variation among bird species in their perceptual and cognitive abilities, in combination with their accessibility for experimental studies, provides opportunities to study the variation in auditory processing mechanisms and how these evolved. This may also provide hypotheses for the evolution of these abilities in humans. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Dispersal is a central mechanism in ecology and evolution. Dispersal evolution is driven by a trade-off between costs and benefits, which is influenced by interindividual variability and local environmental conditions (context-dependent dispersal). Many studies have investigated how dispersal decisions may be influenced by environmental factors, including density, predation and interspecific competition. Yet few have attempted to examine how habitat disturbance may affect the dispersal process in spatially structured populations. In early successional species, one might expect individuals to adjust their dispersal decisions based on two main factors that potentially have an influence on reproductive success: patch size and the level of patch disturbance. In this study, we examined how these two factors affect breeding success and dispersal decisions in an early successional amphibian, the yellow-bellied toad, Bombina variegata. To this end, we used capture-recapture data collected on a spatially structured population occupying 28 breeding patches. We took advantage of recent developments in multievent capture-recapture models to detect signs of context-dependent dispersal. The results revealed that the probability of successful reproduction and the number of newly metamorphosed individuals increased with both the size and the proportion of disturbance of a patch. In addition, our results showed that the factors affecting breeding success also influenced breeding dispersal probability. Large patch size negatively influenced emigration probability; in contrast, it positively influenced immigration probability. Equally, higher disturbance had a strong negative influence on emigration probability and slightly positively affected immigration probability. These findings strongly suggest that individuals make context-dependent dispersal decisions, adjusted to maximize future fitness prospects in a patch, allowing them to better cope with rapid changes in environmental conditions resulting from the ecological succession process. This opens new areas of potential research into the role of dispersal in organism specialization along an ecological succession gradient. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Unlike animals living in cohesive groups, those in groups with high fission-fusion dynamics can separate temporarily from other group members. While mechanisms underlying collective decisions are not well understood, it is possible that these separations occur by a divergence of interests between individuals. We evaluated the collective foraging decisions made by a group of Geoffroy's spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi, in a tropical forest in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. We assessed whether each individual's centrality in the social network, years living in the group, age, sex and social relationships affected the collective decisions. We examined two collective dynamics: foraging movements and arrivals to novel food patches, and in the latter, identified knowledgeable and naive individuals. In both dynamics, spider monkeys exhibited partially shared leadership influenced by individual attributes, particularly the centrality in the social network, age and time in the group. These attributes have been associated with ecological knowledge. In arrivals to novel food patches, individuals most likely to have information about food resources (i.e. central individuals and males) had a greater likelihood to be followed, suggesting an influence of social information on the tendency to follow others. Also, we show evidence that social information could accelerate the arrival of naive individuals to these patches. Collective foraging dynamics in our study group seem to arise from local rules that each individual follows when foraging: when a naive individual needs social information to forage, it will follow the individual that is more likely to have this information, i.e. a central individual or a male; otherwise, when it is not possible or necessary to use social information, naive individuals will follow a partner with which they have a strong social relationship. Thus, the interaction between local decision rules and the structure of the social network could drive collective coordination in fission-fusion dynamics.

AB Agonistic behaviour is an important component of intraspecific competition because outcomes of agonistic contests can serve as indicators of fitness, helping the victors secure critical resources. Although several factors affecting aggression, including age and body size, have been well documented, few studies have examined the effects of abiotic factors on aggression and outcomes of agonistic contests. Abiotic factors affect a broad range of behaviours and can naturally covary, but some factors are becoming increasingly uncoupled. For example, ongoing climate change continues to shift temperature, but not light:dark, cycles. Thus, we employed a 2 x 2 factorial design in sand field crickets, Gryllus firmus, to disentangle the naturally covarying effects of temperature and circadian rhythms. During early adulthood, virgin males were maintained in either a typical or inverted diel temperature cycle (i.e. cool in the morning and warm in the afternoon, or warm in the morning and cool in the afternoon, respectively) reflecting field conditions (20.5-32 degrees C). Agonistic contests occurred at either cool (22 degrees C) or warm (31 degrees C) periods in the temperature cycle. Morphological traits, such as head width, femur length and testes mass, positively covaried and influenced the outcome of contests where relatively large crickets won most contests. However, temperature and time of day had additive, interactive effects on the level of aggression and the duration of contests. Contests occurring in cool, morning conditions were relatively long and aggressive. Although crickets appeared to use a mutual assessment strategy (contests between males of mismatched body size took longer to initiate), there may have been a context-dependent shift to a self-assessment strategy during warm evenings. Thus, plasticity in agonistic behaviour occurred due to the interactive, additive effects of temperature and circadian dynamics. We encourage continued investigation into studies that disentangle the effects of temperature and circadian effects on other fitness-related behaviours, such as mate choice or foraging.

AB The study of the emotional and cognitive consequences of social interactions plays a critical role in the understanding of the dynamics of social relationships and reciprocity. In this study, we developed an attention bias test for tufted capuchin monkeys, Sapajus sp., that required no training, and applied it to evaluate the consequences of receiving aggression. Subjects were given food in the presence of an aggressive dominant bystander or a nonaggressive subordinate bystander. A transparent partition separated the two individuals to prevent physical contact. After this phase, subjects were presented with two images of familiar humans. One of the images (the threatening stimulus) showed one of the laboratory technicians wearing capture gloves and holding a capture net; the other (the neutral stimulus) showed one of the students of our laboratory. At the base of each stimulus was a reward (half a peanut). We recorded the choice made by our subjects (which reward was taken first) as well as the latencies to take each reward. Shorter latencies to take a reward were taken as an indication that the attention of the subject was drawn to the corresponding stimulus picture. We found evidence of an attention bias related to the experimental treatment: subjects chose the reward under the threatening stimulus faster and more frequently in the postaggression condition. These findings suggest the existence of attention bias modulated by social interactions in capuchin monkeys. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB When changing environments make the primary sensory modality less useful or reliable, animals may shift their reliance to a different sensory modality. However, such plasticity in sensory modalities may be unlikely outside of critical developmental periods or may depend on the type of behaviour associated with the sensory response. Animals' previous experience with a particular environment and its influence on the reliability of cues may also constrain the occurrence of sensory shifts. Here, we ask about the impacts of changing environments that occur during adulthood on sensory behaviour. Specifically, we housed adult zebrafish, Danio rerio, for 6 weeks either in constantly clear water, or in water that was periodically turbid. We then compared the two groups in terms of their (1) response to a reflexive optomotor stimulus, (2) choice for visual versus olfactory cues in a foraging context and (3) social behaviour. We found that fish with experiences in the turbid context responded less robustly to a reflexive visual stimulus and responded to olfactory as opposed to visual cues as the first choice, suggesting a shift in their primary sensory modality. However, other behavioural measures (e.g. shoal cohesion, charge rate, activity level) depended more on the context in which they were measured than on recent experience. Taken together, these results suggest that recent experiences in particular physical contexts may impact the use of different sensory modalities and visual physiology, but that these effects depend on the type of behaviour being considered. These compensatory shifts between sensory modalities may help animals to buffer other forms of behaviour from major changes in the environment.

AB General calls are present in the vocal repertoire of a great number of animal species. Because of their lack of context specificity, they are typically argued to possess blurred meaning, or even no meaning at all. Although recent animal cognition studies have demonstrated a growing interest in these vocalizations, there is currently no clear definition of general calls, and their meaning is seldom discussed. Here, we propose a definition of general calls, and review various hypotheses regarding their meaning, focusing on alert contexts. We first discuss the hypothesis that general alarm calls have a general alert meaning. Second, we review an alternative view, that general calls in fact have a specific meaning. With this review, we encourage further research that could help delve into the mechanisms underlying vocal production and comprehension and would improve our understanding of general and specific calls in animals.

AB Small animals usually have relatively larger brains than large animals. This allometric brain-body size scaling is described by Haller's rule. However, one of the smallest known insects, Trichogramma evanescens, a parasitic wasp, shows brain isometry, leading to similar relative brain sizes in small and large conspecifics. The somewhat larger Nasonia vitripennis parasitic wasp displays diphasic brain-body size scaling with isometry in small individuals and allometry in large individuals. These two species may have undersized brains for small wasps, with reduced cognitive abilities. Here, we induced intraspecific body size variation in genetically identical T. evanescens and N. vitripennis and examined cognitive trade-offs of brain scaling. We compared visual and olfactory memory retention between small and large conspecifics. Results showed that diphasic brain scaling affected memory retention levels in N. vitripennis, whereas isometric brain scaling did not affect memory retention in T. evanescens. The two species may experience different evolutionary pressures that have shaped the cognitive consequences of isometric brain-body size scaling. A possible trade-off of brain isometry in T. evanescens could be present in brain properties other than memory performance. In contrast, it may be more adaptive for N. vitripennis to invest in other aspects of brain performance, at the cost of memory retention. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The use of multiple sensory modalities in mating decisions has prompted a reassessment of sexual selection in many species. Odonate males have long been assumed to use only visual cues in mate recognition. Using only airborne cues in the laboratory, a previous study of Ischnura elegans found that males discriminate between the sexes and exhibit an odour preference for male-like female colour morphs. In a field experiment that required free-flying males to detect and recognize potential mates, we scored nonsexual and sexual reactions of free-flying males to live conspecifics (andromorphic females, which mimic male body colour and pattern; heteromorphic females, which differ from males in body colour and pattern; and males) and empty control dowels positioned at ponds. 'Nonvisual' treatments concealed under a muslin bag offered only olfactory cues, whereas the unbagged 'visual' treatments offered visual plus odour cues. Live conspecifics in the nonvisual treatments did not elicit more sexual reactions than control dowels. In contrast, live individuals in the visual treatment elicited more sexual responses than did controls, suggesting that odour alone was insufficient for detection of conspecifics. However, even with visual cues, males reacted sexually towards other males as often as they did towards either female morph, indicating a failure to discriminate between sex or morph. A second, more realistic visual treatment away from water, where 77% of the solitary mature individuals were males, produced similar results. Thus, we measured natural harassment rates of marked, free-flying females. Both female colour types used similar behaviours to evade males. We found no difference in harassment or mating rates between colour morphs. Our results suggest that visual cues of female I. elegans act similarly to the context-dependent signal apparency of Enallagma colour morphs, and emphasize the need for laboratory results to be validated by comparison of sensory abilities under natural conditions.

AB Animals frequently make decisions based on social information obtained from other animals, which can influence interspecific interactions and affect individual fitness. For example, animals eavesdrop on other animals to find profitable food resources, yet the types of cues they use and how these cues influence decisions to approach a resource remain poorly understood. In tropical systems, arthropods inadvertently flushed by army ant, Eciton burchellii, swarms are an important food resource for many bird species, which form mixed-species foraging aggregations at swarms. Competition at swarms is intense and birds vocalize to defend foraging areas, inadvertently producing acoustic social information about the swarm's location. Eavesdropping birds may use these acoustic cues, which provide information about the bird aggregation (i.e. species participating in the aggregation, the size of the aggregation and/or diversity of the aggregation) to assess potential benefits (food resources) and costs (competition for food) of joining an aggregation. To test this hypothesis, we used an acoustic playback experiment to simulate aggregations of birds foraging at ant swarms and we measured community-wide and guild-specific responses of forest birds to playbacks. We included three types of acoustic social information in playbacks that potentially interact to affect an eavesdropping bird's probability of attraction to a swarm: (1) aggregation size, (2) aggregation species richness and (3) degree of specialization on ant swarms for food of birds vocalizing in the aggregation (hereafter 'dependency'). Using Bayesian generalized linear mixed models, we found that playbacks of obligate ant-following species elicited greater community-wide responses (i.e. attracted more individuals and species) to simulated aggregations compared to playbacks of other, less dependent guilds. We also found that interactions between dependency, species richness and aggregation size influenced the overall community response to playbacks and that species from one guild generally responded to the guild above them (i.e. from less to more specialized). Our results suggest that species evaluate multiple types of acoustic cues representing the costs and benefits of foraging in a mixed-species aggregation at a swarm. We hypothesize that species change from information receivers to information producers upon joining a swarm, ultimately producing an information cascade that further affects the dynamics of feeding aggregations at swarms.

AB Acoustic communication is vital to complex social behaviours such as territorial defence. The use of ultrasonic vocalizations, particularly in territorial defence by monogamous species and females, remains understudied. We studied ultrasonic vocalization production and associated aggression in the monogamous, biparental and territorial California mouse, Peromyscus californicus, in which both males and females were found to display similar levels of physical aggression against same-sex intruders. We identified specific ultrasonic vocalization calls that are modulated based on social context: (1) sustained vocalizations, which are long, low-bandwidth calls ranging from 22 to 25 kHz, and (2) barks, which are short, high-intensity calls beginning and ending in the audible range. Despite similarities in physical aggression, sex differences emerged in vocal communication. Only resident males, and not females, produced sustained vocalizations prior to the onset of physical aggression, and were found to shorten the duration of individual sustained vocalization calls over both the course of the pre-encounter phase and from the pre-encounter to encounter phase. In addition, the degree of sustained vocalization shortening in males predicted offensive aggression of the resident. Males exhibited shorter sustained vocalization calls during encounters than females. Barks occurred more frequently during female-female physical aggression than in male-male encounters, and correlated highly with defensive aggression by intruders. Finally, a newly identified highly complex call, sweep phrases, was recorded in a subset of both sexes in the pre- and post-encounter phases. The overall results indicate that ultrasonic vocalizations may play an important role in territorial defence during both territorial advertisement and aggression in a monogamous rodent. Overall, this monogamous species showed sex similarities in physical aggression but sex differences in vocal communication and a more sophisticated function for sustained vocalizations than previously recognized.

   EXAMPLE; GROUP-SIZE; INFORMATION
AB For social foragers, movement as a group could increase foraging efficiency through collective discovery of high-quality food sources. This would require an efficient mechanism for transferring information about food quality between individuals. Conversely, the constraints of foraging as a cohesive group could decrease efficiency; grouping may persist to serve other functions such as protection from predators. To test what drives cohesion in herbivores, we manipulated patch shape and within-patch pattern of food quality and quantified the effects on group level diet selection by a social herbivore, the fallow deer, Dama dama. We arranged feeders containing fodder in lines or blocks, and manipulated the pattern of food quality within patches by adding tannin, a plant secondary compound that decreases palatability. We quantified the relative consumption of low- and high-tannin food to compare diet selectivity at the group level between patch treatments. If group foraging evolved to increase foraging efficiency, altering the spatial arrangement of food should not affect diet selectivity because information about food location and quality is shared. We found, however, that the herd expressed different levels of selectivity between both patch shapes and food quality patterns. Deer selected better diets in blocks than lines. In lines, the herd selected better diets when quality varied between alternate feeders rather than between the two halves of the patch, suggesting a reliance on personal rather than group information. Deer consumed the most at patch centres in all treatments except in blocks with high-tannin centres, but diet selection was poorer in the latter compared to blocks with low-tannin centres. Aggregation at the centre of patches appears to have restricted exploitation of the best food. Predation pressure and/or resource variability may have favoured the evolution of a foraging strategy that prioritizes social cohesion over effective diet selection.

AB To understand the complexity involved in animal signalling, studies have mainly focused on repertoire size and information conveyed in vocalizations of birds and nonhuman primates. However, recent studies on gestural abilities of nonhuman primates have shown that we also need a detailed understanding of other communicative modalities and underlying cognitive skills to grasp this phenomenon in detail. Here, we thus examined gestural signalling of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, living in two communities in the wild (Kanyawara, Uganda; Tai South, Cote d'Ivoire) with a special focus on the influence of the social environment on signal development. Specifically, we investigated to what extent specific social factors, namely behavioural context, interaction rates and maternal proximity, affect gestural production (i.e. gesture frequency, sequences and repertoire size). We used a combination of video recordings and focal scans obtained from 11 infants aged between 9 and 69 months during 1145 h of observation throughout two consecutive field periods. Overall, we found that social play was the context in which the highest number of gestures occurred. While gesture frequency and repertoire size increased with higher interaction rates with nonmaternal conspecifics and the number of previous interaction partners, no effect was found for interaction rates with mothers. Our results thus imply that infants of social mothers may have a head start in life. Moreover, we provide hitherto undocumented evidence for sex differences in gestural signalling, which may reflect the differential importance of early socialization for chimpanzee males and females. Gestural development thus relies heavily on interactional experiences with conspecifics, which adds support for gestural acquisition via the learning mechanism of 'social negotiation' in great apes.

AB In animal societies, conflict within groups can result in eviction, where individuals are often permanently expelled from their group. To understand the evolution of eviction and its role in the resolution of within-group conflict requires information on the demographic consequences of eviction for individuals and groups. However, such information is usually difficult to obtain because of the difficulty in tracking and monitoring individuals after they are evicted from their natal groups. Here we used a 15-year data set on life history and demography to investigate the consequences of eviction in a tractable cooperatively breeding mammal, the banded mongoose, Mungos mungo. In this species, groups of individuals are periodically evicted en masse and eviction is a primary mechanism by which new groups form in the study population. Following eviction, we found sex differences in dispersal distance: some females established new groups on the study peninsula but males always dispersed away from the study peninsula. Evicted females suffered reduced reproductive success in the year after eviction. For the evicting group, eviction was associated with increased per capita reproductive success for females, suggesting that eviction is successful in reducing reproductive competition. However, eviction was also associated with increased intergroup conflict for the evicting group. Our results suggest that within-group conflict resolution strategies affect group productivity, group interactions and the structure of the population, and hence have fitness impacts that reach beyond the individual evictors and evictees involved in eviction.

AB Echolocating bats can navigate to salient places relying solely on their sonar system. Currently, much about the mechanism underlying sonar-based navigation in bats remains unknown, and no computational models of this ability have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a computational model of sonar-based navigation in bats. In particular, we advance a model explaining how bats could assemble a cognitive map from their environment using only their sonar readings. The model consists of two loops. The first loop performs low-level obstacle avoidance. This gives rise to stable and environment-derived flight corridors (i.e. preferred pathways for bats flying through the environment). The second high-level loop runs on top of the low-level loop and performs mapping. Mapping is done by combining local view information extracted from echo signals with local self-motion information to recognize previously visited places and memorize their spatial relationships. Using this model, we simulate a bat exploring unstructured environments while constructing a cognitive map using a biologically plausible algorithm. The model we propose allows the simulated bat to construct a global map of its flight paths through the environment without the bat ever reconstructing the three-dimensional layout of the local environment from any of its received echo signals. Indeed, neither the obstacle avoidance strategy that guides the bat through space nor the mapping algorithm requires the three-dimensional geometric structure of the environment to be accessible to the bat.

AB Precopulatory mate guarding (PCMG) is frequently presented as a classic case of sexual conflict between partners. For instance, long-lasting PCMG is regarded as an adaptive male strategy to secure a female in a context of strong intrasexual competition, while females guarded for a long time are assumed to bear many costs. This assumption has been derived from guarding systems where females obviously resist males' attempts to initiate early guarding. However, females of some species such as the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex do not seem to possess adaptations to reduce PCMG duration, which remains to be explained from an evolutionary perspective. In this model organism for sexual conflict research, a male grasps a female several days before her sexual receptivity. Here we tested the hypothesis that G. pulex females might benefit from being passively transported by their partner during PCMG, whereas the male alone bears the costs of swimming while carrying his mate. We therefore compared the energetic states of paired and single individuals and found that, after 5 days of PCMG in controlled conditions, paired individuals contained more protein, lipid and glycogen reserves than single individuals in both sexes. Our results suggest that PCMG might be energetically beneficial not only to the female, but also to the male. We discuss overall fitness consequences of PCMG for both partners given the mutual benefits we highlighted here. We plead for a more precise estimation of the cost/benefit ratio for each sex to improve our understanding of how sexual conflict shapes guarding patterns.

TI Taxonomic bias in animal behaviour publications

DT Article
DE behavioural ecology; citation bias; 'model' taxa; publication skew;
   taxonomic prejudice
ID PREJUDICE; ATTITUDES
AB Evidence suggests that certain taxonomic groups are more thoroughly studied than others across a wide range of biological disciplines. Such taxonomic biases have the potential to define our understanding of theory, and limit the generality of our insights. To assess the distribution of taxonomic representation in current and historical animal behaviour research, we constructed a data set containing article metrics and taxonomic information for all research articles published in the journal Animal Behaviour between 1953 and 2015. We found significant taxonomic bias, with chordate papers making up 70% of all publications in the past 15 years, despite accounting for less than 7% of all animal species. Within chordates, Animal Behaviour content is biased towards endotherms, with birds and mammals comprising more than 50% of all publications. In sum, six animal orders account for more than half of all publications, with the most commonly published order, Passeriformes, representing one in five articles. Our findings confirm that a relatively narrow group of ` model' taxa represent the vast majority of articles, and may have a disproportionate influence on our understanding of behavioural patterns and processes. Furthermore, we find evidence of a citation bias, with chordate studies receiving on average four citations more per paper than arthropod studies. While historical trends suggest that the publication gap between arthropods and chordates has been shrinking for the past 45 years, our findings show that a considerable bias still remains. These biases may originate from human preferences for certain animal types, but we argue that they are likely maintained by a mixture of taxonomic prejudices, cultural aspects of behavioural ecology as a field, and of academia in general. We suggest that the patterns are clear and their implications serious, and that it is time that both researchers and journals give serious consideration to addressing them.

AB Theoretical models of injurious animal contests, such as the cumulative assessment model (CAM), predict that an individual's decision to give up and retreat from a fight is determined by reaching a maximum cost threshold (C-max). Under this model, an individual gives up when the accumulated costs of persisting exceed this threshold. CAM predicts that the velocity with which C-max is reached depends on both the energetic (physiological) costs of remaining in the fight and the damage costs of injuries received. Here we propose that damage costs are accumulated not only by receiving injuries, but in some cases also by inflicting injury (attacking). We argue that these self-inflicted damage costs need to be incorporated into theoretical frameworks to fully understand what drives an individual to make the decision to give up, and we call for further research into this area.

AB Sociability, how individuals interact with conspecifics, is considered to be a key axis of animal personality. Consistent differences between individuals in measures of sociability have been demonstrated in some taxa, yet individuals also exhibit plasticity in their sociability across differing ecological conditions, particularly in gregarious species that do not occur in stable cohesive groups. Although repeatability and plasticity of measures of sociability are both important for understanding animal personality they have rarely been studied concurrently. Between and even within species, multiple behaviours have been considered to represent sociability, but there is still little understanding of the degree to which different measures of sociability reflect distinct traits. In this study, our first aim was to determine the repeatability of four different measures, representing two broad aspects of individual females' sociability, in a wild population of eastern grey kangaroos, Macropus giganteus. Our second aim was to investigate how shorter-term environmental conditions and individuals' states related to plasticity in these measures. Using data collected each month over a 5-year period on over 100 adult females, we analysed factors contributing to variation in individuals' grouping patterns (to reflect general gregariousness) and in the number of different conspecifics with which individuals associated (their 'choosiness' of social partners). Rainfall, body condition and reproductive state were all related to females' mean group sizes, and females with older dependent young foraged further from their neighbours. Females were more selective about group members when there was more food, and when they were in poor or excellent body condition. Although social preferences exist among females in this population, and females' measures of sociability are repeatable and differ between individuals over the long term, these current findings suggest that the influences of individuals' states and environmental conditions contribute to variation in females' patterns of sociability over shorter periods.

AB When humans escape from a threat in a crowded space, how do they choose the best wayfinding strategy for their survival? This is a decision context in which individuals are heavily exposed to the actions of others; it is thus plausible to assume that they are influenced by the social interactions. It has been suggested by some influential theoretical studies that in emergency escape situations, 'people show a tendency towards mass behaviour, that is, to do what other people do' (Helbing, D., Farkas, I., Vicsek, T., 2000. Simulating dynamical features of escape panic. Nature, 407, 487-490, page 487). However, the validity of this assumption has not come under scrutiny, nor has the role of context-specific factors that may strengthen or weaken the possibility of displaying the so-called herd-type (or imitative) behaviour been adequately understood in this context. Here, we report on novel wayfinding decision experiments that simulated the escape of human crowds from multi-exit spaces. Participants' perceptions of different contributing factors were quantitatively inferred from their observed choices (N = 3015) using econometric modelling methods. Results showed that the direction at which the social interactions (i.e. observing the movements of other evacuees towards different exit alternatives) impacted on individuals' navigational choices depended significantly on the decision maker's knowledge about the attributes of the alternatives chosen by the crowd flows. Contrary to the conventional belief, people's dominant wayfinding strategy was not to copy the escape directions that other people (i.e. the majority) chose. In fact, in a heavily crowded space with little or no choice uncertainty, observing many people choosing a certain exit direction reduced the desirability of that escape route. The assumption of herd-like behaviour does not necessarily apply to all contexts of evacuations and it should be considered in conjunction with the moderating role of context-specific factors, particularly the level of information available to individual evacuees.

AB Prey animals that possess chemical defences often advertise their unprofitability to predators by a distinctive and conspicuous visual appearance known as aposematism. However, not all chemically defended species are conspicuous, and some are nearly cryptic. Differences in predator community composition and predator behaviour may explain varied levels of prey conspicuousness. We tested this hypothesis by measuring dietary wariness and learning behaviour of day-old chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, from four strains of laying hens that have been selected for different levels of egg productivity. We used these strains as model predators to test whether predators that vary in the trade-offs associated with foraging behaviour cause differential survival of chemically defended prey with conspicuous signals. We found that strains differed in how they learned about chemically defended prey, which resulted in significant differences in prey survival. The selection pressures imposed by different types of predator could explain whether chemically defended prey evolve varied levels of conspicuousness. Predators' initial wariness of novel prey was not related to learning at the strain or individual level, but predator wariness increased after exposure to chemical defences. Our study provides support for the hypothesis that the evolution of prey defences depends on variation between ecological communities in predator learning behaviour and experience.

AB Motor performance describes the vigour or skill required to perform a particular display. It is a behaviourally salient variable in birdsong and other animal displays, but little is known about within-individual variation in performance over short timescales. The metric 'frequency excursion' (FEX) quantifies birdsong performance as cumulative frequency modulation per unit time. We measured FEX in a large sample of recordings from free-living male Adelaide's warblers, Setophaga adelaidae. Our objectives were to quantify natural variation in performance and test the hypotheses that performance (1) improves as a function of recent practise, (2) decreases over consecutive repetitions of a single song type, (3) improves with rest between songs, (4) varies by singing mode and (5) changes during vocal interactions with neighbours. We found significant variation in performance among individuals and song types. Consecutive repetition of a song type, rest between songs, singing mode and vocal interaction did not strongly affect performance. Performance consistently increased with song order, however, indicating that males warm up during morning singing. This is the first demonstration of such an effect in a sexual display. The warm-up effect may explain the prevalence of intense dawn singing in birds (dawn chorus), if rivals engage in an arms race to warm up. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Over 40 years ago, Peter Marler proposed that animal signals were adaptive because they provided listeners with information ( Marler, 1961, Journal of Theoretical Biology, 1, 295-317). But what was the nature of this information? How did it influence behaviour? And how might the information in animal signals compare with the information in human language? Here we review evidence that signals in a variety of social contexts are adaptive because they convey information. For recipients, meaning results from the integration of information from the signal and the social context. As a result, communication in animals - particularly in long-lived, social species where the same individuals interact repeatedly - constitutes a rich system of pragmatic inference in which the meaning of a communicative event depends on perception, memory and social knowledge. In the human lineage, pragmatics served as a precursor to the later evolution of semantics and syntax. Among primates, there is a striking difference in flexibility between constrained call production and more flexible perception and cognition. However, call production is more flexible in the wild, where it is affected by contextual cues, than in laboratory studies where contextual cues have been removed. Monkeys and apes may overcome the limits of constrained vocal production by producing composite signals in the same and different modalities.

AB An emerging focus of behavioural ecology is to determine the driving forces behind animal personalities. While numerous theories have been proposed to explain these behavioural variations, empirical studies on this subject remain lacking. Here, we test ecological theory by studying the combined effects of physiological condition and habitat quality on the behaviour of individual mud crabs, Panopeus herbstii, across the spawning season (early spawning season and 2 months after). We assessed the boldness, energy stores and reproductive effort of crabs collected across 10 oyster reefs of low and high quality using laboratory observations and subsequent dissections. Crab boldness was significantly dependent on the interaction between habitat quality and season. While crab behaviour remained relatively constant on healthy reefs, crabs on degraded reefs exhibited a nearly two-fold increase in boldness during the late spawning season, approximating the boldness of crabs on healthy reefs. This behavioural change corresponds to a seasonal shift in crab energy store content and is likely to represent a switch in the primary driving force of crab behaviour. During the early season, crab boldness was positively correlated with short-term stores, whereas later in the season, crab boldness was negatively correlated with long-term stores. Our results suggest that behaviour is driven by predation pressure and refuge availability during the early spawning season, but afterwards depends on replenishing energy stores used for reproduction. These findings support ecological theory and also provide new insight into the stability of behavioural drivers.

AB When males and females differ in their spatial ecology, selection is expected to promote sex differences in spatial abilities. Although this prediction applies to many species, few studies have looked at sex differences in spatial abilities outside mammals. Here, we addressed this hypothesis in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a polygynous fish in which males disperse more than females and inhabit more spatially complex environments. We compared the performance of male and female guppies in two spatial tasks to test whether males have been selected for enhanced spatial abilities. In a detour task (experiment 1), the two sexes showed similar ability to navigate around an obstacle to reach a target. However, males were more persistent in trying to pass through the transparent obstacle, an effect that is likely to be related to sex differences in cognitive flexibility rather than to spatial abilities. In the second experiment, with a more complex maze in which guppies had to choose between alternative routes to reach the target, males learned the task after only one presentation, whereas females did not show any evidence of learning after five trials. The direction of these differences is the same as that observed in most polygynous species investigated, suggesting a common pattern of cognitive sex differences across vertebrates.

AB The investigation of the function of a complex adaptation can benefit from multiple approaches. We used comparative study and physical simulation to re-examine the hypothesis that parental adaptations enable carrion beetles (Silphidae) to better compete with carrion microbes. The comparative study used two closely related species, Nicrophorus orbicollis and Ptomascopus morio, which differ markedly in their level of care. Reproductive performance was measured using carcasses aged on field soil for 0, 3, 6 or 9 days. As expected, N. orbicollis converted more carrion biomass to offspring biomass than did P. morio (27.8% versus 16.6% on fresh carcasses) and both species produced smaller broods on aged carcasses. There was a negative interaction, however, between the level of care and carcass age on reproductive performance; the parental care advantage exhibited by N. orbicollis was less on older carcasses than on fresh carcasses, and was negligible on the oldest (6- and 9-day) carcasses. Ptomascopus morio also demonstrated superior ability to regulate the size of offspring when using carcasses of various ages. In a second experiment, we simulated antimicrobial activity of Nicrophorus anal exudates. A 6-day pretreatment with an antibacterial, an antifungal, or a combination treatment did not result in larger broods relative to those on untreated 6-day carcasses. The results call into question the hypothesis that preparation of the carcass by Nicrophorus evolved primarily as an adaptation for preventing microbial deterioration of carrion. We suggest that selection to compete with microbes may be relaxed in carrion beetles that provide elaborate parental care. A small vertebrate carcass is a potential model system for applying the comparative method to ecological function. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A coordinated reciprocal exchange of acoustic signals (duetting) is common in arthropods relying on su bstrate-borne vibrational signalling. Communication between partners is under evolutionary pressures resulting from ecological and sexual selection and reciprocal effects arising from such dynamic interactions may influence the sender's and receiver's mating success. We investigated the influence of female reply duration on male mate-searching effort in the leafhopper Aphrodes makarovi in which the female reply is essential for successful location of the female. In a duet, the beginning of a female reply overlaps the end of the male call and males evaluate only the nonoverlapped duration of the female reply. In playback experiments we varied the duration of female replies within the natural range. The duration of a female reply was negatively correlated with the male calling effort. By increasing her reply duration a female may significantly reduce the male's direct and indirect costs associated with signalling and searching, thus, ultimately, affecting male reproductive success. Males showed high adaptability in signalling behaviour and when female replies were short, searching males shortened the last section of their advertisement calls. This strategy allows the nonoverlapped part of the female reply to be longer irrespective of its overall duration. Despite its deceptively simple form, vibrational duetting may entail more complex interactions than just temporal coordination. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ability to discriminate between different quantities has important ecological relevance for animals when engaging in behaviours such as forming groups, foraging or trying to avoid predators. Quantity discrimination has been shown in a diversity of human and nonhuman animal species. In angelfish this discrimination ability has been investigated using dichotomous choice tests when the numerically different stimulus groups (shoals) of conspecifics were fully visible to the test fish. Here, using a new procedure we investigated whether test fish were able to discriminate between the contrasting shoals using their memory. After a period of full visual access to the contrasted shoals on the two sides of their test tank, the test fish was required to make a choice while being able to see only a single member of the stimulus shoals on each side. With this cognitively more demanding procedure we tested discrimination between numerically large shoals (>= four fish per stimulus shoal). As in our previous studies, we found that angelfish consistently chose the larger of the two shoals when the shoals differed by a 2: 1 or higher ratio, but not those that differed by a 3: 2 or 4: 3 ratio. The results followed Weber's law in that performance became poorer as the ratio between the two stimulus shoals approached one. In addition, when we kept the absolute difference between the contrasted shoals constant, discrimination was less accurate as the shoal sizes increased. This pattern of results lends support for the analogue magnitude representational system in the angelfish, a nonverbal approximation system believed to be employed by a diversity of human and nonhuman animal species. Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that angelfish remember the different shoals presented to them, i.e. they make their choice based upon mental representation of the different quantities.

AB Studies of several mammalian species confirm that formant frequencies (vocal tract resonances) predict height and weight better than does fundamental frequency (F0, perceived as pitch) in same-sex adults due to differential anatomical constraints. However, our recent meta-analysis (Pisanski et al., 2014, Animal Behaviour, 95, 89-99) indicated that formants and F0 could explain no more than 10% and 2% of the variance in human height, respectively, controlling for sex and age. Here, we examined whether other voice parameters, many of which are affected by sex hormones, can indicate additional variance in human body size or shape, and whether these relationships differ between the sexes. Using a cross-cultural sample of 700 men and women, we examined relationships among 19 voice parameters (minimum-maximum F0, mean F0, F0 variability, formant-based vocal tract length estimates, shimmer, jitter, harmonics-to-noise ratio) and eight indices of body size or shape (height, weight, body mass index, hip, waist and chest circumferences, waist-to-hip ratio, chest-to-hip ratio). Our results confirm that formant measures explain the most variance in heights and weights of men and women, whereas shimmer, jitter and harmonics-to-noise ratio do not indicate height, weight or body mass index in either sex. In contrast, these perturbation and noise parameters, in addition to F0 range and variability, explained more variance in body shape than did formants or mean F0, particularly among men. Shimmer or jitter explained the most variance in men's hip circumferences (12%) and chest-to-hip ratios (6%), whereas harmonics-to-noise ratio and formants explained the most variance in women's waist-to-hip ratios (11%), and significantly more than in men's waist-to-hip ratios. Our study represents the most comprehensive analysis of vocal indicators of human body size to date and offers a foundation for future research examining the hormonal mechanisms of voice production in humans and perceptual playback experiments.

AB Colonial species breed in densely aggregated territories containing no resources other than nest sites. This behaviour is usually explained by natural selection, for instance through benefits resulting from reduced predation risk. An alternative hypothesis suggests that, as in lek breeding systems, sexual selection may be responsible for the aggregation of competitors, driven by an increased potential for female mate choice among closely assembled males. Lamprologus callipterus, a shell-brooding cichlid fish of Lake Tanganyika, provides an ideal test case for the utility of lek evolution models to explain colonial breeding, because breeding territories are established by males before pairing. Large males collect and defend empty snail shells that are then chosen by females for breeding. We checked for a potential influence of sexual selection on colonial breeding in L callipterus by testing predictions of the hot-shot and female preference hypotheses of lek mating models. In the field, we found that territories of larger males were more centrally located and that females preferred to breed with males surrounded by many neighbours, two findings that are consistent with lek mating models. Female preference suggests that sexual selection affects colonial breeding in L callipterus, which implies an influence of sexual selection on the evolution of colonial breeding at large.

AB Differentiation in the structure of animal signals and displays among closely related species has intrigued biologists for centuries. Such divergence is often attributed to behavioural premating isolation, where sexual selection has favoured species recognition in environments containing sympatric congeners. However, in some cases closely related taxa have undergone speciation and display differentiation in isolation, in the apparent absence of benefits afforded by species recognition. Such is the case for the lava lizards (Microlophus spp.) endemic to the Galapagos Islands, where no two species overlap in distribution and all are thought to have evolved in allopatry from congeners. To test alternative evolutionary models, we used several phylogenetic comparative methods to assess how Microlophus displays have evolved. Results showed some potential for the influence of genetic drift, but little evidence of sexual selection (via male-male competition) or colonization history on the way displays have diverged among taxa. We then used lizard robots to test whether two representative Galapagos lava lizard species, Microlophus grayii and Microlophus indefatigabilis, would respond preferentially to a robot performing conspecific displays over those of the congener. We predicted that, in the absence of reinforcing selection, neither species would show a preference for conspecific displays. Results were mixed: whereas M. grayii showed no discrimination of conspecific over heterospecific displays, male M. indefatigabilis showed significantly stronger responses to their own displays than to those of the heterospecific. We then conducted the same experiment with a mainland congener, Microlophus occipitalis, to provide a broader view of potential responses across the group. Results revealed significant discrimination against heterospecific displays. We discuss our findings in light of hypotheses of signal differentiation, and suggest alternative interpretations for recognition of conspecific displays in species that are thought to have evolved in isolation.

AB Eusocial insects often display a certain degree of task specialization, which may help maximize the efficiency of a colony. Here we tested for the presence of task specialization in a eusocial mammal. Naked mole-rats, Heterocephalus glaber, were videorecorded across multiple days in their home colony and in a neutral arena with an unfamiliar conspecific for determination of short-term behavioural profiles. They were also recorded in these settings across the birth of multiple litters to assess the stability of behaviour patterns over months. Pup care behaviour, working behaviour and colony defence were unevenly distributed among subordinate mole-rats. Furthermore, these behaviours were stable across days and months. Across days, age was positively related to colony defence and negatively related to pup carrying. We also tested whether behaviours were stable across contexts by observing pup care behaviour outside of the colony in a neutral arena. We further attempted to determine whether mole-rats' behaviours were contingent on the demands of the colony by removing the most frequent performers of pup care, colony defence and work behaviour from each colony. Results from these experiments suggest that when task specialists were no longer present, remaining animals adjusted their behaviour to fill the needs of the colony. Under these circumstances, younger animals engaged in the majority of working and pup-carrying behaviour while older animals engaged in the majority of colony defence behaviours. Thus, subordinate naked mole-rats show both task specialization and task switching. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The African lion, Panthera leo, is threatened throughout much of its remaining range by human impacts such as loss of prey, habitat fragmentation and direct human-caused mortality, often in response to livestock predation. Lions' ability to adjust their behaviour to reduce direct contact with humans may affect their survival. We used fine-scale GPS data to measure lions' response to humans at two scales: between land use types (commercial ranches versus pastoral lands) and with proximity to human-occupied locations (i.e. livestock enclosures: 'bomas') within commercial ranch land. Study lions on commercial ranches reacted to the location and activity levels of humans on the local scale, showing no overall spatial avoidance but fine-scale temporal partitioning in their use of areas in close proximity to bomas, being closest at times when human activity was lowest (i.e. between 2300 and 0500 hours). At the land use scale, however, lions showed significant (but not total) spatial avoidance of pastoral land, despite similar prey densities and habitat structure on both land use types, indicating that lions' ability to utilize pastoral land was limited by pastoral people. When lions did utilize pastoral land, they were more likely to do so during the dark hours, when people were confined to bomas, than during the daylight hours. Lions moved faster and straighter in pastoral lands and when close to bomas, indicating that they adjust 'how' they move in response to humans. They were found closer to bomas with increasing rainfall and decreasing moonlight. Overall, lion movements suggested an ability to partition their activities spatiotemporally with those of humans such that risk of human-caused mortality was minimized while use of a human-dominated landscape was maximized.

AB Decision making is a necessary process for most organisms, even for the majority of known life forms: those without a brain or neurons. The goal of this review is to highlight research dedicated to understanding complex decision making in non-neuronal organisms, and to suggest avenues for furthering this work. We review research demonstrating key aspects of complex decision making, in particular information integration and multiattribute decision making, in non-neuronal organisms when (1) utilizing adaptive search strategies when foraging, (2) choosing between resources and environmental conditions that have several contradictory attributes and necessitate a trade-off, and (3) incorporating social cues and environmental factors when living in a group or colony. We discuss potential similarities between decision making in non-neuronal organisms and other systems, such as insect colonies and the mammalian brain, and we suggest future avenues of research that use appropriate experimental design and that take advantage of emerging imaging technologies.

AB Many insect groups are important mutualistic partners of plants. Bees in particular provide an essential mutualistic service to plants: pollination of their flowers. They can also act as seed dispersers for plants, a rare seed dispersal mutualism termed melittochory. One group of known bee seed dispersers are stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini). Australian stingless bees collect resin from fruits of the eucalypt tree Corymbia torelliana (Myrtaceae). In doing so, they disperse the trees' seeds. Therefore, the resin chemistry of C. torelliana may be particularly well adapted to attract the bees. While the importance of visual and olfactory cues has been frequently studied in pollination mutualisms, we here provide the first study to investigate the importance of resin compounds as olfactory cues in a bee seed dispersal mutualism. To investigate whether the seed-dispersing Australian stingless bee species Tetragonula carbonaria relies on olfactory cues when searching for C. torelliana resin and which compounds of the blend they use to identify it, we performed several choice tests with pure resin extracts, fractionated extracts, extracts enriched with C. torelliana resin compounds and with single compounds. Olfactory cues were sufficient to attract bees, confirming the importance of olfactory cues for resin-searching stingless bees. However, bees only landed on filter papers with pure resin extract, but not on fractionated or enriched extracts, nor on single compounds. This finding indicates that, instead of relying on just a few specific volatile compounds, the bees used a complex blend as recognition cue including relative compound proportions.Moreover, they showed little tolerance for even slight concentration changes of single components. Such high cue specificity is rather unusual for insects seeking resources, but does, in the case of Australian stingless bees, ensure detection and identification of the resin of their mutualistic partner.

AB Animals frequently engage in mutual displays that may allow or at least help decisions about the outcome of agonistic encounters with mutual benefit to the opponents. In fish these often involve lateral displays, with previous studies finding evidence of population-level lateralization with a marked preference for showing the right side and using the right eye. Because both opponents tend to show this preference a head to tail configuration is formed and is used extensively during the display phase. Here we tested the significance of these lateral displays by comparing displays to a mirror with those to a real opponent behind a transparent barrier. The frequency of displays was lower to a mirror but the individual displays were of greater duration indicating a slower pace of the interaction with a mirror. This suggests that fish respond to initiatives of real opponents but as mirror images do not initiate moves the focal fish only moves when it is ready to change position. However, lateralization was still found with mirrors, indicating that the right-side bias is a feature of the individual and not of the interaction between opponents. We discuss implications for ideas about the evolution of mutual cooperation and information exchange in contests, as well as the utility of the use of mirrors in the study of aggression in fish.

AB Within a species, sharing of data about identity, sex, health and hormonal status or feeding resources confers an advantage for survival and is actively pursued by linking signalling molecules to specific behavioural or neurohormonal responses. The proper identification of the signals (morphology), their correct use (grammar) and their meaning (semantics) allow us to understand the link between signals and responses. In mice, Mus musculus, the identification of meaningful molecules has revealed that both small airborne molecules and custom-tailored proteins are involved in chemical signalling. Among them, the major urinary proteins (MUPs) are barrel-like lipocalins excreted in urine. They bind and transport volatile molecules that may have different meanings, yet MUPs participate in transmitting different pieces of information. Therefore, they are not a simple blend of molecules but a communication system with its own rules to produce, transmit and process information. These actions affect both the physiology and the behaviour of sender and receiver. In fact, functional, behavioural and anatomical specializations allow production and emission of chemosignals by the sender, and proper signal detection and response management by the receiver. Moreover, the response to chemosignals may vary in time, according to internal and external conditions. The mechanism of biological chemical signalling is so efficient and versatile that MUPs are now used as molecular traps to develop biomimetic chemical sensors.

AB Because of the powerful selective pressure for survival, neonatal mammals must rapidly locate and orally seize a nipple to gain the nutritional, energetic and protective advantages of milk. Thus, it is critical for females to facilitate the efforts of their offspring by presenting interface structures for milk transfer (the papilla mammae or nipple) that match the newborn receivers' psychology. Mammalian females have evolved nipples that exploit their neonates' most generally advanced sensory systems, viz. somesthesis and olfaction. Therefore, in addition to the production of odour cues derived from mammary and extramammary sources (saliva) and that reflect individual-specific conditions (diet, physiological stage, etc.), female nipples may have anatomical-physiological features that emit species-specific chemosignals. This mother-to-infant communication is briefly surveyed here based on studies in several species of lagomorphs, rodents and primates. In these species, the release of mammary chemostimuli ranging from individual-specific cues (i.e. arbitrary odorants) to species-specific signals (i.e. pheromones) is a general mechanism for eliciting neonatal arousal, motivation and attraction to the mother. Such chemostimuli provide guidance for localizing the nipple and elicit oral grasping of it. The behavioural activity of some of these chemostimuli does not appear to depend on learning, whereas others clearly depend on previous exposure and learning for their activity. In certain cases, unlearned mammary signals and arbitrary odour cues work in tandem, as the former can expedite the learning of the latter, which then take on a similar function to the unlearned signals. We review the degree of specialization of mammary semiochemical processes in mammalian mother-to-newborn communication from production and transmission by females to reception, integration and behaviour in newborns.

AB Workers in many eusocial insect species show a phenomenon sometimes referred to as 'elitism', in which a small proportion of individual workers engaged in a task perform a disproportionately large fraction of the work achieved by the colony as a whole. This phenomenon has not been well studied for foraging behaviour in honeybees (Apis mellifera) because detailed observational studies of foraging activity have been limited by the difficulty of successfully tracking large numbers of individual workers. Here, we used radio frequency identification technology to monitor honeybee flight behaviour automatically and generate lifetime flight activity records for large numbers of individuals from multiple colonies. We observed a consistent skew in activity levels of honeybee foragers, similar to that reported in many other social insects. However, this skew was a consequence of modulation of foraging activity by environmental and social factors rather than the existence of a distinct group or subcaste of elite foragers. Individual responses to experimental manipulation of the foraging workforce confirmed that activity level was flexibly adjusted according to colony needs. These results demonstrate that elitism in insect societies can arise as the extreme of a stable spectrum of individual behavioural activity that allows the colony to respond easily to unexpected needs rather than relying on responses of a rigidly defined subgroup of workers.

AB Males from gift-giving species attempt to obtain food to offer to females. Therefore, food access may affect both their body condition and their reproductive success. In some species, males reduce the costs associated with giving gifts by reusing gifts, or by offering inedible items. Males from the spider Paratrechalea ornata (Trechaleidae) offer fresh prey or 'genuine gifts' to females, but also offer prey leftovers or 'worthless gifts'. We examined gift weight and content, and their relation to male condition in the field. We also investigated how gift content, male condition and female reproductive status (virgin/mated) affect male mating success. In the field, most gifts were worthless; genuine gifts were heavier than worthless ones; and gift weights (both genuine and worthless gifts combined) were positively correlated with male condition. In the laboratory, males in good condition had higher mating success than males in poor condition. Males offering gifts (genuine or worthless) to virgin females enjoyed similar mating success and duration; neither differed significantly when compared to males without gift. In contrast, mated females behaved differently. Males without gifts were consistently rejected by mated females, while those that offered worthless gifts achieved matings. The interplay between male condition, prey access, female mating history and female preferences for gifts can favour the evolution of worthless gifts under certain conditions. Females do not penalize males with non-nutritive items by not mating or by reducing mating duration, but penalties may be potentially exerted via postcopulatory process.

AB Consistent, stable behavioural differences in how individuals respond to novel situations can lead to variation in exposure to pathogens. To minimize the costs associated with pathogen infection, animals have evolved behavioural and immunological strategies to avoid infection. However, because both behavioural and immunological defences are costly, host individuals should benefit from balancing investment in these defence strategies. It has been suggested that one such behavioural defence strategy is hesitancy to engage with novel objects and environments. In particular, exploratory individuals appear more likely to be exposed to novel pathogens than less exploratory individuals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that immune function is inversely related to behaviours with the potential to decrease exposure to pathogens (i.e. forgoing exploratory behaviours). We found an inverse association between aspects of innate immune function and exploratory behaviours. These observations suggest that individuals that engage in low-risk behaviours when experiencing a novel situation may invest less in some aspects of innate immune function than individuals that engage in high-risk behaviours. This individual variation in pathogen defence strategy is expected to affect the dynamics of pathogen spread through populations, and ultimately the course of epidemics.

AB Foraging innovations are increasingly recognized as an important source of phenotypic plasticity, evolutionary change and adaptation to environmental challenges. One line of research has successfully demonstrated that innovation can represent a stable individual trait, but by the same token has shown strong contextual effects on innovation. We examined the effects of social context on innovative foraging behaviour. Across two separate experiments, we measured the individual propensity of Indian mynahs, Acridotheres tristis, to innovate when alone, in pairs, or in groups of five birds. Although innovators remained consistent in their relative innovation performance ranking (high, medium, low), the presence of one or more conspecifics reduced the likelihood of innovating, and increased innovation latencies, significantly relative to when individuals were tested alone. A neophobia test in which latency to forage was compared in both the absence and the presence of a novel object, in each of two social contexts (solitary versus social), showed that the presence of conspecifics caused mynahs to forage significantly faster in a safe situation (object absent) relative to when alone, but to delay foraging in a risky situation (object present). Together, these findings suggest that sociality can have contrasting effects on foraging in safe and risky situations, and, in some species at least, effects of sociality on innovative foraging may hence be more akin to those observed in the presence of risk. Negotiation over engaging with risks inherent to innovative foraging offered the most likely explanation for socially inhibited innovation behaviour, and may act to constrain the diffusion of innovations under some conditions.

AB Although long neglected, female competition is widespread and may have stronger evolutionary consequences than previously thought. In singular breeders, reproductive success is conditional on social status, and intrasexual competition for the dominant position can be particularly severe in females. Because the ability of females to secure the dominant position may strongly influence their fitness, a better understanding of the determinants of dominance maintenance is needed. Using a 21-year data set on Alpine marmots, Marmota marmota, we investigated the potential drivers of female dominance loss in a singularly breeding mammal. Particularly, we tested whether the dominant females' ability to retain their social position depended on the number and the characteristics (age, relatedness to dominant individuals) of potential competitors in the social unit. To identify the potential underlying mechanism, we further investigated how the number of subordinate females affected females' competitive ability. We found that the risk of losing the dominant position increased with the number of subordinate adult females in the group, but that the age of the subordinate females and their parentage relationships to the dominant individuals were unlikely to be driving dominance loss in this species. Moreover, when the number of potential competitors in the social unit increased, we observed a difference in body mass increase between the dominant and her subordinates leading to a decrease in the body mass difference between dominant females and their subordinate adult females, and ultimately to a higher risk of females losing the dominant position. Overall, our results showed that the number of potential competitors in a social group affects the females' ability to secure their dominant position, and suggested that this effect is mediated through changes in female body mass.

AB Mating elicits dramatic changes in behaviour and physiology related to reproduction in female Drosophila melanogaster, but little is known about how mating affects nutrient intake and preferences in this model organism. Postmating switches in reproductive activity and feeding are likely to alter life span because both reproduction and nutrition are closely linked to survival. To explore these possibilities, we compared the intake patterns of protein (P) and carbohydrate (C) preferred by male, mated female and virgin female adults of D. melanogaster and their life span responses under varying dietary P:C balances (0:1, 1:1 and 4:1). Despite sex differences, the patterns of both macronutrient intake and life span were remarkably similar between males and virgin females. Compared to unmated virgins, mated females consumed ca. 2.7 times more nutrients and preferred a diet that was significantly more protein-rich (mated versus virgin females:P:C 1:1.5 versus 1:4). Surprisingly, females that had experienced mating in early adulthood lived longer than those that remained virgin, and this life span-extending effect of mating in females was most profound on a diet that was equally balanced (P:C 1:1). Our results indicate that mating is an important modulator that regulates sex-specific nutrient preference, which in turn alters longevity in D. melanogaster.

AB The use of social networks to describe animal social structure is increasing, yet our understanding of how social networks respond to changing ecological conditions remains limited. Animal behaviour is often constrained by temporal or spatial variation in ecological conditions; how do behaviour and social organization respond to changing ecological conditions? We used a social network approach to ask this question in the pair-living sleepy lizard, Tiliqua rugosa. We attached GPS data loggers to lizards to record their movement, activity and social interactions during their activity period (October-December) in 2008-2010. The years varied substantially in ecological conditions, from hot and dry in 2008 to cool and wet in 2010. Our aim was not to suggest how individual climatic or ecological factors influence social organization, but to explore the stability of social structure over varying conditions. Lizards spent less time active and overlapped in home range area more with conspecifics in the driest year of the study (2008) than in subsequent years. Despite this variation in behaviour, the number and strength of connections in the social network were stable across years. Intrasexual associations were similar across years, but there was a lower incidence of intersexual associations in 2008 than in the other 2 years. Among male-female dyads, pairing intensity was lower in 2008, while for males, extrapair strength was higher in 2008. These results suggest that although the overall social network is tolerant to changes in ecological conditions, the nature of contacts within the network shifts in response to ecological variation.

AB We previously demonstrated that domestic hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, show behavioural and physiological responses when witnessing mild chick distress, and possess the underlying foundations of emotional empathy. However, no studies have determined how cognitive influences affect empathic processes in birds. A fundamental question is whether a mother hen's response to chick distress is mediated by her knowledge about the situation or by chick distress cues. We therefore investigated how manipulating hen and chick knowledge influences hens' responses to chick distress. Each hen's brood of chicks was split into three groups, based on whether they had the same, opposite or no knowledge about a potentially threatening situation (environmental cues signalling air puff administration). We compared hens' behavioural, vocal and physiological responses (heart rate, heart rate variability and surface body temperature) to actual and perceived threat to their chicks. Hens increased maternal vocalizations and walking, and decreased preening, when they perceived their chicks to be threatened, regardless of the chicks' reactions to the situation. Hens exhibited signs of stress-induced hyperthermia only when their perception of threat was in accordance with that of their chicks. Chick behaviour was influenced by the hens' expectations, with all chick groups spending more time distress vocalizing and less time preening when in the environment that the hen associated with threat. We conclude that the protective maternal response of domestic hens is not solely driven by chick distress cues; rather, hens integrate these with their own knowledge to produce a potentially adaptive, flexible and context-dependent response.

AB The 'multitasking hypothesis' for complex signal function predicts performance trade-offs between signal components that negatively covary (e.g. due to energetic or mechanical constraints) and receiver preferences for more extreme values of the negatively covarying components that are difficult to produce simultaneously. We tested these two predictions in Cope's grey treefrogs, Hyla chrysoscelis. In a field study, we recorded and analysed 1000 advertisement calls from males calling in breeding choruses to test the prediction that two signal components important in female mating decisions (call rate and call duration) negatively covary under natural conditions. In a laboratory study, we conducted phonotaxis tests with female subjects to test the prediction that females prefer calls with higher overall 'call efforts' (the product of call rate x call duration). Consistent with predictions of the multitasking hypothesis, call rate and call duration were significantly negatively related and females preferred calls produced with higher call efforts, manifested through preferences for greater values of both call rate and call duration. We conducted an additional playback experiment to test the hypothesis that males increase their call effort in competitive situations to maximize their attractiveness to females. Compared to quiet conditions, male subjects increased their call duration and decreased their call rate, but did not alter call effort, in response to a simulated calling neighbour or broadcasts of chorus noise. Together our data have implications for understanding the function of multicomponent signals when signallers must balance performance trade-offs in mate attraction with dynamic signal modifications in other social contexts.

AB Same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) is attracting increasing research attention, but quantifying and interpreting SSB present unique challenges. Chief among these are (1) partitioning the expression of SSB into separate influences from interacting partners, (2) distinguishing between same-sex behaviour, same-sex preference and same-sex orientation and testing for correlations between them, and (3) evaluating how the social environment modulates the expression of SSB. We used sexually mature male Drosophila melanogaster in staged encounters to address these aims. The expression of SSB was not consistent across choice and no-choice experimental trials, indicating that a tendency to display SSB when females are absent does not correlate with greater same-sex preference when a choice is available. The expression of SSB was sensitive to the social experience of males. Experience with other males and experience with females both decreased the incidence of male SSB, suggesting that both avoidance learning and mating experience mitigate its expression. SSB in D. melanogaster appears to be a highly labile trait susceptible to varied influences from the social environment. We suggest that SSB expressed in different social contexts probably represents different physiological origins, which is a potentially important consideration in studies examining its genetic architecture and evolutionary maintenance.

AB Olfactory communication is widespread across the animal kingdom but until recently was believed to be unimportant in songbirds. However, recent studies of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, have found that fledglings are capable of recognizing their own nest based on olfactory cues alone. This raises the important question of whether this knowledge is learned or innate. To discriminate between these two hypotheses, we experimentally fostered single eggs into foreign, unrelated broods, and subsequently tested the odour preferences of the respective fledglings. In contrast to a previous study in which individuals were fostered as chicks, we found a strong preference for the host nest odour. This suggests that olfactory imprinting occurs and is based on a familial template learnt within a narrow time window around hatching. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Mate selection is one of the motors of evolution and of particular importance in the case of organisms in which sexual and parthenogenetic populations coexist. Sexual populations of the ostracod species complex Eucypris virens are often mixed with parthenogenetic ones. A powerful mate selection mechanism must exist to avoid time, energy and sperm loss, for the maintenance and success of sexual reproduction in these mixed populations. There are four types of E. virens individuals: males (diploid), sexual females (diploid) and asexual females (parthenogenetic and either di- or triploid). From one parthenogenetic population and two populations with males of E. virens, we sampled early stage juveniles, and reared them to adulthood in isolation. We combined three virgin ostracods, one male and two females, these latter of contrasting reproductive mode (sexual versus asexual) and origin (allopatric versus sympatric to the males). A posteriori molecular analyses further allowed identification of the mitochondrial clade and ploidy level of the individuals. Strong mate preferences were detected: sexual encounters occurred almost exclusively between males and sexual females and those involving asexual females (either di- or triploid) occurred rarely. The clear recognition of sexual individuals among each other implies that the presence of parthenogens does not greatly disturb the reproductive process in the sexual population. Moreover, this behaviour might play a role in the emergence and cohesiveness of cryptic species within E. virens. Although rare in small populations and at short timescales, copulations between males and asexual females support the hypothesis of hybrid origin for polyploidy.

AB Innovative problem solving enables individuals to deal with novel social and ecological challenges. However, our understanding of the importance of innovation for animals in their natural habitat is limited because experimental investigations of innovation have historically focused on captive animals. To determine how captivity affects innovation, and whether captive studies of animal innovation suffer from low external validity, we need experimental investigations of innovation in both wild and captive populations of the same species in diverse taxa. Here we inquired whether wild and captive spotted hyaenas differ in their ability to solve the same novel technical problem, and in the diversity of exploratory behaviours they exhibit when first interacting with the problem. Our results suggest that wild and captive populations show important differences in their innovative problem-solving abilities. Captive hyaenas were significantly more successful at solving the novel problem, and significantly more diverse in their initial exploratory behaviour, than were wild hyaenas. We were able to rule out hypotheses suggesting that these differences result from excess energy or time available to captive animals. We conclude that captive hyaenas were more successful because captive individuals were less neophobic and more exploratory than their wild counterparts. These results have important implications for our interpretation of studies on innovative problem solving in captive animals and aid our attempts to gain a broader understanding of the importance of innovation for animals in their natural habitat.

   sparrow; song learning; vocal performance

AB Cultural evolution can result in changes in the prevalence not only of different learned song types within bird populations but also of different segments within the song. Between 1980 and 2011, we examined changes within different segments of the single songs of male Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichiensis, in an island population. Introductory notes did not change. The buzz segment showed similar stability; although a rare low-frequency variant appeared and then disappeared, the buzz segments from 1980 and 2011 were essentially identical. The middle segment, made up of discrete notes assembled into several types, was variable. However, the form of the middle segment did not affect fitness and may serve to denote individual identity. The terminal trill decreased steadily in frequency and duration over three decades. Longer trills were associated with lower reproductive success, suggesting that trill duration was under sexual selection. The notes sung between introductory notes were also associated with reproductive success. A high cluster sung in 1980-1982 disappeared altogether by 2011, and was gradually replaced by click trains, which were associated with greater reproductive success. During the final decade of the study, more clicks were added to click trains. Longer click trains, which may require vocal virtuosity and so indicate male quality, were also associated with greater reproductive success. Both trill duration and the number of clicks increased in variance during the three-decade span of the study. We suggest that such increases in variance might be a signature of directional cultural selection. Within the Savannah sparrow's relatively short and simple learned song, cultural evolution appears to be mediated by different mechanisms for different song segments, perhaps because the segments convey different information.

AB Many nestling birds go silent in response to parental alarm calls, potentially lowering their risk of being overheard by predators. Parents are not always nearby, however, and so offspring could also benefit if they respond to the alarm calls of other species. Response could be innate, particularly if heterospecific alarm calls are acoustically similar to conspecific alarms, or learned through experience or association with parental behaviour. We investigated the responses of both young (5-6 days old) and older (10-11 days old, close to fledging) nestling white-browed scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis, to the mobbing alarm calls of three heterospecifics whose nests are vulnerable to similar predators. Brown thornbills, Acanthiza pusilla, produce the most similar alarm calls to scrubwrens, while superb fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus, and New Holland honeyeater, Phylidonyris novaehollandiae, produce alarm calls that are distinct. Heterospecific mobbing assays demonstrated that nestlings were likely to overhear the alarm calls of all three species. In support of innate response, even young nestlings suppressed calling after hearing both thornbill and parental alarms. However, young nestlings ignored or increased calling to fairy-wren and honeyeater alarms. Older nestlings continued to suppress calling to thornbill and parental alarm calls, but also suppressed calling to honeyeater and fairy-wren alarms, suggesting that they could have learnt to recognize those calls. This study thus demonstrates that nestlings can respond to the alarm calls of other species, and that these responses are likely to be enabled through both innate mechanisms and learning.

AB A variety of adaptive and nonadaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the maintenance of same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) in animals. Adaptive hypotheses have gained limited support in insect systems, and the behavioural mechanisms underlying the expression of SSB are not well understood. A frequently suggested mechanism is that SSB in insects occurs as a result of mistaken identity. We used the field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus, to evaluate adaptive hypotheses for the existence of male SSB and then dissect its proximate behavioural origins. We tested whether male SSB mitigates the costs of intrasexual aggression or facilitates the establishment of social dominance. We found no support for either of these adaptive hypotheses. However, the social environment males experienced modulated their expression of SSB. Males with recent experience of females in their social environment were between three and eight times more likely to engage in SSB in subsequent encounters with males, compared to males that experienced either another male or no social contact. Our results provide evidence that male SSB in T. oceanicus arises as a result of mistaken identity driven by weakened sex discrimination when there is a perception of females available for mating, and they highlight a pivotal role for behavioural plasticity in the expression of SSB.

The greater sac-winged bat, Saccopteryx bilineata, lives in a harem-based resource defence polygyny with patrilineal kin groups and female-biased natal dispersal. Pups of both sexes produce isolation calls to elicit maternal care. We analysed isolation calls from 25 pups born in seven different social groups in search of vocal signatures. In addition to a constant individual signature, isolation calls exhibited a group signature that became more prominent during ontogeny. Call convergence of fellow pups was independent of relatedness among pups and not driven by maturation effects, showing that the group signature was acquired through social modification, a form of vocal production learning. Behavioural observations of free-living bats indicated that isolation calls were used by adult males to appease more dominant males and to court unfamiliar females. The learned group signature in isolation calls may function as a 'password' that reliably associates individuals with their natal colony. This, in turn, could facilitate male harem acquisition and female inbreeding avoidance in the polygynous S. bilineata. The flexibility inherent in the vocal-learning process guarantees that crucial information can be promoted even under shifting social circumstances.

AB Individuals often show consistent differences in behavioural traits that may belong to a behavioural syndrome. Aggressive propensity is usually an important component of consistent behavioural types, potentially generating benefits in resource competition with conspecifics that may be traded off against costs in other contexts (e.g. acquisition of mates or coexistence with group members). Such trade-offs have not yet been studied in highly social species. We investigated how aggressive propensity influences competition for dominance, shelters and mates in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Following an established protocol we compared growth trajectories of groups of four fish either matched or unmatched for aggressive type. Furthermore, we analysed social interactions, the acquisition of shelter and possible mating partners (by proximity to shelters and prospective mates) according to aggressive type, showing either high or low aggression levels. Contrary to prediction we found that differences in behavioural idiosyncrasies affected the likelihood of obtaining the dominant position and high-quality territories only marginally. Social interactions, growth rates and body reserve accumulation were affected by behavioural differences. However, the patterns observed in this experiment differed from previous studies and suggest a modulating effect of the social environment on the link between behavioural types and life history decisions. Hence, we suggest that in future studies this relationship should be thoroughly investigated under varying social contexts, especially in highly social species.

AB Mixed paternity or the presence of offspring sired by more than one male in a brood is common in birds. The hypothesis that mixed paternity should be low when male involvement in care is high has received widespread support in among-species comparisons that report a negative relationship between the percentage of mixed paternity and the extent of male parental care. These analyses have not incorporated data from Palaeognathes, a group where male only care is widespread. Understanding patterns of paternity in this group allows us to test assumptions about the predicted relationship between paternity and male-only care. I studied paternity of great tinamou, Tinamus major, and found high levels of mixed paternity in their nests (60% of nests and 24% of chicks). The incidence of mixed paternity was higher in larger clutches laid by multiple females than in smaller clutches laid by a single female. However, males that acquired larger clutches sired more offspring overall. Mixed paternity in this group is most likely the result of sequential mating by females. Together with previous findings in other Palaeognathes, these results show that high levels of mixed paternity and male parental care coexist in birds, while paternity assurance is not required for male parental care to be maintained, because males can increase their reproductive success by mating with multiple females, by siring offspring in other males' nests and by reducing predation risk to their offspring in larger clutches. Under these conditions male parental care can evolve despite the likelihood of mixed paternity. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The majority of studies investigating conflict management in animal societies have focused on the role of reconciliation in mediating the costs of aggression. The function of bystander affiliation (i.e. the selective attraction between an opponent and a bystander in the minutes immediately following aggression) is less well understood. We examined, in wild Barbary macaques, four potential functions of bystander affiliation with the victim of aggression: (1) bystander-initiated affiliation to reduce the victim's post-conflict (PC) anxiety (i.e. 'consolation'), (2) victim-initiated affiliation (i.e. 'solicited consolation'), (3) victim-and bystander-initiated affiliation to avert redirected aggression (i.e. self-protection), and (4) bystander-initiated affiliation to exploit grooming from the victim. We found partial support for the consolation function as bystander-initiated affiliation occurred more frequently between high-quality social partners but had no effect on the victim's PC anxiety. In support of the solicited-consolation function, victim-initiated affiliation occurred more frequently between high-quality social partners and also caused a reduction in the victim's PC anxiety. These findings suggest that solicited consolation may substitute for the stress alleviation role of reconciliation. We found no support for a self-protective function as neither the bystander's nor the victim's risk of receiving PC aggression was reduced following bystander affiliation with the victim. Finally, bystanders received significantly more PC grooming than victims, suggesting that grooming exploitation of the victim may drive the bystander's PC behaviour. Our results indicate that bystander affiliation has different functions and benefits for the victim of aggression and the bystander, and highlights the importance of considering which individual initiates this behaviour.

AB Honeybees, Apis mellifera, can differ considerably in their birth weights but the consequences of these weight differences for behaviour are unknown. I investigated how these birth weight differences affected their cognitive skills when the bees reached foraging age. Individual sucrose responsiveness measured by the proboscis extension response is a strong determinant of appetitive olfactory learning performance in honeybees. Most of the observed learning differences between individuals or between genetic bee strains correlate with differences in their sucrose responsiveness. My second aim was therefore to investigate whether the sucrose responsiveness of newly emerged bees could predict the learning behaviour of the bees 3 weeks later. Both birth weight and sucrose responsiveness measured at emergence could predict olfactory learning scores as demonstrated by significant positive correlations. Heavy bees and bees with high sucrose responsiveness later learned better than lighter individuals or bees with lower responsiveness to sucrose at emergence. These results demonstrate for the first time a fundamental relationship between sensory responsiveness and morphology at emergence and later cognitive skills in insects. Because sensory responsiveness is closely linked to division of labour in honeybees, differences in weight and sucrose responsiveness at emergence might be involved in regulating division of labour.

   OBSERVATIONS; SPRING MIGRATION; FLIGHT
AB Migratory birds are predicted to adapt their departure to wind, changing their threshold of departure and selectivity of the most favourable winds in relation to the mean, scatter and skewness of the wind regime. The optimal departure behaviour depends also on the importance of time and energy minimization during migration and on the ratio of cost of flight to cost of resting and waiting for more favourable winds. We compared departure and flight activity of shorebirds migrating in contrasting wind regimes during autumn (high probability of wind resistance) and spring (high probability of wind assistance) in southern Scandinavia, using data obtained by radiotelemetry, radar tracking and visual observations. The shorebirds changed their threshold for departure in relation to wind between the two seasons, flying almost exclusively with wind assistance in spring but regularly with wind resistance during autumn. The degree of wind selectivity in relation to the distributions of available wind effects was similar during autumn and spring indicating that reducing time and energy costs for migration was important during both seasons. These results demonstrate that migratory birds change departure behaviour in relation to the prevailing wind regime. It remains unknown whether they change behaviour not only seasonally but also in different zones along the migration route and whether they respond to differences not only in mean wind conditions but also in scatter and skewness between wind regimes. Our study indicates the possible existence of an adaptive flexibility in responses to wind regimes among migratory birds. (c) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many monogamous animals engage in a period of pair bonding prior to their ultimate mate choice (reproduction). One hypothesis about the function of this behaviour is that it allows individuals to continuously assess the quality of their partner as well as other potential mates. I tested this hypothesis in the convict cichlid, Amatitlania nigrofasciata, by providing males and females with a choice between their partner and a novel individual of the opposite sex at various time points after formation of a pair bond. Sex differences were observed in patterns of behaviour, with females significantly more likely to spend time with their partner than with another male, while males generally spent more time with a novel female than with their partner. The time spent in a pair bond affected this pattern, however, with both sexes showing a decreased time-based partner preference as the time in a pair bond increased. After forming a pair bond, males were largely aggressive towards novel females, treating them as territorial intruders, while pair-bonded females generally ignored novel males. Neither sex appeared to actively court potential mates apart from their partner. In a second experiment, I attempted to alter this pattern by presenting pair-bonded individuals with novel potential mates of relatively higher quality (larger size) than their partner. When given a 'better option', neither females nor males showed a preference for their partner over a large novel mate. All males continued to treat novel females as territorial intruders, while a subset of females shifted their preference from their partner to a larger novel male. These results support the hypothesis that the role of pair bonding may differ between the sexes in this species, functioning as a prolonged period of mate assessment in females, but not in males.

AB Chemosensory discrimination of sex and other individual traits based on pheromones occurs in many reptiles. However, the use of chemoreception in turtle social behaviour is poorly known. We examined the role of chemical signals in intraspecific communication of Spanish terrapins, Mauremys leprosa, during the breeding season. Chemical cues released by terrapins in the water might inform on sex and other individual characteristics, such as size, body condition or health state, which are important in sexual selection processes. To test this hypothesis, we compared the time spent by turtles in water pools containing chemical stimuli obtained from different conspecifics. Behavioural responses showed that turtles were able to detect and discriminate chemical cues released by conspecifics, and to modify their use of space in response to these cues alone. Males preferred water pools with chemicals of females with greater immune responses, while females preferred water pools with odours of larger males. Preferences for water used by better potential partners could increase mating opportunities with these partners, which would increase offspring fitness. Female preference for large males could also be a mechanism of protection from harassment by small males. On the other hand, males avoided water pools with chemicals of heavier, or relatively heavier, males and preferred water with chemicals of smaller, or relatively smaller, males. Chemosensory assessment of body size may allow males to minimize the risk of costly aggressive interactions with other males. Selection of water pools based on chemical cues of conspecifics may allow terrapins to optimize their mate searching while avoiding competitors.

AB A social lifestyle is often assumed to be more complex than a solitary one, due to social demands that may require increased cognitive capabilities. These nested assumptions underlie hypotheses to explain a correlation between brain size and group size in social vertebrates, using group size and accumulation of social traits, as alternative proxies for social complexity. Eusocial insects challenge the generality of the hypothesis that social complexity relies on increased cognitive capabilities of individuals. We used data from previously published studies to test for an association between sociality and brain size across 18 species (nine genera) of fungus-growing ants (Attini), which range from basal taxa with fewer than 100 monomorphic individuals, to derived colonies containing several million polymorphic, highly specialized individuals. Among monomorphic species, increased colony size was associated with decreased relative brain size and increased olfactory lobe size, although the latter result was sensitive to both the exclusion of potential outliers and whether phylogenetically independent contrasts were used. Within leafcutters (Atta), the relative size of the antennal lobes was also associated with group size, but may also reflect ecological foraging specialization, which may be a confounding variable. Comparisons between class-and individual-based societies highlight the general problem of increasing social structure in proportion to group size and show that there are alternative solutions to this problem: one alternative involves increasing behavioural specialization of individuals and evolved rules; the other involves increased diversification of individual behaviour, social norms and ultimately institutions.

AB Social competence is defined as the ability of an animal to optimize the expression of social behaviour as a function of the available social information. The social environment encountered early in life can affect the expression of various social behaviours later in life. We investigated whether early social experience can affect social competence. In the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher, we tested whether individuals reared with older brood-caring conspecifics persistently perform better in a series of tasks (1) simulating different social contexts, (2) assigning individuals different social roles and (3) exposing them to an unknown social situation. Fish that had been reared together with older conspecifics showed more appropriate behaviours both as winners (more aggressive displays) and as losers (more submissive displays) when aggressively competing with peers over a resource, and when trying to be accepted as subordinate group member and prospective brood care helper by an unfamiliar dominant pair (more submissive displays near shelters), a situation they had never encountered before. In both tasks fish that had grown up with older fish were tolerated better by conspecifics than fish reared with same-age siblings only. We detected effects of the early environment on social behaviour in the juvenile and adult stages of the test fish. Our results suggest that growing up in more complex social groups fosters a general social ability (i.e. social competence) in N. pulcher that improves their performance across different social roles and contexts, and which may provide fitness benefits.

AB When two social groups of the same species confront each other, what factors influence whether individuals participate in the struggle for defence of their group and its resources? In white-faced capuchin monkeys, Cebus capucinus, adult males play an important role in the outcome of intergroup encounters by cooperating aggressively against their opponents. However, not all male capuchin monkeys consistently participate in intergroup aggression. Our study therefore aimed to determine which elements influence the participation of males in a dispute. Playback experiments simulating intergroup encounters, which tested adult males in various social contexts, highlight the importance of the presence of another individual. Male white-faced capuchins, C. capucinus, participated in intergroup encounters more frequently when tested in the presence of another adult male than when tested alone. Male subjects were more likely to respond aggressively to the playback stimulus if the other individual present also responded aggressively. However, the number of males residing in the subject's group, relative to the number of males in the group from which the playback stimulus was recorded, did not seem to affect a male's response.

AB Studies of mating preferences contribute to understanding the evolution of male secondary sexual traits. How females respond to novel male characteristics may lend additional insight into their mating preferences and subsequent mate choice patterns. Studies on several species have shown that females prefer males with manipulated or novel phenotypes. However, few studies have investigated the mechanisms that underlie female preferences. Adopting a relatively underutilized technology in studies of mate choice (genetic modification), we used transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) to evaluate female preference for normal versus novel transgenic (red GloFish (TM)) males. We conducted four mate choice experiments in which females differed in rearing history to determine whether female mating preferences are influenced by population history, sexual imprinting or colour of food in their diet. We used a two-male association protocol in all four experiments as well as a one - male mating protocol in one experiment. In all four experiments, the association protocol demonstrated that females preferred novel transgenic males to normal males. The one-male protocol revealed no pattern of female mating preference; instead, mating patterns were strongly influenced by male coercion. Overall, our results suggest that zebrafish may possess a sensory bias for the colour red; however, more research using both closely related species and other colour morphs of GloFish (TM) are needed to resolve this issue. Our study exemplifies the utility of using transgenic organisms to study mate choice, and we propose that future studies incorporate this untapped technology.

AB The social organization of foraging processes is a principal key to the ecological success of eusocial insects. Floral odours brought back to the colony by successful foragers are important sources of information underlying an individual's decision about which resource to collect. Food-source-naive individuals memorize and use this olfactory information when searching for food in the field. Odour familiarization as mechanism underlying the coordination of foraging processes has received little attention so far. Here, we asked whether and to what extent foraging decisions of stingless bees, Melipona scutellaris, are influenced by preceding unrewarded olfactory experiences. In a classical conditioning assay (proboscis extension reflex, PER, assay), foragers were exposed to a scented airflow, during which they either received (experimental group CS+) or did not receive (experimental group CS-) a sugar solution as reward. Subsequently, bees of both experimental groups were introduced into an arena where they could choose between two scented feeders, one of which carried the odour used during the PER assay. Independently of whether foragers had received a sucrose reward during scent exposure, between 70% and 75% of the individuals chose the food source that carried the conditioned odour in the choice arena. Bees from the control groups (harnessed or not; no scent exposure), by contrast, showed no preference for either of the two feeders. These findings point to the importance of preceding olfactory experiences for the food choice of M. scutellaris and suggest that both associative learning during trophallaxis as well as familiarization may influence to a similar extent the foraging decisions of these bees in natural settings.

AB In many socially monogamous species, females copulate with and produce offspring sired by males other than their social mates, yet it remains controversial whether or how females benefit from these 'extrapair' copulations. Recently, it has been suggested that females might benefit if they are able to copulate with extrapair males that are genetically dissimilar to themselves, thereby potentially increasing the heterozygosity and/or reducing the level of inbreeding of the resulting offspring. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis have been criticized because a low number of molecular markers can lead to biased estimates of relatedness among individuals, and because all studies to date have been correlational and therefore unable to rule out potentially confounding factors. The red-backed fairy-wren is a bird with very limited dispersal, and hence the risks of inbreeding are high. We used a panel of microsatellite markers to examine paternity and relatedness between mates in this species, and also conducted an experiment that manipulated relatedness between a female and her social mate. Results from both approaches showed that females paired to genetically similar males were more likely to produce young sired by extrapair males, and that those offspring were less inbred (more heterozygous) than within-pair offspring. Thus, female fairy-wrens are able to avoid the potential costs of close inbreeding through extrapair copulations. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Scorpions are largely solitary, nocturnal arachnids that glow a bright cyan-green under UV light. The function of this fluorescence is a mystery. Previous studies of four species from three families have shown that scorpion lateral and medial eyes are maximally sensitive to green light (around 500 nm) and secondarily to UV (350-400 nm). Scorpions are negatively phototactic, and we used this behaviour to assay the responses of desert grassland scorpions, Paruroctonus utahensis, to 395 nm UV light, 505 nm cyan-green light, 565 nm green light and no light within small, circular arenas. Based on the eye sensitivity data, we predicted maximal response to 505 nm, followed by lower responses to 395 and 565 nm. In our experiments, however, scorpions responded most intensely (abrupt bouts of locomotory activity) to 395 nm and 505 nm. Next, we ran trials under 395 and 505 nm on scorpions with their eyes blocked. Scorpions with blocked eyes were much less likely to move under 505 nm than under 395 nm and were much less likely to move under 505 nm than were control animals (those without their eyes blocked). These results suggest an active role for fluorescence in scorpion light detection. Other studies indicate that photosensitive elements in scorpion tails are sensitive to green light. We therefore propose that the cuticle may function as a whole-body photon collector, transducing UV light to cyan-green before relaying this information to the central nervous system. Scorpions may use this information to detect shelter, as blocking any part of the cuticle could diminish the signal. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In many primate species, bipedal stance is a factor increasing manual laterality. To understand this phenomenon better, there is a need to investigate forelimb preferences in nonprimate mammals with bipedal locomotion as the preferred gait, such as bipedal hopping marsupials. We studied laterality in forelimb use in 27 adult red-necked wallabies during their usual daily activity in five zoos. During feeding from the bipedal position adult wallabies displayed group-level left-forelimb preference with the majority of individuals being lateralized. However, no lateralization was found at the group level during feeding from the quadrupedal position, with only a few animals expressing individual preferences. Wallabies showed significant group-level bias while using the right forelimb for supporting the body in the tripedal stance, with nearly half the individuals being lateralized. On a smaller sample of nine wallabies forelimb preferences in unimanual snout autogrooming were studied: seven individuals preferred to use their left forelimb and two displayed no preference. Additionally, we studied asymmetrical limb use during milk suckling in six young-at-foot wallabies. Here, all subjects more often pulled down the mother's pouch edge with the left forelimb and simultaneously supported the body with the right paw. Our results show that marsupials can display motor laterality at both individual and group levels, comparable with those observed in placentals. Moreover, in red-necked wallabies, much as in primates, the bipedal posture favours the expression of manual laterality, while its direction depends on the functional nature of the motor action. Evolutionary scenarios such as the postural origin theory of behavioural lateralization are discussed. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID RATTUS-NORVEGICUS; TYPICAL PATTERNS; SENSORIMOTOR; RESPONSES
AB Many types of animal behaviour, especially seemingly complex social interactions, have been attributed to the existence of complex cognitive mechanisms. Indeed, as specific behaviours are analysed in greater and greater detail, the increasing number of minor variations observed seem to necessitate the operation of increasingly powerful computational devices. An alternate view, inspired by cybernetic theory, is that what is important is not the specific behaviours used by animals, but the goal of the organism in a particular context. When approached in this way, it is possible to deduce simple rules being used by organisms to attain goal states that account for behavioural variation, and importantly, that do not require impossible levels of cognitive power. In this paper, we apply a cybernetic approach to analysing food protective behaviour in rats. We demonstrate that a simple cybernetic rule, rather than complex computation, produces efficient and effective food protective behaviour in rats.

AB Theory predicts that males that provide little or no parental investment can increase their reproductive success by fertilizing as many females as possible. By contrast, low male mating rate is often related to a large investment in a single mating. This view is challenged, however, by the occurrence of species in which males achieve only one or a few matings, yet invest little in mate guarding or paternity assurance. An explanation of this requires knowledge of the ecological factors affecting the mating system. When there is a female-biased sex ratio and a low probability of a female mating with additional males, the benefits of paternity protection are reduced. Under these conditions males are expected to search actively for females and invest little in each mating to maximize their mating rate. We investigated the influence of the sex ratio and male mortality on the male mate search strategy of the desert spider Stegodyphus lineatus (Eresidae), by following marked males in their natural habitat over the entire mating season. Males searching for mates suffered high mortality but encountered multiple females. During the mating season the sex ratio was highly female biased and females mated on average with a single male in their lifetime. We conclude that high costs of male mate search together with a female-biased sex ratio reduce the likelihood of multiple mating per female and the chances of male-male competition. Under these conditions males should invest in searching for more females and increasing their encounter rate. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ability to recognize predators is one of the most important lines of defence in a prey's arsenal, but the detection of novel predators poses a particular challenge. Novel predators provide few or no visual cues to inexperienced prey, which may have to rely on complementary chemical mechanisms to identify predators and survive the first encounters. We examined the role of diet-released chemical cues in facilitating predator recognition and promoting antipredator responses in predator-naive juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, presented with blank water or with diet cues from a common sympatric predator (the Eurasian otter, Lutra lutra) fed either salmon or a nonsalmon diet. No antipredator behaviour was found among individuals tested with blank water or with water scented with cues from an otter fed on a nonsalmon diet, suggesting that Atlantic salmon do not innately recognize the sympatric predator as a threat. In contrast, strong spatial avoidance, reduced activity and increasing ventilation were observed among salmon tested with water scented with cues from an otter fed on a salmon diet. We propose that juvenile salmon use diet-released conspecific alarm cues, and not predator-specific kairomones, to label novel predators as a threat chemically, thereby achieving generalized predator recognition and avoiding sensory overload.

AB Vocalizations used in aggressive and mating contexts often convey reliable information about signaller condition when physical or physiological limitations constrain signal expression. In vertebrates, androgens modulate the expression of vocal signals and provide a proximate link between male condition and signal form. In many songbirds, assessment of males is based on production of trills that are constrained by a performance trade-off between how fast notes are repeated and the frequency bandwidth of each note. In this study, we first recorded trills of male Neotropical singing mice (Scotinomys) to examine whether they show a similar performance trade-off, and then manipulated androgen levels to assess their role in modulating vocal performance. Lastly, we broadcast experimentally manipulated trills to females to determine whether they preferred versions resembling those of androgen-treated males. Singing mice showed a vocal performance trade-off similar to that of birds. Males treated with androgens maintained vocal performance, but castrated mice that were administered empty implants produced trills with lower performance. Females approached high-performance trills more rapidly and spent more time near corresponding speakers. Together, our results demonstrate that androgens modulate the production of physically challenging vocalizations, and the resulting signal variation influences female receiver response.

AB Parental care is a common strategy among vertebrates to ensure successful reproduction. Anuran amphibians have evolved a remarkable diversity of reproductive methods including advanced levels of parental care. Among the most derived strategies are those of the Neotropical poison frogs (Dendrobatidae). These amphibians exhibit a wide array of behavioural traits such as egg guarding, larval transport by parental frogs and larval feeding with trophic (unfertilized) eggs. Ranitomeya variabilis from the upper Amazon basin in Peru deposits both eggs and tadpoles in phytotelmata. The exploitation of these small pools is advantageous as it lowers the risk of predation, but it is more costly because of limited resource availability. Additionally, poison frog larvae are often cannibalistic, so the identification and avoidance of conspecifics represents an adaptive behaviour for these amphibians. While studies have shown that poison frogs actively avoid depositing with conspecifics, the mechanism for assessing pool quality remains unknown. In field experiments, we found that parental R. variabilis frogs used chemical cues to recognize the presence of tadpoles in phytotelmata. Furthermore, they distinguished between cannibalistic and noncannibalistic tadpoles, a behaviour that supports the survival of their own offspring.

AB Social insect foragers often have access to both social and private information about the locations of food sources. In honeybees, Apis mellifera, foragers can follow waggle dances (social information) to obtain vector information about the location of profitable food sources or they can use route memories (private information) acquired during previous foraging trips. The relative use of social information versus private information is poorly understood and currently debated. It is hypothesized that social information should be prioritized when the use of private information has a low benefit. We tested this hypothesis by training foragers to a high-quality 2 M sucrose feeder, which subsequently became unrewarding. As foragers continued to experience zero reward from their private route information they increased the time spent following waggle dances advertising an alternative food source with the same odour. A significant proportion of foragers successfully switched to the food source indicated by dances. Overall, trained foragers showed a strong attachment to the known but currently unrewarding feeder, even after repeatedly following dances advertising a profitable alternative. Successful recruits to the novel food source advertised by the waggle dances had more social information about this source in that they had followed dances for longer.

AB How individuals respond to predation threats will have a large influence on which individuals survive within a population. The magnitude and timing of these responses will be particularly important during periods of high predation susceptibility, such as that experienced by coral reef fishes immediately following settlement to the reef environment. Although reef fish are known to adopt certain antipredator behaviours when exposed to chemical alarm scents during this early period, the role of visual cues, and how the response varies with different levels of predation threat ( both olfactory and visual), remains unknown. This study examined the behavioural response of a newly settled coral reef fish (Pomacentrus amboinensis) to different levels of an olfactory and visual predation threat. The concentration of a conspecific chemical alarm cue and the visual proximity to a potential predator (Pseudochromis fuscus) were manipulated in separate aquarium experiments. Behavioural responses were found to be threat sensitive in nature, with higher-level threat cues eliciting a more intense response. Although significant changes were observed, responses to visual cues were more inconsistent, while responses to extremely low chemical cue concentrations were marginal, indicating a possible threshold lower limit. These findings demonstrate the ability of newly settled fish to assess the level of predation risk using both visual and chemical cues, and respond appropriately. 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Understanding cooperation between unrelated individuals remains a central problem in animal behaviour; evolutionary mechanisms are debated, and the importance of reciprocity has been questioned. Biological market theory makes specific predictions about the occurrence of reciprocity in social groups; applied to the social grooming of mammals, it predicts reciprocity in the absence of other benefits for which grooming can be exchanged. Considerable effort has been made to test this grooming trade model in nonhuman primates; such studies show mixed results, but may be confounded by kin effects. We examined patterns of reciprocity within and across bouts, and tested predictions of the grooming trade model, among wild male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes: a system with negligible kin effects. In accord with the model's expectations, we found that some grooming was directed by lower-to higher-ranked individuals, and that, on average, higher-ranked individuals groomed more reciprocally. We found no support, however, for a prediction that more reciprocity should occur between individuals close in rank. For most dyads, reciprocity of effort occurred through unbalanced participation in grooming bouts, but reciprocity varied considerably between dyads and only a small proportion showed strongly reciprocal grooming. Despite this, each male had at least one reciprocal grooming relationship. In bouts where both individuals groomed, effort was matched through mutual grooming, not alternating roles. Our results provide mixed support for the current grooming trade, biological market model, and suggest that it needs to incorporate risks of currency inflation and cheating for species where reciprocity can be achieved through repeated dyadic interactions. 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Optimality models predict that territory size will decrease as the costs of defence increase. One poorly understood cost is predation risk, especially the relative influence of short- versus long-term increases in predation risk. Under natural conditions, we quantified the territorial behaviour of juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, exposed to either acute or chronic increases in perceived predation risk. The effects of an acute increase in predation risk were assessed by exposing 18 young-of-the-year (YOY) Atlantic salmon to a control of stream water and to an alarm cue (i.e. conspecific skin extract) while monitoring their territorial behaviour. We investigated the effects of a chronic increase in perceived predation risk by quantifying the territorial behaviour of YOY salmon in control versus risky sections of seven sites, where we manipulated the perceived predation risk over a 4-week period by releasing stream water in control sections and alarm cue in risky sections. We found that salmon exposed to the alarm cue decreased the number of switches between foraging stations, but they did not change their territory size or foraging rate. As predicted, YOY salmon in risky sections had smaller territories than in control sections. However, their foraging rates and number of switches between foraging stations did not differ between treatments. Our study suggests that juvenile Atlantic salmon are sensitive to both acute and chronic increases in perceived predation risk under natural conditions, and support the predictions of optimality models that territory size decreases with increasing predation risk.

AB The benefits for insects using chemical information may depend on their physiological state and the behavioural context in which the chemical stimuli are perceived. Hence, insect behaviour is often characterized by olfactory plasticity. Mechanisms triggering changes in the postmating behaviour of insect females are typically mediated by constituents of the male ejaculate. Here we show that the behavioural switch displayed by mated females of the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis in response to a male abdominal sex pheromone is independent of the transfer of a male ejaculate. Rather, our results suggest a pheromone interaction in that prior exposure of a female to one pheromone and her subsequent receptivity signal modulated her response to a second one. We tested the pheromone response of females that had been experimentally prevented from receiving sperm or from experiencing certain elements of the male courtship behaviour. We show that the behavioural switch in N. vitripennis females is linked to the receptivity signal shown by females in response to a male-derived oral aphrodisiac during precopulatory courtship.

AB Flight initiation distance (FID), the distance at which an animal begins to flee from an approaching intruder, is commonly used to estimate the impact of human activities on wildlife. It reflects the level of risk tolerated by the animals. However, animals frequently approached by nonthreatening humans may progressively learn that there will be no adverse consequence for them, and thus perceive a reduced level of risk. I used an optimality model to study how this habituation process and risk allocation strategies could interact to determine FID. First, I computed the optimal FID for a foraging animal confronted with a single kind of threat. In this situation, the model predicts that FID should increase with the level of risk perceived during each encounter, and decrease when encounters become more frequent. Next, I used the model to explore what could happen after the arrival of nonthreatening humans in the environment, assuming that, initially, only predators were present. I studied how these environmental modifications could progressively affect the expectations of the forager, and its FIDs towards predators and humans. The model predicts that risk allocation strategies may either facilitate or impede habituation to nonlethal disturbance, with conflicting effects on the FIDs. Depending on the initial predation regime, the disturbance conditions created by humans and the number of predators that remain after human arrival, the animal may either progressively accept the presence of nonthreatening humans or retain a high level of sensitivity towards both predators and humans.

AB Although sexual selection is a fundamental driver of evolution, our understanding of its causes and evolutionary dynamics is often constrained by poor knowledge of mechanisms of trait function. A powerful method for assessing mechanisms of sexual selection is to combine phenotypic manipulation of male sexual traits with manipulation of behavioural interactions associated with sexual selection. We performed such experiments to assess the function of posterior gnathopods (large, sexually dimorphic claws) in mating and reproduction of Hyalella amphipods. Removal of male gnathopods reduced pairing success and shortened pairing duration. Patterns of pairing success were similar in both the absence and presence of competing males, and results were consistent across three species that live in ecologically distinct habitats. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that gnathopods in Hyalella function during the interactions between males and females that lead to pair formation, and such functions are relatively conserved within the Hyalella species complex. Finally, our findings for gnathopod function in Hyalella contrast markedly with a recent study of gnathopod function in another amphipod, Gammarus pulex, indicating that enlarged gnathopods may have diverse functions among mate-guarding amphipod species.

AB One strategy for coping with the constraints on acoustic signal reception posed by ambient noise is to signal louder as noise levels increase. Termed the 'Lombard effect', this reflexive behaviour is widespread among birds and mammals and occurs with a diversity of signal types, leading to the hypothesis that voice amplitude regulation represents a general vertebrate mechanism for coping with environmental noise. Support for this evolutionary hypothesis, however, remains limited due to a lack of studies in taxa other than birds and mammals. Here, we report the results of an experimental test of the hypothesis that male grey treefrogs increase the amplitude of their advertisement calls in response to increasing levels of chorus-shaped noise. We recorded spontaneously produced calls in quiet and in the presence of noise broadcast at sound pressure levels ranging between 40 dB and 70 dB. While increasing noise levels induced predictable changes in call duration and rate, males did not regulate call amplitude. These results do not support the hypothesis that voice amplitude regulation is a generic vertebrate mechanism for coping with noise. We discuss the possibility that intense sexual selection and high levels of competition for mates in choruses place some frogs under strong selection to call consistently as loudly as possible.

AB All socially living animals are confronted with the challenge of competing over limited resources. When resources are movable a relatively open empirical question concerns how potential competitors recognize that another individual has a claim on a resource and when such claims should be respected. Here we address these dual features of competition in free-ranging rhesus monkeys by creating a competitive foraging task involving two food options, and for each condition, manipulating different aspects of the competitor's potential competitive advantage. Specifically, we focused on aspects of the competitor's physical connection to the food, and his attentional state and proximity. Results show that if the competitor had a physical connection to the food, rhesus respected the competitor's claim. Even when this connection had been temporarily relinquished, rhesus nevertheless respected the competitor's claim so long as proximity and attention to the resource were maintained. If, however, the competitor maintained a physical connection to one food source, but attended away from the food, subjects no longer respected the competitive advantage. Lastly, if a physical connection was made to one food option, but the experimenter was proximate to the other option, subjects were at chance in their choice, suggesting that proximity and physical connection represent conflicting competitive cues. These results reveal that rhesus monkeys use a variety of cues when recognizing and respecting competitive advantages. We discuss these results in relation to recent research on the evolution and ontogeny of our concepts of property and ownership. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Studies of plant-pollinator interactions have often documented species differences in preferences for floral advertisements and rewards. However, the contribution of intraspecific variation in behaviours, especially between sexes, remains less understood. We explored resource preference and resource use by male and female Manduca sexta hawkmoths, relative to two important nectar resources in southern Arizona, U. S. A. Manduca sexta is the major pollinator of one of these species (Datura wrightii, Solanaceae). Because females must also seek out D. wrightii as an oviposition resource, females were predicted to feed upon it more than would males, which should be free to choose the best nectar resource. Using naive laboratory-reared moths in flight arena experiments, we found that both sexes preferred Datura wrightii over Agave palmeri (Agavaceae). Exposure to only one species and an odourless paper control, however, revealed sex-specific differences in foraging behaviour, with females feeding longer from A. palmeri and males feeding longer from D. wrightii, leading us to reject our hypothesis. Differences in feeding preferences directly translated into differences in energy intake. Females gained significantly more energy than did males by feeding from A. palmeri. We also examined whether behavioural preferences of moths in the laboratory translated into foraging behaviour in the field. Pollen load analysis of moths caught in 2004 showed that females carried significantly more A. palmeri pollen than did males, whereas males carried more D. wrightii pollen than did females. Whereas most studies examine pollination associations at the species level, our results highlight the potential importance of between-sex variation in floral visits.

AB Variation in sexual signals across populations is a common phenomenon, and most research to date has found that individuals discriminate against nonlocal signals. However, the strength of nonlocal signal discrimination can vary asymmetrically across populations, a possibility that has received less attention. Such asymmetries can be due to recognition errors in some populations, variation across populations in the 'quality' of local individuals, such that populations with high-quality individuals respond more strongly, and/or variation in the perception of signals, with signals from some populations being perceived as more intimidating or aggressive. Here, we examine song differences and male responsiveness to local and nonlocal songs in two populations of the black-throated blue warbler, Dendroica caerulescens, and also explore possible reasons for geographical variation in responsiveness. In the northern population, male responses were stronger to local songs than to nonlocal songs, whereas in the southern population, male responses to local and nonlocal songs did not differ. Overall responsiveness did not differ between the populations, and songs from one population were not responded to more weakly (or strongly) across populations. Overall, our results fit best with a model of asymmetric recognition error. Asymmetries in nonlocal responsiveness across populations may be a common phenomenon, and can have profound effects on patterns of dispersal, mate choice and gene flow.

AB Conventional sex roles imply choosy females and nondiscriminating males. However, growing evidence suggests that male choosiness is more common than expected. While male mate choice is clearly linked to high mating investment in sex role-reversed species, factors promoting male mate choice in conventional sex role species are still debated. We addressed this fundamental issue in the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), a group-living species where members of both sexes exercise mutual mate choice to avoid inbreeding. We focused on (1) male potential reproductive rate, (2) male effective reproductive rate, and (3) male reproductive success in relation to female quality. Males tested in situations with unrestrained female availability were able to mate throughout their life, thus revealing a high potential reproductive rate. However, their effective reproductive rate was much more limited under ecologically realistic conditions with restrained female availability. In contradiction with general predictions of sex role theory, mate choice by B. germanica males occurs despite an apparent low mating investment and a male-biased operational sex ratio. The finding that inbred matings were less fertile than outbred matings reveals that kinship is the key factor promoting male choice in this particular case. In the light of inbreeding avoidance theory, we propose that by being choosy cockroach males avoid imposing inbreeding costs on their sisters, thus maximizing their own inclusive fitness via kin selection.

AB Risk is a fundamental driver of prey behaviour, but the importance of risk in the decision-making processes of top predators is poorly understood. We investigated the functions of vigilance behaviour in wild spotted hyaenas. These large carnivores have few predators but face frequent threats of attack and food theft by conspecifics. We made repeated observations of vigilance behaviour by hyaenas when they were resting, feeding and nursing, and examined variation due to age, group size, social rank, and factors related to predation risk. We used these observations to test whether vigilance functions in hyaenas to detect prey, mates, conspecific threats or interspecific threats, and whether functions differ between juveniles and adults. We found that adults were more vigilant than juveniles in all contexts. Vigilance by adults was greatest when nursing, but nursing females reduced their vigilance as cubs matured. Among both age groups, vigilance decreased with increasing group size, and hyaenas were less vigilant when feeding on high-quality food than when feeding on low-quality food. Social rank did not affect vigilance in either age group. Individual adults, but not juveniles, showed consistent patterns of vigilance within, but not between, behavioural contexts. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the primary function of vigilance in hyaenas is to detect interspecific threats. Furthermore, vigilance was context specific, and adult hyaenas showed individual variation in vigilance within behavioural contexts. These findings illustrate the relative importance of particular risks in shaping vigilance behaviour of a top carnivore. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Male reproductive success is typically mate limited, which implies that males should rarely be choosy. On the other hand, females often vary greatly in their fecundity or other determinants of male reproductive success. There are two coexisting threads in the current literature on male mate choice: a number of studies emphasize that male mate choice has been underappreciated in the past, while another set reminds us that it nevertheless evolves less easily than female choice. Here we show that when mate choice is sequential rather than simultaneous (which is often the case for the mate-limited sex), male mate choice may fail to evolve even if there is large variation among fitness prospects offered by various females, and when mating is very costly. Our model is inspired by the mating system of the sexually cannibalistic praying mantid Pseudomantis albofimbriata. Males of this species do not stop approaching females that have turned to face them even though this female behaviour greatly increases the risk of being cannibalized. We show that low mate availability can override the effect of all other factors that select for male mate choice: rejecting a current mating opportunity in the hope of better future opportunities is then not easily selected for. We conclude that studies of mate choice should examine why individuals refuse to take advantage of every opportunity, instead of merely focusing on the fact that some opportunities are better than others. Our results also call for more rigorous empirical tests of mate choice. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite their importance for group-living animals, mechanisms that prevent aggressive escalation have seldom been investigated. Conflict prevention might imply the ability to foresee future needs and the question whether animals have this capacity is still open to debate. A few studies have suggested that animals may be able to use anticipatory strategies of conflict management to decrease stress levels and prevent social tension caused by food competition. None the less, the effectiveness of these supposedly preventive strategies has rarely been investigated, and their cognitive requirements are still unclear. We explored these issues by observing a group of captive capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella, subject to fixed scheduled feeding. We collected data on affiliative and aggressive interactions during three conditions: prefeeding, feeding and control. We found that grooming increased before a predictable competitive situation such as scheduled feeding, and that grooming reduced the risk of aggressive escalation and increased co-feeding during the subsequent feeding period. Therefore, prefeeding grooming served as a conflict prevention mechanism. Nevertheless, capuchin monkeys did not specifically select their prefeeding grooming partners on the basis of the expected benefits in the future competitive situation, suggesting that they were not planning their future behaviour, but were probably responding to the current tense situation.

AB Locating potential mates is critical to mating. We studied males' association with females and mate-searching patterns in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a promiscuous live-bearer. In the field, we examined whether male guppies respond differently to a shoal of conspecific fish based on the members of the shoal. We found that more males were attracted to shoals that contained receptive females than to shoals of nonreceptive females or males. We also conducted laboratory experiments to investigate how males use olfactory cues of nonreceptive and receptive females to search for and associate with females. We gave males the option to associate with nonreceptive females when olfactory cues of receptive or nonreceptive females were present and absent, and when olfactory cues were presented alone. Males associated with females most strongly when both cues were presented simultaneously, but when cues were presented separately males' association with females differed with respect to the olfactory cues that were added. Males associated with females equally with visual and olfactory cues presented separately when the odour cues were from receptive females. However, when the odour cues were from nonreceptive females, males associated with females less with olfactory than visual cues. Searching activity increased when males had access only to olfactory cues. Taken together these results suggest that olfactory cues influence males' association with females and searching behaviour, and these changes in behaviour are likely to maximize a male's opportunity to encounter receptive females.

AB According to life history theory, males of iteroparous species are expected to trade off investment between current and future reproduction based on age ( mating strategy or terminal investment hypotheses) or body condition ( individual quality hypothesis). However, although central to this latter model, the question concerning whether and to what extent condition regulates competitive investment in polygynous species is unknown. Consequently, we investigated this issue with reference to fight structure in fallow deer contests. Support for the individual quality hypothesis was limited: males with larger necks as determined by prerut neck girth fought for longer than males with smaller necks. However, prime-aged males had higher investment in fighting than preprime- or postprime-aged males indicating that investment in fighting might be age related. Other aspects of our results also failed to support condition-related predictions; although we found that jump clashing and vocal rate were related to weight loss and decline in neck girth, respectively, there was no relationship between investment in fighting and prerut measures of body size. Moreover, we also found that rank was predicted by investment in fighting ( backward pushing) rather than body condition. Our results show that, in addition to body condition and age, variation in competitive investment between individuals also influences reproductive effort in the fallow deer.

AB In many animals, mating takes place after natal dispersal. Consequently, use of reliable information is required to increase the probability of encounters between the sexes. Most of the studies on mate finding in parasitoid insects have focused on the role of a single information source: a sex pheromone. Other sources have been mostly ignored. We studied the nature of olfactory information used for mate finding by the parasitoid Venturia canescens both at a distance and at host patch level, and investigated how this information is used. We tested which sex attracts the other and whether mate location is improved by combining different sources of information. We found that males simultaneously used two types of olfactory cues to find their mate: information directly related to females and an environmental cue provided by hosts. Male efficiency in locating virgin females was enhanced threefold by the association of females with hosts, whereas host patches, on their own, were unattractive to males. Our results also suggest that females emit a volatile pheromone. At the host patch level, males used chemical marks left by females foraging for hosts. These results led us to consider the distinction between signals and cues and we suggest that the volatile pheromone emitted by the females, always described as a signal, could rather be a cue. Although evidence for a volatile sex pheromone is pervasive in parasitoids, our study stresses the role of other cues in mate-finding strategies.

AB Behavioural lateralization has been observed in many species of fishes during stimulus-specific tasks. However, one area that has been overlooked is the study of naive side bias in motor behaviour of fishes in the absence of direct visual stimulus. To this end, we examined naive side biases in motor behaviour in five species of minnows (Osteichthyes: Cyprinidae). Fifteen individuals of each species were subjected to a T-shaped test arena, with 40 randomized replicates per individual. We took advantage of rheotaxis by running a slow current of water through each arm of the test apparatus. Of the 75 individuals tested, 55 showed a rightward turning preference. The overall right-biased behaviour observed in these fishes in the absence of systematic stimulus strongly suggests that a stimulus-free control condition be included in the experimental design whenever plausible for studies of laterality in fishes and presumably in other organisms.

AB Individual characteristics and choices can influence social structure in animal groups. Social behaviour is likely to change throughout an individual's life, resulting in different social roles at different ages. Individuals may also choose to interact differently with others based on their age, sex or kinship. We used social network analysis to examine biological correlates of individual social variation in free-living groups of yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris. To measure social variation, we chose network measures that reflect an individual's tendency to initiate or receive both direct and indirect interactions. We asked how age, sex and kinship influenced patterns of affiliative ( socially cohesive) and agonistic ( socially competitive) interactions. Specifically, we predicted that individuals would vary in their tendency to initiate and receive interactions according to these characteristics, and that they would be more likely to interact affiliatively with more similar individuals and to interact agonistically with more dissimilar individuals. We found that patterns of direct and indirect interactions changed significantly with age, with younger animals being more involved in affiliative interactions and older animals initiating more agonistic ones. Furthermore, affiliative networks tended to be structured by age and kinship. Our results suggest that yearling yellow-bellied marmots are more important for maintaining social cohesion than has previously been recognized, and that marmot colonies are largely organized based on age group and kinship.

AB To investigate the ecological significance of personality, researchers generally measure behavioural traits in captivity. Whether behaviour in captivity is analogous to behaviour in the wild, however, is seldom tested. We compared individual behaviour between captivity and the wild in blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Over two winters, 125 blue tits were briefly brought into captivity to measure exploratory tendency and neophobia using variants of standard personality assays. Each was then released, fitted with a passive integrated transponder. Using an electronic monitoring system, we then recorded individuals' use of feeders as they foraged in the wild. We used variation in the discovery of new feeders to score 91 birds for exploratory tendency in the wild. At eight permanent feeding stations, 78 birds were assayed for neophobia in the wild. Behavioural variation in the captive personality trials was independent of permanent (e.g. sex) and nonpermanent (e.g. condition or weather) sources of between-individual variation at capture. Individual exploratory tendency and neophobia were consistent and repeatable in captivity, and analogous traits were repeatable in the wild; thus all constituted personality traits in the blue tit. Exploratory tendency and neophobia were not correlated with each other, in either the captive or the wild context. Therefore they are independent traits in blue tits, in contrast to many species. Finally, exploratory tendency and neophobia measured in captivity positively predicted the analogous traits measured in the wild. Reflecting differences in the use of feeding opportunities, personality in captivity therefore revealed relevant differences in foraging behaviour between individuals.

AB While many domestic and laboratory animals recognize familiar humans, such ability in wild animals is only anecdotally known. Here we demonstrate experimentally that a cognitively advanced, social bird, the American crow, Corvus brachyrhynchos, quickly and accurately learns to recognize the face of a dangerous person and continues to do so for at least 2.7 years. We exposed wild crows to a novel 'dangerous face' by wearing a unique face mask as we trapped, banded and released 7-15 birds at five sites near Seattle, WA, U. S. A. After trapping, crows consistently used harsh vocalizations to scold and mob people of different sizes, ages, genders and walking gaits who wore the dangerous mask, even when they were in crowds. In contrast, prior to trapping, few crows scolded people who wore the dangerous mask. Furthermore, after trapping, few crows scolded trappers who wore no mask or who wore a mask that had not been worn during trapping. In a fully crossed, balanced experiment in which each site had a unique trapping (dangerous) mask and five neutral masks, crows scolded and mobbed a mask more when it was the dangerous mask at that site than when it was a neutral mask at another site. When simultaneously presented with a person in the dangerous mask and a person in the neutral mask, crows typically ignored the neutral mask and followed and scolded the person wearing the dangerous mask. Risky, aggressive scolding by crows was sensitive to variable costs across study sites; aggression was less where people persecuted crows most. We suggest that conditioned and observational learning of specific threats may allow local bird behaviours to include aversions to individual people.

AB Precopulatory male mate guarding is predicted to occur close to the female's fertile period. However, in many species mate guarding commences when females are juveniles and may be several moults from sexual maturity. Such behaviour is inconsistent with the above prediction. In the Zeus bug, Phoreticovelia disparata, sexual size dimorphism is very pronounced and adult males commence riding on the backs of juvenile fourth-instar females. Males derive direct benefits from this association but the fitness consequences of precopulatory male riding behaviour for females are unknown. We investigated the effect of male presence during juvenile development for female Zeus bugs. We found a dramatic cost of male riding for females allocated a mate from the fourth instar: they were less likely to survive to adulthood and had substantially reduced adult longevity. These costs were significantly reduced for females allocated a mate during their fifth instar or as adults. We found no evidence that male presence affected female development time, adult size, body shape or the number of melanized dorsal scars present on their abdomen. Our study indicates that adult females and older juvenile females (fifth instar) are adapted to bear the costs imposed by riding males but that sexual conflict is likely to be intense between males and fourth-instar females. We suggest that the Zeus bug mating system originates from both sexes striving to make the best of a bad job: males ride immature females in the absence of unguarded adult females and females permit riding males as a form of convenience polyandry.

AB Compared to other mammals, sexual signals occur particularly often within the primate order. Nevertheless, little is known so far about the pressures under which these signals evolved. We studied loud calls in wild crested macaques to examine whether these are used as a sexual signal, particularly as a signal of dominance, in this species. Since the structure of loud calls may be influenced by the context in which they are uttered, we tested for contextual differences in call structure. Only males uttered loud calls and analysis of 194 loud calls given by 15 males showed that call structure encoded the caller's identity as well as his social status. Dominance rank was also reflected in the frequency with which males called with alpha males calling most often. The structure of loud calls, however, was not influenced by context. Our findings consolidate the assumption that, in crested macaques, loud calls serve as a signal of dominance, most probably used to prevent contests between males for mates. We herewith provide the first direct evidence for a signal of dominance in a tolerant primate species and discuss why this signal occurs in only one sex.

AB Avian brood parasites typically depress the fitness of their hosts by reducing the number of host offspring produced, yet little is known about how parasitic nestlings influence the behaviour of host parents and host offspring. In this study, we used three hosts of the brown-headed cowbird, Molothrus ater, that varied in size (i.e. smaller, similar to and larger than cowbirds of a given age) to determine whether parasitic nestlings altered patterns of food provisioning by host parents and begging by host young under field conditions. Adult provisioning did not change in the presence of a cowbird but instead was influenced by feeding treatment and host size. In parasitized broods where nestlings differed in size (i.e. the small and large hosts), the larger nestling received the majority of food brought to the nest, regardless of whether it was the cowbird or host nestling. In contrast, similar-sized host nestlings received a similar amount of food in parasitized and unparasitized host broods. Relative to unparasitized broods, the presence of a cowbird led to increased begging intensity by the small host, had no clear effect on begging behaviour of the intermediate-sized host, and reduced begging intensity of the large host. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of a cowbird did not lead to changes in provisioning behaviour in parents, and the extent to which cowbirds influenced host begging behaviour depended on the size of the host.

AB In many species, body size is a key determinant of the outcome of agonistic interactions, and receivers are expected to attend to size cues when assessing competitors' signals. Several mammal vocalizations, including domestic dog growls, encode reliable information about caller body size in the dispersion of formant frequencies. To test whether adult domestic dogs attend to formant dispersion when presented with the growls of their conspecifics, we played recordings of resynthesized growls where the size-related variation in formant frequency spacing was manipulated independently of all other parameters. Subjects from three different size groups (small, medium and large dogs) were presented with playbacks of growls where formant frequencies had been rescaled to correspond to a dog 30% smaller or 30% larger than themselves. While large dogs systematically displayed more motivation to interact when growls simulated a smaller intruder, small dogs did not respond differentially to the playback conditions. However, the small dogs responded significantly less than all other size groups to both playback conditions. Our results suggest that domestic dogs are able to perceive size-related information in growls, and more specifically that they are able to adapt their behavioural response as a function of the perceived intruder's size relative to their own.

AB Optimal cache spacing theory predicts that scatter-hoarding animals store food at a density that balances the gains of reducing cache robbery against the costs of spacing out caches further. We tested the key prediction that cache robbery and cache spacing increase with the economic value of food: the ratio of food to consumer abundance. We quantified cache pilferage and cache spacing by the Central American agouti, Dasyprocta punctata, in the tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama, across 10 1 ha plots that encompassed a more than 100-fold range in the availability of Astrocaryum palm seeds, the agouti's principal food. We found that caches were pilfered at higher rates in plots with lower seed availability, and that agoutis cached seeds further away and into lower densities where seed availability was lower. Food scarcity apparently increased the pressure of food competitors on caches, stimulating agoutis to put more effort into caching seeds to create lower cache densities, fully consistent with theory. We conclude that the optimal cache density depends not only on the nutritional value of food but also on the economic value, which may vary in space as well as time.

AB Males are often selected for higher mating rates than females. As a consequence of this sexual conflict, unreceptive females may suffer fitness costs from excessive male sexual harassment. In a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species, multiple female morphs coexist in natural populations which have been observed to differ in body colour, in behaviour and also in the amount of male harassment received. However, the degree of harassment on a female morph may depend on the frequency and density of males and female morphs in the population. We quantified harassment rate and subsequent refusal behaviour of males and female morphs of the polymorphic damselfly Nehalennia irene. Unexpectedly and contrary to previous work, female morphs received similar amounts of male harassment and showed mostly the same behaviour. We discuss why differences in morph behaviours may be lacking and how this compares to contemporary explanations for the maintenance and evolution of female-limited polymorphisms.

AB The use of video playbacks may provide a promising technique for the study of social behaviour because it allows experimenters to present a diverse set of behavioural patterns while precisely controlling what the observer experiences. However, in order to validate this technique for social foraging contexts, we must first show that video playbacks can effectively simulate foraging in the presence of foraging groups. A well-documented behavioural response of group-living animals to an increase in group size is a decline in individual levels of vigilance coupled with an increase in foraging rate: the so-called group size effect. We investigated this in captive nutmeg mannikins, Lonchura punctulata, by noting the vigilance and foraging behaviour of focal birds exposed to different numbers of either real or video-simulated companions. Similar patterns of changes in scanning and foraging were observed with changes in both real and simulated group sizes; the birds increased their feeding rate and decreased the time devoted to scanning. The video playback technique therefore provides an effective and appropriate technique for investigating social foraging questions. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The study of sex allocation is one of the most productive areas in evolutionary biology, with considerable interplay between theoretical and empirical work. However, observed sex ratios are often measured after developmental periods and they may not reflect primary sex investment ratios, which is what theory predicts. We examined with the sex ratio behaviour of the parasitoid wasp Melittobia, in which males do not disperse from their natal patch. In contrast with the well-supported predictions of local mate competition (LMC) theory, the extremely female-biased sex ratio observed at emergence changes little in response to ovipositing female number. We examined (1) the primary sex ratio at oviposition and (2) the pattern of male production over time, to test whether the inconsistency with LMC theory can be explained by differential developmental mortality between the sexes. We found that the sex ratio at oviposition measured with a microsatellite DNA marker did not differ from the sex ratio at emergence, indicating that differential developmental mortality is absent or weak. We also found that males were constantly produced throughout the period of oviposition after a single male was produced initially. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal signals are often complex, raising the possibility that different aspects of a signal may convey different types of information. Birdsong, for example, may simultaneously advertise the singer's condition during early life (through song complexity), location of song learning (through local song structure) and current condition (through song output). Each of these aspects of song is behaviourally salient: females generally prefer complex over simple song, local over nonlocal song, and high over low rates of song output. We examined the degree to which these three components of song convey complementary versus redundant information, in eastern song sparrows, Melospiza melodia melodia. One measure of song complexity, syllable repertoire size, was positively related to syllable sharing with other birds in the local population. This finding suggests that these aspects convey somewhat redundant information and that local-sounding song may in part advertise song-learning ability. A second measure of song complexity, song repertoire size, was positively related to song output, despite the widely differing developmental timescales over which song complexity and output are thought to vary. Condition during early development may have carryover effects on adult condition; alternatively, complex singers may have most to gain from advertising this attractive signal. Finally, despite our finding that both syllable sharing and song output were related to song complexity, syllable sharing and song output were not themselves significantly correlated. Overall, the three ostensibly independent aspects of song investigated here appear to overlap substantially in the information they convey. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In certain species of salmon, male phenotypes occur in two distinct morphs: the large 'hooknose' or the small 'jack'. Hooknoses fight each other for access to females, while jacks occupy refuges near spawning beds to sneak fertilizations. Jacks also fight each other over opportunities for sneaking without immediate gains. To explore whether the jack behavioural strategy is equally adaptive to that of the hooknose, we built a game-theoretic model similar to the classic hawk-dove game, with and without conditions of density dependence. Our model demonstrates that fitness of the jack strategy increases with the frequency of the hooknose strategy, because jacks can steal the benefits otherwise accrued by hooknoses. The coexistence of strategies is much more easily achieved in this game than in the hawk-dove game. When negative density effects on benefits are introduced to the model, coexistence conditions are further relaxed. Hence, the jack and hooknose strategies can be viewed as equally adaptive, resulting in a stable mixed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS).

AB It has been suggested that secondary sexual ornamentation signals male ability to resist infections, as only high-quality individuals are able to invest both in high immune defence and elaborate ornament expression. Such ornaments could thus serve as indicators of male quality and could be used by females in choosing mates. Ostriches are sexually dimorphic with regard to coloration of their feathers, bill, neck and legs, and have a promiscuous mating system, with a high degree of reproductive skew, particularly in males. We investigated the relationship between the coloration of the feathers, bill, neck and legs of 15 male ostriches, maintained in a breeding flock, and the cell-mediated (measured using a phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) injection) and humoral components of their immune systems, as well as their heterophil: lymphocyte ratio. We found that male responses to PHA injection and humoral responses to tetanus were predicted by leg coloration, humoral responses to diphtheria were predicted by white feather coloration, and the heterophil: lymphocyte ratio was related to bill coloration. These traits, which relate to male immune capacity, are exposed during male-male interactions and courtship display, so we suggest that these visual cues could provide valuable information on male quality to females (as well as rival males), forming the basis of mate choice in this species.

AB There is increasing interest in individual differences in animal behaviour. Recent research now suggests that an individual's behaviour, once considered to be plastic, may be more predictable than previously thought. Here, we take advantage of the large number of studies that have estimated the repeatability of various behaviours to evaluate whether there is good evidence for consistent individual differences in behaviour and to answer some outstanding questions about possible factors that can influence repeatability. Specifically, we use meta-analysis to ask whether different types of behaviours were more repeatable than others, and if repeatability estimates depended on taxa, sex, age, field versus laboratory, the number of measures and the interval between measures. Some of the overall patterns that were revealed by this analysis were that repeatability estimates were higher in the field compared to the laboratory and repeatability was higher when the interval between observations was short. Mate preference behaviour was one of the best studied but least repeatable behaviours. Our findings prompt new insights into the relative flexibility of different types of behaviour and offer suggestions for the design and analysis of future research.

AB Contest competition and male dispersal have evolved a number of times in pollinating fig wasps. Given their highly female-biased sex ratios and high relatedness between competing males, this phenomenon is surprising. Using a comparative approach, we found a significant association between high adult sex ratios (male:female), fighting and dispersal. We conclude that a relatively high proportion of males could have led to the evolution of fighting and to excess males that avoid kin conflict through dispersal. These wasps respond to increased competition between relatives by altering the scale at which they compete, but also by competing more intensely. In support of the new generation of kin selection models, we found that relatedness of competing males has no effect on the likelihood of fighting. Even so, selection at a higher hierarchical level has selected for dispersal and hence a larger scale at which competition occurs. We found that although the sex ratio gives a rough indication of the mating system it fails to be accurate at a finer scale. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The evolutionary history of most behaviours remains unknown. Here, we assay burrowing behaviour of seven species of deer mice in standardized environments to determine how burrowing evolved in this genus (Peromyscus). We found that several, but not all, species burrow even after many generations of captive breeding. Specifically, there were significant and repeatable differences in both the frequency of burrowing and burrow shape between species. Moreover, these observed species-specific behaviours resemble those reported in wild mice. These results suggest that there is probably a strong genetic component to burrowing in deer mice. We also generated a phylogeny for these seven species using characters from four mtDNA and two autosomal loci. Mapping burrowing behaviour onto this phylogeny suggests a sequence for how complex burrowing evolves: from small, simple burrows to long, multi-tunnel burrows with defined entrance and escape tunnels. In particular, the most 'complex' burrows of P. polionotus appear to be derived. These behavioural data, when examined in a phylogenetic context, show that even closely related species differ in their burrowing behaviours and that the most complex burrows probably evolved by the gradual accumulation of genetic change over time.

AB Adopting a stoichiometric perspective (e. g. the balance of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in organisms and their resources) has enhanced our understanding of ecological phenomena at a variety of hierarchical levels of organization. Unfortunately, little is presently known about how stoichiometry directly influences animal behaviour. Here we use a stoichiometric perspective to investigate how phosphorus availability in the environment influences mate attraction behaviour in insects. Using adult male European house crickets (Acheta domesticus), we manipulated the availability of dietary phosphorus and we quantified how survival, propensity to signal acoustically or not ('signallers' versus nonsignalling 'silent' males) and lifetime mate attraction signalling were affected. Dietary phosphorus availability did not influence the proportion of signallers versus silent males. However, signallers fed a diet rich in phosphorus had significantly higher signalling efforts than those that consumed a phosphorus-poor diet. Interestingly, signallers also lived longer than silent males, but neither signaller nor silent male survival was influenced by diet. Our findings suggest that the availability of dietary phosphorus has the potential to impact mating system evolution. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The study of breeding habitat selection has focused mainly on physical characteristics of the environment such as nest sites and food abundance, both of which are required for successful reproduction. However, individuals may have limited time to make settlement decisions, and thus, their knowledge of resource availability may be incomplete. Furthermore, food abundance during settlement may not reflect levels later in the breeding season. An alternative perspective is that the most direct measure of habitat suitability is derived from social information such as the presence of conspecifics (conspecific attraction) or their reproductive performance (habitat copying). We tested resource and socially based hypotheses of habitat selection in a population of eastern kingbirds, Tyrannus tyrannus, at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon, U.S.A. Kingbirds nested in areas with a greater proportion of suitable nest trees than what was generally available, but many areas with suitable numbers of trees went unused. Kingbirds also settled in areas of relatively high insect abundance, but only in years when overall abundance was low. We also found support for the socially based hypotheses. Relative to where they nested previously, kingbirds tended to settle in areas of higher conspecific density. But, we found stronger evidence in favour of habitat copying, suggesting that dispersing individuals settled in areas that produced more fledglings in the previous year. Kingbirds thus appeared to select breeding habitat based, in part, on resource availability, but dispersal decisions may be influenced by social information, primarily past reproductive success of conspecifics.

AB Animals assess many factors when choosing how aggressively to behave during interspecific competitive interactions. Aggressive behaviour can help win resources, but it can also be costly. Here we tested how context such as competitor familiarity, habitat type and resource value affect competitive behaviour using two ant species, Formica xerophila and F. integroides. We found that competitive encounters within an individual's territory yielded more aggressive interactions than encounters in a neutral arena, and aggression towards competitors increased with resource value. Using a recently developed design combining behaviour assays between live ant dyads and ants paired with glass beads chemically resembling competitors, we isolated an individual's behaviour during an encounter to show that its behaviour can be significantly affected by the behaviour of its competitor during the interaction. Furthermore, we determined that context can affect each species differently, and that these differences are consistent with differences in overall fighting abilities. Formica integroides from trees (but not from nests) behaved differently towards live and artificial F. xerophila. Formica integroides are behaviourally dominant, which facilitates a strategy wherein individuals aggressively defend the nest but reciprocate the behaviours of their opponents (showing an interspecific Tit-for-Tat strategy) when defending less valuable locations. Formica xerophila are generally submissive, which favours a highly context-dependent strategy. In particular, F. xerophila discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar F. integroides, and behave more aggressively towards foreign competitors than towards neighbouring competitors. Differences between species' behaviours suggest that these interspecific interactions are dynamic context-dependent associations that cannot be reduced to a static dominance hierarchy.

AB Predation risk is an important factor affecting investment decisions in wild birds. The parental risk-taking response is assumed to depend on the value of the current brood, but to date empirical studies have yielded equivocal results. We tested the 'reproductive value of the offspring' ( RV) hypothesis by assuming that parents perceive the probability of offspring survival as a significant component of RV. We predicted that survival of offspring as perceived by parents would be inversely related to the level of brood reduction. Accordingly, parents with the same number of offspring may take fewer risks if they have lost offspring than if they have not. We experimentally reduced brood size in a small passerine, the pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, and exposed parents to a stuffed sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, a predator of adults. For a given brood size, the time elapsed until parents first entered the nestbox after removal of the predator was positively correlated with the level of brood reduction. Parental risk-taking behaviour was not affected by brood size per se when adjusted for the level of brood reduction. No sex-related differences in antipredator responses were found. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that birds are capable of perceiving brood reduction and of adjusting their antipredator behaviour to the changed value of their offspring.

AB Competition between species can include signal competition in addition to competition for space and resources. Fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) are an excellent system for examining visual signal competition given their use of visual displays and burrow structures such as sand hoods. Where fiddler crab species overlap in habitat, females may face challenges as signal receivers to avoid heterospecifics and simultaneously discriminate among conspecific males. We investigated the consequences of competition between two species, U. latimanus and U. musica, which both build hoods and intermingle in the same habitat. Males of U. latimanus were larger than U. musica and had claws that were relatively shorter but potentially more powerful, suggesting that U. latimanus may be a superior competitor in direct combat. The hoods of the two species differed significantly in average size and shape, and in areas where they had heterospecific neighbours, U. musica males built hoods that were more distinct from heterospecific hoods, whereas U. latimanus built hoods that were more similar to heterospecific hoods. Wandering male U. musica were less likely to approach heterospecific than conspecific males, whereas U. latimanus were not. Wandering females of both species approached significantly more conspecific than heterospecific males, although some U. musica females entered heterospecific burrows. Uca latimanus females were significantly more attracted to conspecifics with hoods than without hoods; and although U. musica females showed the same tendency, the trend was only marginally significant. The high density of heterospecific males may reduce the ability of female U. musica to discriminate among conspecific males. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We used a novel 'three-bowl' method to investigate social effects on feeding and drinking in domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus. The method was designed to distinguish between two social-learning processes, 'response facilitation' and 'local enhancement'. We presented three bowls, each containing food or water, and recorded the onset and offset of bouts of feeding or drinking at each bowl. We then modelled the rate of feeding or drinking of each individual as a function of the recent behaviour of its conspecifics. An actionspecific effect is consistent with response facilitation, whereas a location-specific effect is consistent with local enhancement. Drinking was subject to response facilitation, which acted to synchronize individuals' drinking behaviour. For feeding, although no evidence was found for a response facilitation effect, there was evidence for local enhancement. However, the social influence on feeding was offset by avoidance of feeding competition, which acted to reduce behavioural synchrony. Our methodology is a novel approach to studying social-learning processes within freely interacting groups of animals, and could be adapted for use with different actions and on other species.

AB Within insect and anuran choruses, females are exposed to many male sexual signals overlapping in time. In many species, male call timing influences mate choice, with females preferentially orienting towards males that succeed in calling just before their opponents. The mechanisms through which males actively regulate their call timing to achieve this have been the focus of much interest. However, no study has addressed the problem of the reliability of call leadership as an indicator of male quality, which is crucial to females, since basing their choice of mate on an unreliable criterion could lead them to engage in suboptimal matings, with detrimental effects to their fitness. Addressing this question in the European treefrog, Hyla arborea, we first ascertained that females preferentially orient towards the first of two identical overlapping conspecific calls. We then found that within experimental choruses the males with the highest proportion of leading calls had significantly higher total calling times, a call characteristic encompassing two indicators of signal costliness: call duration and call rate. Although we failed to find a link between call leadership and male body condition, this study provides novel evidence that female preference for leading calls leads to the selection of the males with the highest energetic investment in their sexual display. The handicap principle predicts that this form of female preference should increase the fitness of females by guaranteeing that they select high-quality mates.

AB For web-building spiders, a current hypothesis states that silk structure is involved in intraspecific communication, and could play a major role in regulating social relations. To test this hypothesis, we studied a subsocial spider, Coelotes terrestris (Araneae). During their lifetime, individuals of this species successively experience a social period (parental female and young stages, from hatching to dispersal) and a solitary period (postdispersal young to adult stage). We therefore expected the link between an individual and its web to change depending on whether it was in its subsocial or solitary period. We conducted two complementary studies. Behavioural tests showed that the webs of incubating females were attractive to mated females and the webs of parental females repelled virgin spiders. Dispersal of young spiders was accompanied by characteristic changes in the chemical components of the mother's web. Chromatographic analyses of individual webs revealed the presence of 48 different compounds. The components were alcohol, fatty acids and long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons. Quantitative as well as qualitative changes in chemical profiles correlated strongly with the physiological state of the spiders that made them. Bioassays showed that the spatial distribution of the spider was influenced by these chemical compounds. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sequential integration' represents a form of auditory grouping in which temporally separated sounds produced by the same source are perceptually bound together over time into a coherent 'auditory stream'. In humans, sequential integration is important in music and speech perception. In this study of the grey treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, we took advantage of female selectivity for advertisement calls with conspecific pulse rates to investigate common spatial location as a cue for sequential integration. We presented females with two temporally interleaved pulse sequences with pulse rates of 25 pulses/s, which is half the conspecific pulse rate and more similar to that of H. versicolor, a syntopically breeding heterospecific. We tested the hypothesis that common spatial origin between the two pulse sequences would promote their integration into a coherent auditory stream with an attractive conspecific pulse rate. As the spatial separation between the speakers broadcasting the interleaved pulse sequences decreased from 180 degrees to 0 degrees, more females responded and females had shorter response latencies and travelled shorter distances en route to a speaker. However, even in the 180 degrees condition, most females (74%) still responded. Detailed video analyses revealed no evidence that patterns of female phonotaxis resulted from impaired abilities to localize sound sources in the spatially separated conditions. Together, our results suggest that females were fairly permissive of spatial incoherence between the interleaved pulse sequences and that common spatial origin may be only a relatively weak cue for sequential integration in grey treefrogs.

AB Humans experiencing different background emotional states display contrasting cognitive ( e. g. judgement) biases when responding to ambiguous stimuli. We have proposed that such biases may be used as indicators of animal emotional state. Here, we used a spatial judgement task, in which animals were trained to expect food in one location and not another, to determine whether rats in relatively positive or negative emotional states respond differently to ambiguous stimuli of intermediate spatial location. We housed 24 rats with environmental enrichment for 7 weeks. We removed the enrichment from half the animals prior to the start of training to induce a relatively negative emotional state, whereas we left it in place for the remaining rats. After 6 training days, the rats successfully discriminated between the rewarded and the unrewarded locations in terms of an increased latency to arrive at the unrewarded location, with no housing treatment difference. The subjects then underwent 3 days of testing in which three ambiguous 'probe' locations, intermediate between the rewarded and the unrewarded locations, were introduced. There was no difference between the treatments in the rats' judgement of two of the three probe locations, the exception being when the ambiguous probe was positioned closest to the unrewarded location. This result suggests that rats housed without enrichment, and in an assumed relatively negative emotional state, respond differently to an ambiguous stimulus compared to rats housed with enrichment, providing evidence that cognitive biases may be used to assess animal emotional state in a spatial judgement task.

AB Females of many species display overt behavioural signs that provide information to males about their willingness to mate. We have observed female swordtails (Xiphophorus cortezi) performing 'headstands' and/or 'pecks' towards the substrate of their tank in the presence of males. To determine whether this behaviour is an attempt at foraging, a mating signal or a sign of aggression or stress, we exposed satiated individual female swordtails to either no fish, a female or a male fish and measured association time and frequency of headstand/pecking behaviours. Females did not perform these behaviours when there was no other fish in the tank. Although they spent equal amounts of time associating with either a male or female stimulus fish, they only performed headstands/pecks in the presence of males. Furthermore, in dichotomous choice tests with large and small males, females preferred to associate with large males and performed significantly more headstands/pecks in their presence. Finally, males were simultaneously exposed to videos of a free-swimming female and the same female intermittently pecking the bottom of the tank to examine their response to the signal. Larger males spent more time with and performed more courtship behaviours towards the pecking female, whereas smaller males spent more time associating with and courting the freely swimming female. These results suggest that headstands/pecks performed by female swordtails in the presence of males may be a signal of a female's willingness to mate and that the size of a male affects his response to this signal.

AB Individuals of Cerithidea decollata periodically migrate along mangrove trees, resting on the trunks during high water, and foraging on the surrounding muddy platform during low water. Groups, ranging from tens to hundreds of snails, aggregate on the trunks well before the incoming tide (1-2 h) at a level that will not be reached by the high tide, that is, from a few centimetres (around neap tides) to over 1 m (around spring tides) above the ground. We addressed two questions: (1) how can snails determine when to stop climbing and (2) how do snails determine the length of the path necessary to stop at that level. We used plastic pipes, 2 m long and 20 cm in diameter, along which snails crawled just as on their own trees. Experiments in which the pipes were lowered, raised or tilted indicated that snails were able to perform both tasks. Overloading the snails with lead weights showed that the estimate of the required travelling distance was probably related to the energy used to cover that distance. However, it was not possible to de. ne how snails were able to establish the distance they needed to travel to avoid the incoming tide, although we were able to exclude any role of for visual cues or chemical marks present on substratum.

AB Conclusions that human males behave more competitively than females have been tempered by recent findings that the two sexes use differing competitive strategies. Theoretically, mammalian males generally gain more than females from using riskier strategies, whereas females have more to lose. Females therefore should compete using less risky strategies. Research with humans suggests that one of these may involve alliance and coalition formation. These diminish risk yet exact a cost in terms of payoffs, suggesting that they may elicit sex-differentiated patterns of use. We examined the hypothesis that early sex-differentiated patterns would appear in which human females would form exclusionary alliances under scarce resource conditions more than males would, whereas males would use individualistic strategies more than females would. To test the hypothesis, 15 female and 14 male triads of 4-year-old children were observed under plentiful and scarce resource conditions. Under scarce resource conditions only, females formed more exclusionary alliances than males did, whereas males engaged in more individualistic competition than females did. Discussion focuses on factors that should predict sex differences in the use of coalitions.

AB Laterality or the preferential use of one or the other side of the body is associated with differential brain activity and increased specialization of brain function. Right or left biases are widespread among vertebrates and have been documented among some birds. Bill load holding or the delivery of whole prey in a bird's beak is common among terns (Charadriiformes) and many other birds. We recorded more than 2000 Caspian tern, Hydroprogne caspia, chick-feeding events for analysis of lateralization of prey within the bills of adult birds, size and shape of prey items delivered to chicks in relation to chick age, and the development of prey-handling skills among chicks. No initial lateralization of prey head position was found as adults flew into the colony, but head position of successful feeds was found to be significantly lateralized with a bias to the right side. Adults switched prey orientation significantly more often from left to right than from right to left without dropping the prey item, suggesting an adult bias. Adults appeared to adjust the length but not the shape of prey delivered according to chick age. Ability of chicks to manipulate prey items increased with age. Lateralization was most obvious in the first week of a tern's life, and adults modified their delivery behaviour to respond to these changes. Bill load-holding birds are excellent subjects to study lateralization of feeding behaviour in the wild and they may allow integration of lateralization with developmental changes.

AB Odonates exhibit a wide range of territorial and nonterritorial mating tactics and are ideal for investigating alternative reproductive behaviours. We studied male mating tactics in the American rubyspot damselfly, Hetaerina americana, a species that exhibits red wing spots that have been suggested to have evolved as a consequence of male-male contests. In this species mating success is enhanced by the ability of males to defend territories along streams and rivers, which depends on the amount of thoracic fat reserves available. Previous studies on this species have distinguished between territorial and nonterritorial males, in which the former obtain significantly more matings than the latter. In our study, however, we found a third reproductive tactic: switching. Switcher males exhibit both territorial and nonterritorial tactics and a mating success similar to that of territorial and nonterritorial males, although this result may be confounded by the small sample size used for this analysis. We suggest that the different mating tactics may be condition determined: territorial males contained the highest fat reserves, nonterritorial males had the least fat content and switchers had intermediate fat loads. We also show that there were no age differences between males using these tactics. Our results suggest that territorial behaviour is extremely plastic in this species. Finally, we discuss the implications of our study and directions for future work on territorial and nonterritorial reproductive tactics in odonates.

AB Whether aggressive displays are reliable predictors of attack is an important, unresolved issue in animal communication research. Here we test the extent to which vocal and visual displays predict subsequent attack in territorial male swamp sparrows, Melospiza georgiana. A brief playback of swamp sparrow song was used to provoke aggressive signalling from a territorial male, and the subject's displays were recorded for 5 min. A taxidermic mount of a male swamp sparrow was then revealed, coupled with additional playback, and the subject was given 14 min to attack while we continued to record its displays. Of 40 subjects, nine attacked the mount and 31 did not. For both the initial recording period and the 1 min before attack, attackers produced significantly more low-amplitude 'soft songs' and more bouts of wing waving than did nonattackers. Attackers and nonattackers did not differ significantly in song type-switching frequency or in numbers of broadcast songs, matching songs, wheezes or rasps. In discriminant function analyses, soft song was consistently the display that best predicted subsequent attack. Different acoustic forms of soft song were found, all of which appeared to be equally aggressive. Combinations of displays predicted attack better than did single displays. The overall reliability of swamp sparrow displays as predictors of aggression was impressively high. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In some group-living animals, societies are far from being static but are instead dynamic entities encompassing multiple scales of organization. We found that maternity colonies of giant noctule bats, Nyctalus lasiopterus, form fission-fusion societies, where group composition in single tree roosts changes on a daily basis but social cohesion in the larger group is preserved. The population inside a small city park was comprised of three distinct but cryptic social groups coexisting in close proximity. Each social group used a distinct roosting area, but some overlap existed in the boundaries between them. Social groups were stable at least in the mid term because adult females were loyal to roosting areas and young females returned to their natal social groups in successive years. Our results suggest that distinct social groups with separate roosting areas may have existed for at least 14 years. The findings described support the hypothesis that roost-switching behaviour in forest bats permits the maintenance of social bonds between colony members and enhances knowledge about a colony's roosting resources. Fission-fusion societies in forest bats might have evolved as a mechanism to cope with changing conditions in the environment by restructuring subgroups or adjusting subgroup size, to maximize the amount of information that can be transferred between colony members, or as a consequence of territory inheritance by philopatric female offspring. Other factors such as resource competition or kin selection could limit the size and composition of fission-fusion societies and promote strong social structuring within populations.

AB Structures built by animals may convey useful information about the builder that may be used by conspecifics in quality assessment. In fish, nest construction has been suggested to reflect qualities of individual builders, but little is known about how consistent individual differences are over time. If nest construction does reliably reflect builder quality, then we expect consistent variation between individuals in this extended phenotypic trait. We test this hypothesis in male three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, by measuring the repeatability of nest characteristics. We encouraged males, caught from four populations in mid-Wales, U.K., to complete three consecutive nests under standardized laboratory conditions. We quantified a number of structural components and design characteristics of nests and estimated repeatability (r) of these traits. Within populations, the number of threads used, the area of the nest and the mass of substrate deposited on top of the nest were all repeatable within males (0.39 < r < 0.51), showing that individual male three-spined sticklebacks differed consistently in the size and composition of the nests they produced. Our data support the hypothesis that nest characteristics may reveal important information about the quality of individual males, and that they may, at least in part, be under genetic control. We discuss these findings in the context of the evolution of nest characteristics in sticklebacks and other species. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The aggregation behaviour of fish has been extensively studied, but little is known about the shoaling of marine invertebrates. We investigated aggregation behaviour in two species of a decapod crustacean: the brown shrimp, Crangon crangon, a cryptic species that should not rely on aggregations to avoid predation, and the rockpool prawn, Palaemon elegans, a species that lives in areas without shelter and we expect to aggregate. A field survey revealed that prawns had a strongly clumped distribution, whereas shrimps only showed a tendency towards aggregating. However, size segregation was found to be strong in both species. Choice experiments in the laboratory confirmed the field results on the differences in the aggregative tendencies for the two species, as prawns showed a strong preference for shoaling with a group of five conspecifics versus a single conspecific, while shrimps only showed a trend in that direction. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for a size-assortative preference in prawns, suggesting that size segregation in the field might be a consequence of indirect or passive factors rather than individual preferences.

AB A key feature differentiating animal societies is the partitioning of reproduction among breeders. We studied how reproduction is partitioned among nestmate queens of the ant Formica exsecta in laboratory colonies. In polygynous (multiple-queen) colonies, queens can increase their reproductive success by laying more eggs or by increasing the proportion of eggs that develop into reproductive individuals instead of workers. We found that reproductive skew among queens for egg production was low, but that 84% of all queens contributed exclusively to one type of brood, either males or workers (no new queens are produced in the laboratory). Furthermore, our data revealed that the degree of reproductive specialization among queens significantly increased during brood development. Contrary to predictions of most reproductive skew models, the extent of reproductive skew was not associated with relatedness among co-breeding queens. We also found no association between the pattern of queen specialization and relatedness between queens and their mates. Such an association would occur if queens mated to related males specialize in male production to avoid the cost of inbreeding. Altogether, our findings show a yet undescribed pattern of reproductive specialization among nestmate queens in ants and emphasizes the need to investigate reproductive contributions of queens for each type of offspring separately.

AB The hypothesis that nestling coloration is important for parent-offspring communication, because it influences parental feeding decisions, has received strong experimental support. In European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, and Alpine swifts, Apus melba, manipulation of ultraviolet reflectance of nestlings' mouth and skin affected the amount of food parents provided, and skin brightness of starling nestlings predicted their T-cell-mediated immune response. Therefore, a link between nestling coloration and immunity, mediated by parental effort, was suggested. We explored this hypothesis by experimentally feeding some spotless starling, Sturnus unicolor, nestlings while leaving others in the same nest as a control. First, we found a significant effect of food supplementation on nestlings' immune response, which is a requirement for the hypothesis. Second, we confirmed in spotless starlings the association between skin brightness and ability to raise an immune response. However, this correlation disappeared when we controlled for between-nest variation. These results suggest that parental feeding preference is not the only factor explaining nestling immunity, and that covariation between mean brood nestling coloration and parental quality, and/or intrinsic (i.e. genetic) quality of nestlings, may explain the association between immunity and coloration of nestlings. Finally, within-nest variation in nestling coloration partially explained immune responses because food supplementation had more effect on nestlings with brighter skin. We discuss these results as possible evidence of nestling coloration partially reflecting intrinsic characteristics that affect both ability to produce efficient immune responses and parental feeding preferences.

AB In many species, males advertise to both male and female audiences. Given the asymmetry in fitness costs of recognition errors in response to mating signals for the sexes, usually higher for females than males, males are expected to be more permissive than females in their responses to signals. Few studies, however, have investigated such differences and there is no consensus on which sex is more permissive to signal variation. We examined the evoked vocal responses of male tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, to 14 species of heterospecic and ancestral male mating calls to evaluate the influence of call similarity and phylogenetic distance on their responses. We also compared male calling responses to female phonotactic responses to examine the propensity of response errors between the sexes. Recognition errors were higher for males than females, as predicted by the different costs associated with recognition errors for each sex. Males responded to the calls of most species with mating calls, and produced aggressive calls in response to two other heterospecific/ancestral calls. The responses of males were explained by phylogenetic distance but not by overall call similarity. Similarly, females were more likely to show phonotaxis to calls of species and ancestors that were more closely related. Therefore, evolutionary history has left a perceptual footprint on the brain of both sexes but the details seem to differ. We discuss proximate reasons underlying sexual differences in receiver permissiveness in tungara frogs and potential factors leading to their evolution.

AB Understanding the relation between behavioural processes and their population- or community-level consequences is fundamental to developing a mechanistic understanding of ecosystems. Rarely are such links made, particularly outside the laboratory, and rarely is behaviour manipulated directly through genetic or hormonal manipulation. The area that provides the greatest promise is the relation between foraging behaviour and its subsequent growth and survival consequences. In whole-lake experiments, we used domestic and wild strains of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, differing in intrinsic activity and antipredator behaviours in the laboratory, to determine whether differences in activity and habitat use between strains exist in the field and could provide a behavioural mechanism for previous studies showing a trade-off between growth and survival. Domestic trout made up the majority of gill net catches (greater overall activity), particularly in deep and pelagic habitats that had abundant food but offered little or no physical habitat structure to escape from predation. Thus, greater activity rates (inferred) and use of risky habitats (directly observed) by domestic trout provides a behaviourally mediated mechanism for previous large-scale studies showing trade-offs between growth and mortality.

   ustulatus</i>
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PIGEON COLUMBA
AB Many typically diurnal songbird species are routinely subjected to severe sleep deprivation during their seasonal, nocturnal migrations, yet they seem to suffer few of the negative consequences so obvious in sleep-deprived mammals. Studying the Swainson's thrush, a Nearctic-Neotropical long-distance migrant, we investigated seasonal changes in behaviour as possible adaptations to naturally occurring sleep loss during the migratory season. We found that captive Swainson's thrushes substantially change their daytime behaviour in response to significant loss of night-time sleep during migration, engaging in numerous episodes of daytime sleep, unilateral eye closure and drowsiness. Our observations suggest that brief episodes of sleep and sleep-like behaviour during the day, including lateralized naps in the form of unihemispheric sleep, enable migratory birds to compensate for extended periods of nocturnal sleep loss. Although episodes of daytime sleep and unilateral eye closure rarely exceed 30 s, these brief episodes, considering the short sleep cycle of birds, appear sufficiently long to provide recuperative opportunities without stretching a migrant's time budget. Importantly, the temporal structure of the daytime rest and sleep behaviour would not preclude migrants from foraging and replenishing fat deposits during a large portion of the day.

AB Parental care has been reported in more than 140 species of reptiles (about 3%), but few records unambiguously demonstrate the selective value of that care. I experimentally investigated the influence of maternal attendance on survival of eggs in the long-tailed skink, Mabuya longicaudata, on Orchid Island, Taiwan, by placing sympatric reptiles, both predators and nonpredators, into nests. Without maternal care, most lizard eggs were eaten by the egg-eating snake, Oligodon formosanus. Female lizards with eggs attacked snakes more often and escaped from snakes less often than did females without eggs. Survival of eggs was lower when females were removed from clutches than when they were left in attendance. All egg loss in unprotected nests on Orchid Island was due to predation by O. formosanus. Size of snakes did not determine whether lizards abandoned egg-free nests or nests with eggs when attacked. Females that attacked egg predators had larger clutches than those that did not attack. Females recognized sympatric lizards and did not attack species that do not prey on eggs or on M. longicaudata, but recognized the predatory snake Elaphe carinata and escaped when that species entered the nest. These findings emphasize the ecological importance of an increased understanding of the function of parental care in reptiles.

AB Intraspecific nest parasitism may have few costs to hosts in species with precocial young and limited parental care. We examined costs and benefits of parasitism to hosts and parasites in wood ducks, Aix sponsa. Hosts laid fewer eggs when parasitized, although host egg laying was not related to the number of parasite eggs in a nest. The proportion of eggs that hatched declined with increasing clutch size; most unhatched eggs were laid by parasites. Hatching success of host eggs was not affected by parasitism. Incubation length also increased with clutch size, which prolonged nest exposure to predators, although simulations predicted that this was offset by dilution of predation risk. However, longer incubation potentially posed energetic costs. For a wide range of parasitism levels, this energetic cost was low compared to the costs of laying a replacement clutch. Therefore, abandonment was favourable only when nests were heavily parasitized early in the laying period, which was consistent with observations. Inclusive fitness benefits were possible for hosts if hosts and parasites were related. Modelling costs and benefits from the parasite's perspective, the cost of lower hatching success was more than offset by the benefits of avoiding incubation. For females that incubated a nest and parasitized another female's nest, allocation of eggs between nests was influenced by the cost of incubating an additional egg, the cost of lower hatching success of parasitically laid eggs, and any dilution of predation risk for parasitically laid eggs. These findings help to explain the high prevalence of intraspecific nest parasitism in precocial birds. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Individual body odour is known to provide information to conspecifics about both the identity of the donor and its biological state (e.g. reproductive condition, age, diet). It is not clear whether information related to individuality and biological state is evaluated collectively or separately. To gain insight into this subject, we examined the effect of a change in diet on conspecific recognition of individual chemical signatures in mound-building mice, Mus spicilegus. The diet change consisted of the addition of an aromatic concentrate to the drinking water. We used two different procedures based on spontaneous responses of mice to the presentation of odorous stimuli: the habituation-dishabituation procedure and the habituation-generalization procedure. Mice of both sexes were able to perceive the two types of information contained in the modified chemical signature of the donor, that is, they were able both to perceive the change in diet and to identify the chemical signature of the donor.

AB Selection favours females that attend to reliable information about male health or genetic quality. Male nutritional state can be an important indicator of mate quality since poor nutrition can be related to reduced sperm quality, low sperm quantity and sexually transmitted diseases. Here we show that female swordtail fish, Xiphophorus birchmanni, preferred the chemical cues of males that were well fed over those that had been food deprived. However, focal females did not discriminate among the odour of other females with respect to nutritional state, suggesting that they were responding to a sex-specific chemical cue, not simply to food excretions. It is therefore likely that nutritional condition is related to the production of sexual pheromones in males. Our results suggest that chemical cues convey information about male nutritional state, and that females attend to these cues during mate choice. By doing so, females are able to discriminate among males that may differ in important aspects of quality. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   FORMICIDAE; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; POLYGYNY; SEX; AGE
AB Reproductive conflicts are particularly intense in queenless ants because colonies are made up of totipotent workers, all potentially able to mate and produce female offspring. After a gamergate (a mated egg-laying worker) dies, aggressive interactions determine her replacement. In Diacamma, the single gamergate systematically mutilates newly emerged workers (callows) and consequently they can never mate. New callows are expected to resist because, once mutilated, they cannot replace the gamergate. In D. ceylonense and D. australe, we studied the behaviour of new callows confronted with dominant individuals of different fertility or age. Faced with a young unmutilated worker (the future gamergate with poorly developed ovaries), callows were aggressive, whereas they did not resist gamergates. We interpret this dichotomy in terms of reproductive differentials between actors and victims. We discuss the selective advantages of mutilation relative to dominance hierarchies which other queenless ants use to regulate monogyny. Mutilation seems to maximize colony productivity by creating irreversibly sterile helpers from newly emerged individuals.

TI Are two heads better than one? Responses of the duetting kokako to one-
   and two-speaker playback
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SONG; DEFENSE; WREN
AB Duets may serve a variety of functions, including the defence of both territories and pair bonds. In species with antiphonal duets, single birds could theoretically perform songs structurally identical to those of pairs. How, then, could receivers detect whether song comes from a pair or an unpaired bird, and what would be the competitive advantage of duetting if two birds were not necessary to produce full song? We investigated whether an antiphonally duetting species, the kokako, Callaeas cinereus wilsoni (previously Callaeas cinerea wilsoni) distinguishes pairs from unpaired birds by detecting two spatially separated sources of sound. We predicted that simulated duets would represent greater territorial threats than simulated solo songs, and would therefore elicit stronger aggressive responses. We presented kokako with playback of themes sung entirely by one singer, with (1) all theme phrases broadcast from one speaker and (2) theme phrases split (in a way natural for kokako duets) between two speakers placed 10 m apart. Kokako responded differently to one- and two-speaker playbacks. Pairs perceived the simulated duet as the greater territorial threat, as shown by their faster approaches to two-speaker playback. Pairs also matched (responded to a playback phrase by singing the same phrase type) and anticipated (sang a phrase type immediately before it was broadcast by the playback) more often during two-speaker playbacks. We examined pair proximity during playbacks to determine whether simulated duets were perceived as a stronger threat to the pair bond than solo song, and found no support for this second hypothesis.

AB Females involved in extrapair mating are generally thought to obtain indirect benefits through increased offspring quality. We investigated this in the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, a socially monogamous passerine in which females seem to have a preference for elaborately ornamented, high-quality males, both as social and extrapair mating partners. In this species, a variety of parasites and pathogens can potentially infect individuals, both during the nestling stage and later in life. The ability to cope with infections and hence the quality of the immune system may therefore have immediate survival or future fitness consequences. To evaluate whether females engage in extrapair mating to increase offspring cell-mediated immunity, a pivotal component of the avian immune system, we experimentally challenged nestling immunity. Body condition, rearing environment and gender affected the ability of nestlings to mount an immune response. Contrary to a prediction derived from the 'genetic quality' hypothesis, our results revealed no enhanced cell-mediated immune responsiveness in extrapair young compared to their maternal half-siblings reared in the same brood. Female barn swallows therefore do not seem to mate with multiple males in order to increase nestling cell-mediated immunity. Although we cannot reject the possibility that extrapair mating is beneficial to female barn swallows, our results offer no support to the hypothesis that females obtain genetic benefits through extrapair fertilizations.

AB In most communication systems, animals avoid jamming when similar signals from two individuals might overlap and cause interference. Most species of wave-type electric fish avoid jamming by shifting their electric organ discharge (EOD) frequencies away from those of conspecifics or away from mimics of sine wave EOD frequencies presented in playback experiments. Both male and female brown ghosts, however, appear to intentionally jam rivals during competitive interactions if the rival has a higher EOD frequency. We studied this behaviour in competitive interactions between two fish in a neutral arena, and in playback studies with single fish in resident-intruder and neutral arena models. During competitive interactions, females jammed the rival's EOD signal only when the rival's EOD frequency was within similar to 30 Hz of their own EOD frequency, whereas males tried to jam EOD signals of rivals that were 70 Hz higher than their own EOD frequency. In the resident-intruder model experiment, fish tended to raise their EOD frequencies to within potential jamming range in response to a simulated intruder with a higher EOD frequency than their own. In a neutral arena model, fish directed the most aggressive attacks in response to simulated rivals with lower EOD frequencies, yet were less likely to attack the playback device if it played a frequency elevation that mimicked a fish with a lower EOD frequency attempting to jam them. This is the first evidence that electric fish may actively use jamming as an aggressive behaviour. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Models for the evolution of female mating preferences suggest that preferred male traits may be condition dependent. In the field cricket, Gryllus integer, a preferred male trait (calling-bout duration) shows high additive genetic variance. I found that this preferred trait is also condition dependent. Under food deprivation, males lose body mass and correspondingly shorten the durations of their calling bouts. This result implies that females might be able to gain cues from calling-bout durations about a male's body condition.

AB A crucial assumption in models of ecological speciation is that reproductive barriers evolve as a consequence of ecological divergence of populations, rather than geographical separation. To test the prediction that barriers between populations might evolve in the face of gene flow, we studied reproductive barriers between populations of two Swedish ecotypes of the marine snail Littorina saxatilis with inherited differences in shell size and shape, living in adjacent rocky shore microhabitats with zones of overlap making gene flow between ecotypes possible. We compared mounting frequency and duration between mates of different ecotypes with that between mates of the same ecotype but from populations at various geographical distances. (In this species gene flow is substantially reduced over distances of a few kilometres owing to poor dispersal.) Mates of the same ecotype mated more frequently and for longer than mates of different ecotypes, whereas increased geographical distance did not affect this pattern. Snails of similar sizes more frequently initiated copulation than did snails of different sizes, whereas the duration of copulation was affected by shape. Mating between mates of similar sizes but of different ecotype was more frequently interrupted than mating between the same ecotype. Thus ecological rather than geographical separation in this species has resulted in the evolution of local reproductive barriers. This lends support to models of ecological speciation.

AB Group displays involving vocal choruses are a prominent feature of many avian cooperative-breeding systems. The existence of group-specific vocal signatures within these choruses could assist territory owners when assessing the threat posed by different intruding groups. To investigate the possible presence of such signatures, I examined the choruses ('rallies') given by 22 green woodhoopoe, Phoeniculus purpureus, groups over two consecutive seasons. A rally involved the combined cackling of adult group members. Statistical, analysis of midrally vocalizations, when all group members were calling, revealed that samples from the same group clustered in principal coordinate space, and the group clusters segregated from each other to a significant degree. This segregation might theoretically arise from differences in group size and sex ratio, especially since the vocalizations are sexually dimorphic. However, groups containing the same numbers of males and females had rallies that were significantly different acoustically. Groups that maintained the same composition of individuals produced acoustically similar rallies across seasons, while those that changed membership produced significantly different rallies. The group signature is therefore most likely to result from group members producing their own individual vocal programmes, but participating in a similar way for every rally. In a playback experiment, groups responded significantly more rapidly to strangers and to neighbours on the wrong boundary than to neighbours in their expected place. Woodhoopoes therefore appeared capable of distinguishing between groups on the basis of their vocal signatures, representing the first evidence of the 'dear-enemy' phenomenon in a group-living species.

AB The rosy wolfsnail, Euglandina rosea, is a predatory snail native to the southeastern United States. It eats other snails and slugs, tracking them by following their mucus trails. Although wolfsnails follow mucus trails of both prey and conspecifics, they rarely eat conspecifics, and only conspecific trails are followed directionally. We investigated how wolfsnails distinguish conspecifics from prey snails (Helix aspersa) and how they determine directionality of conspecific mucus trails. We found that wolfsnails used chemical cues present in mucus to distinguish conspecifics from prey, and were less likely to attack a snail covered with wolfsnail mucus than one covered with prey mucus (experiment 1). juvenile wolfsnails that were isolated from conspecifics before hatching recognized conspecifics as nonprey (experiment 2), and adult wolfsnails learned to follow trails of novel substances associated with exposure to other wolfsnails (experiment 3). Wolfsnails were equally attracted to both soluble and insoluble components of conspecific mucus (experiment 4) and followed conspecific mucus trails directionality even after the trails had been washed (experiment 5). We also examined whether a structural or chemical asymmetry in conspecific mucus allowed wolfsnails to determine directionality of conspecific trails. Although results of scanning electron microscopy provided no support for directionality using a structural asymmetry, manipulations of wolfsnail trails (experiments 6, 7) indicated that wolfsnails use a right/left chemical asymmetry in mucus trails to orient themselves on conspecific trails in the same direction as the trail-layer snail, independent of the trail layer's direction of movement. 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In vertebrates, the mating preferences of individual females can be flexible and the probability of a female mating with a particular male can be significantly increased by her having previously observed another conspecific female affiliate and mate with that same male. In theory, such mate-choice-copying behaviour has potentially important consequences for both the genetic and social ('cultural') transmission of female mating preferences. For copying to result in the 'cultural inheritance' of mating preferences, individual females must not only copy the mate choice decisions of other females but they also should tend to repeat this type of behaviour (i.e. make similar mating decisions) subsequently and to generalize their socially induced preference for a particular male to other males that share his distinctive characteristics. Here, we show experimentally that individual female guppies, Poecilia reticulata, not only copy the observed mating preferences of other females for particular males, but that the preference now assumed via copying is subsequently repeated and generalized to other males of a similar colour phenotype. These results provide empirical evidence for social enhancement of female preference for particular phenotypic traits of chosen males rather than for the particular males possessing those traits, and thus have important implications for our understanding of the role of social learning in the evolution of female mating preferences and of male epigamic traits.

AB Chemical communication plays a major role in mammalian behaviour. One mammal with well-developed chemical senses is the grey short-tailed opossum, a small, South American marsupial that has become common in laboratory research. Male and female opossums scent-mark with different body parts, but apparently not with urine, and females enter oestrus following their exposure to male odours. To elucidate the effects of body odours on the behaviour of female opossums, we investigated their ability to discriminate between conspecific odours originating from different body parts. We simultaneously presented female opossums with two cotton balls smeared either with skin and glandular secretions or urine of conspecifics, or with distilled water or blank controls, and we analysed the time females spent investigating each stimulus. Odours of the male suprasternal gland elicited intensive investigation by the test females. Male flank and submandible odours, and female submandible odours, were also attractive to the females. Investigation of male and female urine was comparable to investigation of water and blank controls. We suggest that in this species, which inhabits semiarid areas, urine marking is avoided to reduce dehydration, and consequently urine has lost its biological significance as a chemosignal. On the other hand, glandular and skin secretions, which are more stable than aqueous deposits in dry conditions, allow the opossums to communicate with each other effectively and also to retain body fluids.

AB Recent theory and empirical evidence suggest a role for sexual conflict in the evolution of male ejaculates, including 'nuptial gifts'. According to the sexual conflict hypothesis, the greater the probability of female remating, the stronger the selection on males to induce an elevated reproductive rate in their mates, even if this reduces some components of female fitness, such as survivorship. Piophilid flies show an unusual form of nuptial gift: following copulation, females expel and ingest much of the sperm and accessory fluids received from the male. We investigated the effects of ejaculate ingestion on female fitness in the piophilid carrion fly Prochyliza xanthostonia by manipulating females' opportunity to ingest the ejaculate under two background food levels (fed ad libitum versus starved). We also estimated females' probability of remating Few P. xanthostoma females mated more than once in repeated pairings with males. Females permitted to ingest the ejaculate oviposited sooner and laid more eggs than females prevented from ingesting the ejaculate, but ejaculate ingestion did not affect female survival. Hence, ejaculate feeding appeared to increase females' net fitness. However, these effects were evident only in fed females, suggesting that ejaculate meals provide mainly stimulation rather than nutrition. The benign effects of ejaculate feeding on female fitness, and the lack of evidence of sexual conflict, are consistent with the low female remating rate in this species. None the less, our results suggest that sexual conflict has played a role in the evolution of these traits.

AB Testosterone (T) is generally regarded as a proximate mediator of avian male trade-offs between mating effort and parental effort, based partly on findings that exogenous T reduces male parental provisioning of nestlings in many passerines. We examined whether T has similarly disruptive effects on male incubation behaviour. We observed behaviour of male house sparrows, Passer domesticus, that were experimentally maintained at high T levels during incubation; we also compared the responses of the males' social mates to deficiencies in the incubation and nestling provisioning contributions of their partners. During the incubation stage of the nesting cycle, T-males spent less than half as much time incubating as control males; in lieu of incubating, T-males engaged in advertisement calling and aggressive interactions more frequently, and were away from the nest more often, than control males. We detected no significant effect of T on male rates of sexual interaction or contributions of nesting material, however. As expected, T-males also provisioned nestlings at lower rates than control males. In turn, females paired to T-males significantly increased their own contributions to incubation, but did not compensate for their mates' reductions in nestling provisioning. These results show that suppressive effects of T on male parental care generalize to incubation behaviour in this species and reinforce the view of T as a mediator of trade-offs between parental and mating effort. In addition, they demonstrate that the existence of any adjustments of parental effort in response to partner contributions can hinge on the form of parental care considered.

AB The common cuttlefish is an opportunistic predator with certain prey preferences. The literature suggests that learning plays a role in the predatory behaviour of cuttlefish. However, nothing is known about taste aversion learning in cephalopods. We developed a learning procedure in which the preferred prey of the experimental cuttlefish was made distasteful by a bitter taste (quinine). In the training session, the modified prey was repeatedly presented until the experimental cuttlefish stopped attacking it. Of 32 experimental cuttlefish, 26 attacked a different prey from the originally preferred one when both were presented in a choice test 24 or 72 h after learning. In contrast, matched control cuttlefish that had not been subjected to negative reinforcement continued to choose the initially preferred prey under identical test conditions. These results are the first demonstration of taste aversion learning in cephalopods. They underline essential adaptive functions in cuttlefish and the flexibility of their feeding behaviour. Cuttlefish were able to learn that a prey is not acceptable food, even if they usually preyed on it, to recognize it and to avoid it for several days and as a result to eat a usually nonpreferred prey.

AB The propensity of males to behave territorially may be greatly affected by the perceived quality of the habitat. In suboptimal habitats, the cost of defence may be prohibitively large compared to the associated benefits, and territorial behaviour may be expected to decline. We tested this hypothesis in a population of black-capped chickadees breeding in adjacent habitats: one habitat consisted of an 85-ha patch of early seral forests regenerating after clear-cut logging (disturbed site), and the other consisted of an 85-ha patch of mature mixed-wood forests (undisturbed site). Breeding success of pairs in the disturbed site was significantly lower than in the undisturbed site, suggesting a difference in the relative quality of the two habitats. During the spring of 2000 and 2001, we mapped the actively defended areas and song posts of colour-marked chickadees and found that pairs occupying the disturbed site were subject to more territorial intrusions than pairs in the undisturbed mature woodlands. Five pairs of chickadees in the disturbed habitat and five pairs in the undisturbed habitat were radiotagged and we conducted repeated focal observations on the movement patterns of the birds. All five pairs in the disturbed habitat regularly intruded into areas actively defended by neighbouring birds; only one of the five pairs in the undisturbed habitat ever intruded onto the known territory of another pair during an observation period. Our results suggest that the quality of the disturbed habitat may have been sufficiently low so as to make normal levels of exclusive defence cost inefficient. Conversely, birds in disturbed habitat may have intruded more frequently into neighbouring territories because resource levels in their own exclusively defended territory were insufficient to meet energetic requirements during the breeding season.

AB We tested predictions of evolutionary game theory focusing on fight duration and intensity during contests between European fallow deer, Dama dama L. We examined the relation between contest duration and intensity and resource-holding potential (RHP; body weight and antler size), in an effort to reveal the assessment rules used by competing males. We examined other potential determinants of duration and intensity: resource value (the oestrous female) and experience of agonistic interactions. Asymmetry in body weight or antler length of contestants was not correlated with fight duration. Body weight and antler length of the fight winner or loser were also not correlated with fight duration. Neither were the body weight of the heavier or lighter animal or the antler length of the animal that had longer or shorter antlers. A measure of intensity (the jump clash) was positively related to the body weight of the losing animal and the lighter member of the dyad. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that opponents escalate contest intensity based on assessment of their own ability rather than through mutual assessment. There was no evidence that resource value is an important factor in either fight duration or intensity in this population. As the number of fights between pairs of males increased, there was a decrease in fight duration. Fights were longer when at least one member of a competing pair of males had previously experienced a victory. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Animals can acquire a global knowledge about their environment that exceeds their individual capacities by estimating the local density and activity of nestmates in an area. In ants, home range marking can indicate the density and activity of nestmates, allowing scouts to assess the potential interest of the area as a foraging site. We investigated how home range marking through footprints influences the foraging behaviour of Lasius niger scouts at a sugary food source (1 M, 1.5 ml). Over a marked apparatus the discovery time of food sources decreased while the probability of scouts recruiting nestmates and of continuing to lay a trail increased. For ants making U turns on their return to the nest, home range marking helped them to resume laying a trail after the U turn and delayed the occurrence of the U turn. As a result, the trail intensity and the rate at which information about food was conveyed by scouts to nestmates depended on home range marking. Such modulation of information reduces the number of foragers mobilized to less frequented areas that are potentially dangerous and promotes recruitment and exploitation of food sources to better known sites.

AB Studies on vertebrate species in which the offspring obtain food only from their parents have shown that offspring begging conveys information on offspring hunger. It is unclear whether begging can also convey information on hunger in partially begging species, in which the offspring, from hatching, obtain food partly through begging for food from the parents and partly through self-feeding. In partially begging species, offspring hunger state could reflect the amount of food obtained by self-feeding in addition to the amount obtained from the parent, and the offspring could respond to hunger by self-feeding instead of begging. To test whether begging reflected the current hunger state of offspring in the partially begging beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, we subjected larvae to two deprivation treatments: no access to any food for 2 h (i.e. food-deprived larvae) and no food provided by the parent (i.e. self-feeding larvae). Larvae of both treatments spent more time begging than did control larvae, which had access to food both from the parents and by self-feeding. Furthermore, the amount of begging differed between the treatments, with food-deprived larvae spending more time begging than the self-feeding ones. We conclude that, in partially begging species, food obtained through both foraging strategies, i.e. begging for food from parents and self-feeding, contribute to the offspring's current hunger state, and that begging can convey information about it.

AB We studied homing behaviour of leaf-cutter bees, Megachile rotundata, by using artificial landmarks. We evaluated their nest-searching behaviour in different test situations to elucidate the nature of the visual marks they used in this task. When we modified or removed geometrical figures surrounding the nest, the bees searched for longer, showing that they noticed the introduced changes. However, these manipulations never prevented bees from finding their nest, suggesting that other visual cues were crucial in the task. Manipulations of the edges provided by the boundaries of the device (nest block, metal sheet on which the block was mounted) strongly impaired the homing performance. The further away the edges that were left intact, the stronger was the impairment of the homing behaviour. These results suggest that bees learn the distances of the various edges from the goal and that edges have a hierarchical significance according to their distance from the nest. The most distant edges provide vague information, which suffices to guide the insect towards the next edge in the sequence, until it recognizes the final, precise location of the nest. The results support the conclusion that information on distances is acquired using cues derived from motion parallax generated by the insect's self-motion. Recognition of edge parameters such as position and orientation might be achieved by an image-matching mechanism based on dynamic processes. Thus, in the homing task, there is no clear discrepancy between the eidetic and the parametric hypotheses of spatial representation. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In group-living species, theoretical considerations indicate the existence of a fundamental conflict of interest between the sexes over the adult sex ratio within groups. Females may derive certain benefits from living with many males. Males, in contrast, should generally try to monopolize access to a group of females. Which sex ultimately controls adult group sex ratio is poorly known. We examined this conflict between the sexes in redfronted lemurs, Malagasy primates characterized by an unusual lack of female-biased adult sex ratios. Using various demographic and behavioural data from several groups collected over 6 years, we examined (1) the proximate determinants of this unusual sex ratio, (2) the temporal distribution of female fertile phases within groups as a determinant of male monopolization potential, (3) sources of between-group variation in the adult sex ratio, and (4) possible social benefits of the relatively high number of males for both sexes. Birth and mortality rates were not sex biased and males migrated considerably more frequently than females, providing no proximate explanation for the unusual sex ratio. However, certain life history traits (fast maturation, short interbirth intervals) may ultimately play a role because they act to facilitate joint group transfers of male coalitions. Despite a relatively small female group size and an associated high monopolization potential, female oestrous synchrony may prevent the formation of single-male groups. Reduced male group size seems to be the main predictor of take-over rate, and, thus, infanticide risk, suggesting that both sexes may benefit from the high number of coresident males, thereby considerably defusing the conflict of interest between the sexes.

AB Animals tend to respond more strongly to signals that are more colourful and such signals are also common in nature. This is the first study to explore experimentally the possibility that response biases arising in an animal's recognition mechanisms can explain these findings. We trained domestic fowls, Gallus gallus domesticus, to respond by pecking or not pecking to different colours displayed on a touch-sensitive computer screen. The colours changed in response to the birds' choices, which mimicked a simple evolutionary process. Discrimination training generated response biases for the colours more distinct from the nonrewarding colour. As a result the signals evolved towards distinct coloration. The biases developed in directions towards more intense and towards less intense colour, depending on the colour of the nonrewarding stimulus. The result may be applicable to all sorts of visual signals encountered during the same kind of experiences, that is, when one signal should be avoided and another should be approached.

AB In eusocial Hymenoptera, worker reproduction is affected by various factors, especially the genetic structure of the colony. Kinship theory predicts that hymenopteran workers prefer to produce sons rather than brothers when a single, once-mated queen is in a colony, while such worker reproduction is expected to be mutually inhibited by other workers under multiple mating of the queen. To test these predictions we observed the behaviour of the myrmicine ant Aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica. Observation of the social structure of 60 queenright colonies indicated monogyny and microsatellite DNA analysis of 14 colonies showed monandry. Under laboratory conditions, workers with functional ovaries laid only trophic eggs in the presence of the queen and produced viable eggs in her absence. In an experiment in which colonies split and reunited, workers that had well-developed ovarioles with viable oocytes were frequently attacked by other workers from the queenright groups. The number of cocytes in a worker's ovarioles was positively correlated with the frequency of being attacked. The results show that a worker's production of males in this species is potentially inhibited by worker policing, contrary to the prediction that worker policing is not predominant in monogynous and monandrous societies.

AB Filial cannibalism has been described in many fish species with male parental care, and has typically been explained as a response to high energetic costs of brood defence and decreased feeding opportunities during the period of care. We investigated filial cannibalism in an insect, the assassin bug Rhinocoris tristis. In this species, males guard eggs of a number of females, cannibalizing some of their offspring within the brood. We monitored guarding males in both the field and the laboratory. Males typically ate eggs around the periphery of the brood, which were those most likely to have been parasitized by wasps. However, cannibalism persisted in the laboratory in the absence of parasites, and the number of cannibalized eggs was related to the length of care and overall brood size, suggesting that males use eggs as an alternative source of food. This conclusion was further supported by the fact that males in the field did not lose weight while guarding, despite being unable to forage efficiently while caring. Males were also observed to adopt broods, but in a laboratory experiment did not eat more eggs from adopted than from their own broods.

AB Birdsong functions as both a territorial and a mate-attracting signal, and is therefore subject to inter- and intrasexual selection through male-male competition and female mate choice. Consequently, differences in song perception between males and females could potentially lead to conflicting selection pressures on song structure. Chaffinch, Fringilla coelebs, songs have two distinctive parts: a series of rapidly repeated notes (the trill) followed by a sequence of more complex and often nonrepeated elements (the flourish). Males often spontaneously sing incomplete songs consisting mainly of the trill part, but their communicative function is unclear. We tested the reaction of males to songs with and without the terminal flourish in a dual speaker playback design by measuring their approach to the speakers. Like female chaffinches tested with the same stimuli in a previous study, males responded more to songs with both trill and flourish than to those consisting of a trill only. However, although females had preferred songs with a relatively longer flourish, males showed the strongest reaction (closest approach to the speaker) to songs with longer trills and shorter flourishes. The results suggest that males and females may perceive aspects of chaffinch song structure differently, in which case it could be under conflicting pressure of intra- and intersexual selection.

AB The capacity to learn enables animals to match their phenotypic response to a changing environment on the basis of experience but learning is likely to incur costs such as the cost of making mistakes or the energetic cost of processing information. Little is known about how animals optimize the use of learned behaviour within their natural environments such that potential costs are minimized. We investigated whether the use of local landmarks in learning orientation routes by the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, varied in response to the visual stability of their natural habitats. Sticklebacks collected from five fast-flowing rivers and five ponds were trained to locate a hidden reward in a T-maze. Locating the reward required the fish to learn a body-centred algorithmic behaviour (turn left or right) or to follow plant landmarks. Probe trials, in which these cues conflicted, revealed which spatial cue the fish was using. Pond fish appeared to rely more than river fish on visual landmarks, which is consistent with the suggestion that even within a species, learned behaviour is fine-tuned in response to local environmental conditions. Landmarks may be reliable indicators of location only in stable pond habitats. In rivers, turbulence and flow may continually disrupt the visual landscape such that river fish may benefit from learning orientation routes only if learning is constrained so that unreliable visual cues are ignored.

AB We investigated postfledging parental care in a philopatric population of Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, breeding on Kent Island, New Brunswick, Canada in an effort to understand the factors influencing adult birds' decisions about parental investment in offspring. Brood division was not based on offspring sex: male and female parents were equally likely to care for sons or daughters. The total duration of parental care, from hatching to independence, was similar for sons and daughters (median=23 days), regardless of the sex of the care-giving parent. The duration of parental care also corresponded closely to the time required for juveniles to acquire basic foraging skills. Despite high levels of extrapair paternity, male Savannah sparrows invested as much in postfledging care and were as effective as females in caring for fledglings, based on recruitment of fledglings into the breeding population the following year. Male parents were more likely to care for smaller fledglings and for offspring from early broods (presumably to enable females to dedicate their efforts towards second clutches). Caring for fledglings was costly for parents: survivorship decreased as a function of the duration of postfledging parental care and the number of fledglings cared for. Parental survivorship, however, was not affected by the sex of the fledglings cared for. This study suggests that sex-biased provisioning may be unlikely except in species with strongly sexually dimorphic offspring, biased offspring sex ratios and sex-biased natal dispersal.

AB Discrete alternative reproductive phenotypes are probably often due to individuals adopting alternative tactics with unequal fitnesses in conditional strategies with status-dependent selection. One tactic is believed to be favoured below a status switch point and another tactic above it, owing to different fitness functions of the tactics. Males of the European earwig are dimorphic. Macrolabic males are large (high status) and have long forceps, and brachylabic males are small (low status) with short forceps. I tested whether fitness functions, measured as mating success, of the two morphs differed with regard to forceps length and body weight. Macrolabic in-ales with longer forceps than a competing male had higher mating success but brachylabic males benefited by being heavier than their competitor. Thus, different selection regimes were acting on the two morphs, suggesting that their fitness functions differed in relation to status. These observations and those of previous studies, showing that morph expression is environmentally determined and is associated with body size and that the morphs have unequal fitness, provide support for the hypothesis that male dimorphism in this species is a conditional strategy that has evolved under status-dependent selection. The differential investment in forceps growth that characterizes the morphs was manifested in a steeper allometric relation between forceps length and body size in macrolabic than brachylabic males. Behavioural observations showed that males of both morphs engaged in direct contests for females. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In general, animals prefer to mate with individuals they have observed being courted or in close association with sexual partners. This phenomenon of mate copying has been, demonstrated in several species, but so far no study has provided substantial evidence that it is adaptive. Furthermore, mate copying has been viewed only in the context of females copying other females or males copying other males. In the peacock blenny, Salaria pavo, parasitic males (sneakers) may gain an advantage by copying the association patterns of females with bourgeois males (large males that defend nests). We tested the sneaker's preference for one. of two males and subsequently presented the nonpreferred male to the sneaker in the company of females, while the preferred male was presented alone. If the association of females with bourgeois males influences the sneaker's preference, we predicted the sneaker would spend more time close to the nonpreferred male, when females were no longer present. We found that (1) sneakers preferred to associate with the larger of the two, males and (2) when the previously nonpreferred male was presented in the company of females the sneakers tended to approach that male sooner, although not significantly so, and to spend more time close to it. Thus, parasitic males seem to choose host males both by independent mechanisms (larger males were preferred) and by nonindependent mechanisms (males observed with females were preferred). We discuss the adaptive value of sneakers choosing males by each of these mechanisms. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB When social constraints on the expression of mate preferences are absent, variation in offspring viability is predicted to favour females and males that display mate preferences. Earlier studies showed that female and male house mice, Mug domesticus, tested individually and mated with preferred (P) partners had higher reproductive success and better progeny performance than individuals mated with nonpreferred (NP) partners. Here we tested the effects of mutual mate preferences on reproductive success, offspring viability and performance. We conducted mate preference tests and created four types of reproductive pairings. One involved females and males that preferred each other (P-P); the second type had females that preferred the male but the male did not prefer the female (P-NP); the third had females that did not prefer the male but the male did prefer the female (NP-P). The last set consisted of females and males that did not prefer each other (NP-NP). We measured components of fitness for breeders (reproductive success) and offspring viability (birth-to-weaning viability and weight variation) as well as measures of offspring performance. There were no statistical differences in reproductive success of breeders or offspring viability and quality (weight variation) among the four types of pairings. There were, however, consistent differences between P-P versus NP-NP matings. The number of pups weaned, time to first litter, birth-to-weaning viability, pup body weight at birth and weaning, and the growth rates for pups of both sexes were consistently greater for progeny from P-P matings than NP-NP matings. Significant differences occurred among the four mating types in dominance of sons during aggression trials, nest construction and predator avoidance. Progeny from P-P matings displayed behaviour associated with higher fitness more often than progeny from NP-NP matings. These data show that breeders produce more highly competent progeny, most likely to survive, when social constraints on the expression of mate preferences in both sexes are relaxed.

AB We examined the effects of parental experience and group size on infant care and development. Ten cottontop tamarin families were followed across three consecutive births of offspring to examine differences in survival, quality of care, developmental maturation and physical development for infants in two experimental conditions: (1) in large groups with previous parenting experience and (2) in small groups with little or no parenting experience. Although we found no differences in infant mortality, parents treated infants differently between conditions. However, when we examined the cumulative care provided by parents and sibling helpers together across experimental conditions, there were no differences in the rates of retrieval or rejection of infants. Overall levels of infant transport and food transfers were similar between conditions, with fathers and sibling helpers contributing the bulk of care. Fathers in small groups carried infants and transferred food with infants much more than helpers but, as group size increased, helpers augmented this role. Infant development varied with the experience of the family both between conditions and within a family. The results indicate that infants receive similar levels of care regardless of group size and parenting experience, although the individual contributions of family members change with both factors. Parental experience with previous infants had effects on early infant development, but only for the first sets of infants. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB How much an animal invests in defending a territory depends, in part, on the quality, quantity and distribution of resources, but do animals target their investment in defence within the territory according to the location of different resources? We examined whether wild-caught male and female house mice increased aggression towards intruders of the same or opposite sex when in areas containing their food/water or nest site. Pairs of resident mice were established in enclosures consisting of two areas. In split enclosures, food and water were in one area and a nest site in the other, while in clumped enclosures all resources were in one area with no resources in the other. Residents of both sexes were quicker to attack intruders, and were more aggressive, in areas containing resources than in an area containing no resources. There was no difference in aggression between areas containing food/water, a nest site or both. The effect of resources on territorial defence was due largely to changes in aggression against intruders of the opposite sex. Residents, especially males, attacked intruders of their own sex more than those of the opposite sex. This bias was much stronger when no resources were present, owing to low aggression against opposite-sex intruders in the absence of resources. There were no differences in intruder aggression, and the relative size of the intruder (heavier or lighter than the resident) had no effect on resident aggression. Residents also spent less time out of their nest in clumped enclosures owing to low activity in the nonresource area. 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals may be able to assess the quality of other individuals by using information contained in single or multiple traits. We investigated the honesty of the information potentially conveyed through different elements of the tail of the black-billed magpie, Pica pica, which develops in a similar way in both sexes while still in the nest. Variability and age and sex dimorphism were all higher for tail features than for other morphological characters. Tail length of first-year males and females was negatively correlated with the number of feathers with fault bars, which may reflect stressful environmental conditions during feather growth in the nest. Adult males may indicate current body condition through overall tail expression, while the current condition of adult females may be signalled by indicators of stressful environmental conditions during feather growth in the previous year, although both these correlations were weak. Tail length correlated negatively with testes volume of first years, and tails tended to be less damaged in both first-year and adult males with large testes. First-year males that had reached sexual maturity had shorter tails than those that had not. There was no association between parasitism and tail expression, but tail length was positively related to spleen size in first-year males. This study provides evidence that multiple information about individual quality may be conveyed by different features of the tail in ways that vary in different age and sex classes.

AB Complex bidirectional interactions between host social behaviour and infectious organisms (parasites) can be mediated by alterations in host glucocorticoid 'stress' hormones. As a result, an animal's social behaviour may affect its susceptibility to parasitism, and its infection status may influence its social behaviour. Our field study of behaviour, hormones and parasites in free-living juvenile male black iguanas revealed a pattern of significantly lower levels of the primary reptilian glucocorticoid, corticosterone (B), in lizards infected with either ticks or blood parasites than in uninfected lizards. To clarify both the mechanisms underpinning this association and the interaction of social behaviour with B and parasites, we conducted an experimental study in which lizards were stocked singly in field enclosures in one of the following four treatments: (1) unmanipulated; (2) implanted with B; (3) implanted with saline; and (4) exposed to a conspecific intruder. We sampled B and blood parasite levels periodically over the course of 4 weeks for each treatment. Lizards that were infected with blood parasites on the day of capture showed a significant increase in B after captivity in the enclosures, whereas uninfected lizards showed no such response. Lizards that were exposed to conspecific intruders showed a significant increase in B relative to controls, and residents that engaged in low levels of aggression showed significantly higher levels of B than residents that engaged in high levels of aggression. However, none of the experimental treatments affected the likelihood of acquiring a new blood parasite infection. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study ofAnimal Behaviour.

TI A state-free optimization model for sequences of behaviour
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The view of animals as optimizers is extremely important in many parts of biology, and is represented in a variety of theoretical models. Current developments in animal welfare create a need for a new theoretical model, which treats the animal as acting optimally in its choice of a sequence of behaviours, and places as few restrictions as possible on what quantity is being maximized. The intention is to facilitate the study of what the animal chooses, which will often be relevant in considering animal welfare. Currently, economic models of the consumer are borrowed in this situation, but they are not well suited for the increasingly exact analyses being performed. A new alternative model is presented here analytically in general, and a special case is studied numerically. The model does not attribute internal states to the individual, which is a simplification with advantages and disadvantages. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Studies of sexual selection have mostly focused on female choice and male-male competition. However, when a male contributes substantially to a breeding attempt, he would benefit from choosing a female whose reproductive potential is high in order to maximize his reproductive success. We examined male mate choice in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, with respect to experimental manipulation of female fecundity. This was enhanced by a dietary supplement prior to contact with the males. When housed with females of differing fecundity, male zebra finches preferentially direct their courtship towards more fecund females. This outcome could be a consequence of female-female interactions or direct male preference. In this experiment, we gave males a choice between standard and supplemented females in an experimental arena where the females were spatially segregated, and could not interact with each other, thereby excluding the possibility of female-female competition. Males spent significantly more time with the more fecund female, they hopped more times on the perch opposite that female and were twice as likely to choose her than the standard female. The standard females were not, however, unreceptive to males, nor did they appear to differ in their activity patterns in response to the male. These results show that males are able to distinguish females that have higher fecundity, and that this is not the result of relative female competitiveness or dominance status.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID AGGREGATIVE BEHAVIOR; ARANEAE; PREY; ARANEIDAE; SEARCH
AB Although there is some evidence that web-building spiders are more likely to select habitats where conspecifics are present, the mechanisms underlying the attraction to conspecifics remain poorly understood. One hypothesis is that the presence of conspecifics is an indirect signal of good habitat quality. Alternatively, the presence of other webs could improve the structural suitability of the site for the construction of new webs, by increasing the number of anchorage points necessary for web support. We tested these hypotheses in the orb-weaving spider Nephilengys cruentata in a seminatural field situation. We released females inside individual enclosures and recorded where they settled. The enclosures were provided with either (1) small and flat cotton-like fragments of newly built webs from conspecifics or (2) artificial threads attached to their walls, providing additional structural support for the construction of the web. Spiders were significantly more likely to settle inside those cages containing silk from conspecifics than in vacant control enclosures, and the silk was not used for the construction of the web. The presence of artificial threads, in turn, did not increase their probability of settlement. Our results indicate that conspecific attraction in N. cruentata is not only a by-product of direct benefits that existing webs may provide, but can also follow from the use of silk as an indirect predictor of habitat quality.

AB Azure-winged magpies, Cyanopica cyana, breed most successfully when nesting near active nest sites of Japanese lesser sparrowhawks, Accipiter gularis. Magpie nests that contain nestlings after the period when sparrowhawks defend their nests suffer predation and the success of magpie breeding depends greatly upon hawk nest defence. To clarify the relationship between the timing of breeding of these two species, I compared the timing of breeding in azure-winged magpie pairs with variation in the level of nest defence by the hawk (as estimated by the nest success and the rate of nest defence of hawks). The date of onset of incubation in magpies was similar to the date that would have maximized the protection they gained from the hawk. Magpies nesting near hawk nests bred synchronously, but magpies far from them did not. The results suggest that magpies breed according to the hawks' breeding schedule in order to avoid nest predation and increase breeding success.

AB Lycaena hippothoe males show aggressive territorial behaviour. We found the predominant mate location tactic to be perching; however, with increasingly more favourable weather conditions perch phases were ever more frequently interrupted by short patrol flights. In contrast to previous studies we found no switch between perching and patrolling. Rather, each territorial male used a flexible combination of both and the portion of time allocated to each behaviour depended on extrinsic factors. Consequently, territoriality was not given up during patrolling. This strategy seemed to be related to enhanced mating opportunities and relatively large territories (ca. 10-20 m(2)). Territories were located within patches of flowering nectar plants (resource-based territoriality). Other parameters (such as vegetation height, larval host plant density and distance to the nearest bushes) were not important in this context. Defending nectar sources is an uncommon territorial system in butterflies, and its evolution is attributed to the widely dispersed occurrence of receptive females, which concentrate at rich nectar sources. Given the strong dependence of reproductive output on adult resources in L. hippothoe, it is a straightforward strategy for males to monopolize nectar sources in spite of their high investments.

AB We investigated the effect of an environmental perturbation on brown trout, Salmo trutta, dominance hierarchies. Hierarchies were established over a 1-week period under constant simulated natural conditions in artificial stream tanks. In the perturbation treatment water levels were then lowered for a week to simulate a drought, whereas conditions remained the same in the control tanks. We recorded behavioural interactions before and after the environmental perturbation. After the 2-week experiment, we killed the fish and measured growth rate, plasma cortisol, hepatic glycogen content, hepatosomatic index, gill epithelial chloride cell densities and interrenal cell nuclear areas. Aggression showed a nonsignificant increase in the drought tanks when the water level was lowered, and behaviour and social ranking of the fish were significantly affected by the environmental perturbation with a general breakdown in the social hierarchy. The pronounced benefits of dominance in terms of growth rate observed in the control tanks were not apparent in the drought tanks. However, the cortisol concentrations of the drought fish were not significantly higher than those of control fish at the end of the experiment, suggesting that the environmental change itself was not physiologically stressful in the long term. Neither were any other physiological parameters measured significantly different to those of the control tanks. Given that a stable social system land its physiological consequences) was observed only in a constant environment, misleading conclusions may be drawn if environmental perturbations are not incorporated into experiments studying the behaviour of stream-living fish in simulated natural conditions.

AB With the goal of enhancing psychological well-being, we developed an environmental enrichment programme for eight subadult and six adult giant pandas, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, at the Wolong Breeding Center in Sichuan, China. We used five different enrichment items, each selected because of the different behavioural opportunities they promoted: (1) manipulable plastic objects; (2) a burlap sack full of straw; (3) spruce branches; (4) a fruitcicle (apples frozen in a large ice block); and (5) a puzzle feeder. Each subject received each of the five items on three occasions, for a total of 15 enrichment sessions over the course of the 2.5-month study period. Each enrichment session was paired with a control session in which no enrichment was present. Pandas spent significantly more time active, and displayed a greater variety of object- and nonobject-directed behaviours when enrichment was present. We also found a statistically significant reduction in the rate of and percentage of time engaged in the performance of stereotypic behaviour and behaviours indicative of feeding anticipation. This effect was maintained even when pandas were not interacting directly with an enrichment item, suggesting that enrichment had a motivational carry-over effect in the aftermath of interactions with enrichment items. These results are consistent with the ethological needs model of motivation in that opportunities to perform more natural behaviour appeared to improve motivational indices of well-being. The pandas remained responsive to enrichment across the 15 trials, providing no evidence for habituation or cross-habituation, Age proved to be an important determinant of responsiveness; for example, adults, but not subadults, displayed a significant preference for feeding enrichment. Future studies will assess whether these promising initial results are maintained throughout the lives of captive giant pandas. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Among the Paridae, food hoarding is thought to be strongly associated with the exclusive use of territories by winter groups, although it has also been described in populations with loose social systems. However, detailed data on such populations are scarce. To identify the mechanisms underlying individual storing decisions, I studied hoarding behaviour in a nonterritorial, high-density coal tit, Parus ater, population in a subalpine forest. The presence of close neighbours (within 5 m) had the strongest, negative influence on caching probability, whereas more distant neighbours foraging in the same flock did not affect the probability of caching. Adults concentrated their stores in the center of their home ranges. Caching location, but not caching intensity, was affected by the time of day. Coal tits took longer, and travelled further, to cache food in the inner parts of trees than in the outer parts. Resident adults stored in inner, safer caching locations more often than juvenile residents and transients. Differences in hoarding effort according to the storing substrate, and the daily storing location pattern of juvenile residents and transients, suggest that stores have a different use depending on where they are located. Therefore, my results show that hoarding is compatible with a nonterritorial, nonbreeding social system; hoarding could thus have originated in an ancient, nonterritorial, but sedentary, tit species.

AB To investigate the relative importance of paternity defences in the European robin we used behavioural observations, simulated intrusions and temporary male removal experiments. Given that paired males did not increase their mate attendance, copulation rate or territory size during the female's fertile period, the most frequently quoted paternity assurance strategies in birds were absent. However, males with fertile females sang and patrolled their territories more regularly, suggesting that territorial motivation and vigilance were elevated when the risk of cuckoldry was greatest. In addition, there was a significant effect of breeding period on response to simulated intrusions: residents approached and attacked freeze-dried mounts more readily in the fertile period. During 90-min removals of the pair male in the fertile period, neighbours trespassed more frequently relative to prefertile and fertile period controls and appeared to seek copulations with unattended females. When replaced on their territories, males immediately increased both song rate and patrolling rate in comparison with controls. We propose that male robins sing to signal their presence, and increase their territorial vigilance and aggression in the fertile period to protect paternity.

ID CYANEA GRAY; PACIFIC; CEPHALOPODA; BEHAVIOR; DEEP
AB We studied the reproductive behaviour of the blue-ringed octopus, Hapalochlaena lunulata, in the laboratory by examining 15 male-male and nine male-female interactions. The initiation of physical contact was independent of sex, size or residency status, and there were no noticeable changes in behaviour such as sexual displays associated with courtship or aggression prior to contact. Males did not distinguish between females or other males and copulated (defined as the insertion of the hectocotylus into the mantle cavity of another octopus) readily with both. Spermatophores were released in all copulations with females but not with males. The duration of copulation was significantly longer in male-female interactions (median 160.5 min) than in male-male interactions (median 30 s). Although male-male copulations ended passively with the withdrawal of the hectocotylus by the initiating animal, male-female copulations were always terminated by the females following an intense struggle. These studies suggest the inability of male H. lunulata to determine the sexual identity of potential mates prior to the insertion of the hectocotylus and demonstrate the active role of the female during copulation.

AB Owners have often been found to have an advantage in animal contests. One explanation of this is that the resource under dispute is of greater value to the owner than to the intruder (nonowner). Such 'resource value asymmetries' may be caused by intrinsic factors, such as the physiological state of the contestants. Females of the bethylid wasp Goniozus nephantinis fight for possession of paralysed hosts. A recent study found that larger females tend to win but owner status also confers an advantage. We tested the hypothesis that ownership advantage is linked to differences in egg load (the number of unlaid ripe eggs) between contestant females. Egg loads were highly variable and positively influenced by age, nutrition, body size and host ownership. Owners almost always won owner-intruder contests. The outcomes of owner-owner contests (in which size and status asymmetries were absent) were strongly influenced by differences in egg load.

   GAVIA-IMMER; NEST SITES; FLOATERS; BIRDS; BEHAVIOR; COMPETITION
AB We examined patterns of territory acquisition and reconnaissance in common loons, Gavia immer, from northern Wisconsin. Among all territory acquisitions, 41.5% occurred through passive occupation of territories left vacant after the death or desertion of a previous resident, 17% constituted founding of new territories and the remaining 41.5% came about through, take-over: either usurpation of defended territories or appropriation of territories before the seasonal return of previous owners. Take-overs occurred in both sexes, but individuals acted alone, never in pairs. Displaced breeders usually took refuge on undefended lakes near their former territories; about half of these loons later regained former territories through passive occupation or took possession of new territories elsewhere. As predicted by the reconnaissance hypothesis, usurpations occurred most often in territories that had produced chicks during the previous 12 months, suggesting that loons use the presence or absence of chicks as a cue for territorial usurpation. Large individuals of both sexes held onto territories longer than small individuals, an indication that body size might be correlated with fighting ability. In terms of life history, loons appear to locate good territories through reconnaissance, usurp them in a subsequent year and recover from displacements by reclaiming their original territories or new ones.

AB How colonial animals space their nests in relation to conspecifics may provide clues as to whether coloniality provides net benefits or occurs only because breeding sites are limited. We examined how nearest-neighbour distance varied in relation to settlement time in the highly colonial cliff swallow, Petrochelidon pyrrhonota, comparing observed nearest-neighbour distances to those expected if birds spread out to maximize nest spacing. Cliff swallows generally settled closer to each other than required by the available substrate, and clustered their nests closer in large colonies than in small ones. The first settlers at a colony site spaced themselves further apart than later arrivals but did not maximize nearest-neighbour distances. The first arrivals maintained greater nest spacing throughout the season than did birds that arrived later. Colony size and amount of nesting substrate had no effect on initial settlement distances of the first arrivals, but eventual nearest-neighbour distances declined with colony size. First arrivals may gain less from nesting with conspecifics and thus are less likely to cluster their nests than later arrivals, which may often be young or naive birds that gain more from the social benefits of colonial nesting. The results are consistent with the presumed social advantages cliff swallows receive from coloniality and do not support the hypothesis that colonies result from nesting site limitation.

AB The mating system of the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida involves a vigorous premating struggle during which females attempt to dislodge mounted males by kicking and shaking from side to side. Additionally females can prevent engagement of genitalia by curling their abdomens downwards. Large males gain a mating advantage. Male size is partially determined by a chromosomal inversion polymorphism which is maintained by strong heterosis. Thus female mate choice on the basis of size will affect offspring fitness. We report the occurrence of premating struggles and mate choice for large males in five additional species of seaweed fly, namely, C. nebularum, C. vanduzeei, C. pilipes, Gluma musgravei and G. nitida. Four of these species appear to lack the inversion system, suggesting that mate choice for large males can be maintained in its absence and also evolved before its establishment. Gluma females had stronger preferences than Coelopa females and showed an additional response to mounting, namely, curling their abdomens upwards into the male. This may allow assessment of male site. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Major urinary proteins (MUPs) in the urine of male house mice, Mus domesticus, bind the male signalling volatiles 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (thiazole) and 3,4-dehydro-exo-brevicomin (brevicomin) and slowly release these volatiles from urinary scent marks. To examine the role of urinary proteins and volatiles, either attached or unattached to the proteins, in competitive scent marking, we fractionated urine from isolated male BALB/c laboratory mice, Mus musculus, by size-exclusion chromatography into three pools. Pool I contained all of the urinary proteins and their bound ligands while pools II and III contained lower molecular weight components including unbound signalling volatiles. In experiment 1, pools I-III were streaked out on to absorbent paper (Benchkote) and introduced into enclosures housing single wild-caught male mice, together with a clean control surface. Each male was tested with fresh stimuli and with aged stimuli deposited 24 h previously. Only pool I stimulated significantly more countermarking and investigation than the control, attracting mice to investigate from a distance even when the rate of ligand release was considerably reduced after 24 h. Experiment 2 examined responses to pool I when this was fresh, aged by 7 days, or had been mixed with menadione to displace ligands from the proteins. Although all three protein stimuli were investigated and countermarked more than a clean control, the aged and menadione-treated pool I stimulated the strongest responses, despite containing the lowest levels of thiazole and brevicomin. Thus competitive countermarking is stimulated by proteins or by nonvolatile protein-ligand complexes in male urine, while release of volatile ligands attracts attention to a competitor's scent marks.

AB Many bird species have white spots in their tails or wing feathers, and such characters have been hypothesized to be either reliable signals (handicaps) or amplifiers that facilitate the message of a signal. In barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, the size of the white spots in the tail feathers is sexually dimorphic and positively correlated with feather length. We tested whether such spots act as handicaps or amplifiers. These white spots affect sexual selection in barn swallows, as shown by an experiment in which we randomly subjected males to (1) a considerable reduction of the size of all the spots by the use of a black permanent marker pen, (2) a small reduction of the size of the spots, or (3) no reduction. There was a positive association between spot size and the number of offspring produced per season. The white tail spots were preferred by feather-eating Mallophaga as a feeding site: holes made by Mallophaga were more abundant in the white spots than expected by chance. A habitat choice experiment with Mallophaga on barn swallow tail feathers revealed that they preferred white spots over black parts of the tail feathers. We therefore expected long-tailed male barn swallows to have more Mallophaga than short-tailed males. However, the opposite relationship was observed, indicating that long-tailed males may reliably signal their quality by the presence of large white tail spots without parasite damage. Thus white tail spots in barn swallows appear to be a reliable signal of phenotypic quality. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Opposite to the predictions of standard models of time allocation during incubation, parents spent a much greater percentage of each 24-h period incubating when the rate of clutch cooling was reduced. Incubation bouts lasted significantly longer on experimental nests than on control nests, both during the daytime and overnight. Mean foraging bout duration did not differ between the two groups of nests. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that parental foraging success cues the end of a foraging bout, and that parental energy level cues the end of an incubation bout. However, most previous studies suggest that parents spend less time incubating when the rate of clutch cooling is slow. If parental energy level cues departure, these results can be explained only if the amount of time available for incubation is constrained in these cases by the time a parent must spend foraging in order to maintain body condition. Such parents should take more time away from incubation when the unattended clutch cools slowly, as this is when the cost of being absent is minimized.

AB Many apparent interspecific mutualisms are poorly understood. Although theory has focused on the various evolutionary problems peculiar to mutualism, especially the need to identify mechanisms that protect a mutualism from cheating or exploitation, there are relatively few quantified examples of how organisms actually interact. Oxpeckers are believed to benefit their mammalian hosts by reducing tick loads, an assumption based on the fact that the birds include ticks in their diet. I watched red-billed oxpeckers foraging on domestic cattle in the Limpopo Valley between August 1996 and September 1997. From focal watches of 41 individually colour-ringed oxpeckers, I found that birds fed mainly on wounds, in ears and by 'scissoring' with the bill (a distinctive feeding technique). Observable tick feeding represented a very small percentage of their foraging time. Based on oxpecker behaviour at feeding sites, blood from open wounds appeared to be the favoured food: oxpeckers displaced each other significantly more, and were significantly less likely to be deterred by the cows' attempts to remove them, when feeding on a wound than at other feeding sites. The preference for blood, the inability of cows to prevent oxpeckers feeding on blood and the relatively small amount of visible tick feeding suggest that, certainly for cattle, oxpeckers may not be beneficial. However, as cows have not coevolved with oxpeckers, these results may not be representative of oxpecker relations with native African mammalian hosts.

AB During the breeding season an individual's access to mates may be affected by operational sex ratios, causing strong variation in mating success. We manipulated adult sex ratios of the European lobster, Homarus gammarus, to test the predictions of models that relate sexual competition to (1) the sex ratio, (2) the time that an individual is not available to mate and (3) 'collateral investment', whereby two males contribute to a single clutch. The model predictions proved to be relatively insensitive to collateral investment Male-male competition predominated in the male-biased but not in the female-biased sex ratio. This matches the predictions of one model that incorporates an extended period of female receptivity because the time that a male was unavailable to mate was small compared to the time spent by females in cohabitation and parental care. Although females increased their competitiveness when males were in the minority, male competition remained high. The insensitivity of male-male competition to sex ratios may be due to an upper limit to the costs that males can afford when there is a serious risk of injury, preventing males from increasing their aggression when females are in short supply.

AB In group-living Malagasy primates (Lemuriformes), certain demographic and morphological traits deviate both from theoretical expectations derived from sexual selection theory and from patterns in better-known anthropoid primates. Lemurs lack sexual dimorphism in body and canine size and live in relatively small multimale-multifemale groups with, on average, even adult sex ratios, despite a polygynous mating system. In addition, the majority of gregarious lemurs are cathemeral, that is, they are regularly active both day and night. The social system of cathemeral lemurs has been considered an adaptation to their activity pattern. If so, groups should consist of multiple pairs that aggregate during diurnal activity and range separately at night in response to predation and infanticide risk, respectively. Moreover, mating privileges should exist between pair partners. We tested this hypothesis with data collected on two groups of wild redfronted lemurs in western Madagascar during 1023 focal animal hours spanning 4 months including the mating season. In addition, data on spatial relations were collected on 12 nights. We found no differences in group cohesion between day and night and no behavioural evidence for multiple male-female pairs. Instead, one male in each group monopolized social interactions with all females. However, females copulated with all resident males, although most often with the central male. Thus, basic predictions df the cathemerality hypothesis are unsupported. Multiple matings and indications of oestrous synchrony can be viewed as female counterstrategies against infanticide, whereas reproductive strategies of redfronted lemur males remain obscure.

AB Scent marking on top of (overmarking), or in the vicinity of, a scent mark already present is commonly termed countermarking. Scent marks and countermarks provide a continuous record of competitive challenges between, conspecifics, thus providing a reliable advertisement of an individual's,ability to dominate or defend an area to other competitors and potential mates. To test the hypothesis that females should prefer males that countermark competing scent marks in their territory over those whose own marks are partially countermarked by a competing male, we manipulated scent marks in the-territories of neighbouring male house mice (captive-bred Mus domesticus). As predicted, oestrous females were more strongly attracted to approach territory owners that countermarked the scent mark challenges of competitors than those that had been countermarked, and females,themselves deposited more scent marks near the scents of these males. To investigate whether female mice use scent age, overlap or intrinsic qualitative or quantitative differences between scent marks and countermarks to make this discrimination, we redeposited male scent marks artificially as marks and partially overlapping countermarks, with or without a 24-h age difference between them. While the intrinsic quality or quantity of countermarks did not affect discrimination, an age difference between the original mark and subsequent countermark was important for consistent discrimination. The ultimate function of such competitive scent signalling thus may be to provide potential mates with a reliable indicator of the competitive ability of individuals advertising their high status: Since scent marks remain in the environment and are continuously available to challenge and investigation, they may provide a particularly effective and reliable means of dominance advertisement.

AB Fluctuating asymmetries (left-right differences in symmetric traits) can be negatively related to fitness parameters in a number of biological systems. Hence, it has been suggested that symmetric individuals should outcompete asymmetric individuals during intraspecific agonistic encounters. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence for such a relationship. We investigated the relationship between trait asymmetry (both directional and fluctuating asymmetry) and the outcome of agonistic encounters among size-matched male shore crabs. Our findings indicate that cheliped ('weapon claw') directional asymmetry is not related to the outcome of fights, whereas fluctuating asymmetry in the fifth pereiopod, but not the second pereiopod, is negatively related to the likelihood of winning conspecific aggressive encounters. This relationship is most readily explained by a biomechanical advantage in symmetric individuals, as the fifth pereiopod is likely to be mechanically important in maintaining stability and balance during fighting. There is no evidence that asymmetry (in traits that display fluctuating asymmetry) is related to an intrinsic individual quality factor. None the less, the relative mechanical advantage of low asymmetry may give rise to fitness benefits in symmetric crabs that may have evolutionary consequences.

AB Gambel's white-crowned sparrow, Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii, is a long-distance migrant that, in contrast to other subspecies of white-crowned sparrow, does not form vocal dialects. I studied the process of vocal development in the field and laboratory to determine how it differed from the process in three other subspecies previously studied. Four common song types existed in a random spatial pattern in my 2.6-km(2) study area. Of 106 males studied in 2 years, all arrived at the beginning of the breeding season singing their adult repertoire and no male changed his song during the;season. In the laboratory, hand-reared males overproduced as much as other migratory subspecies of white-crowned sparrow; They learned their songs during the shortest sensitive phase of any white-crowned sparrow yet studied. In contrast to other subspecies that form vocal dialects, male gambelii chose their final adult song at random from their overproduced repertoire. I suggest the absence of vocal dialects in Gambel's sparrow results from the short, delayed breeding season on their sub-arctic breeding grounds. The short breeding season has favoured a narrow sensitive phase in hatching-year birds, and prevents the extended vocal interactions among adults that lead to vocal dialects in populations breeding at temperate latitudes.

AB lAlthough mountain gorillas, Gorilla gorilla beringei, are classified as having a one-male mating system, approximately 40% of the social units are multimale groups. I observed two multimale groups of mountain gorillas at the Karisoke Research Center, Rwanda, Africa, for 17 months to determine male mating patterns and male-male mating harassment in relation to both male dominance rank and female reproductive status. Dominant males mated significantly more than did individual subordinate males, and dominant males mated more with cycling adult and pregnant females. The dominant males participated in 47 and 83% of observed matings in the two groups. Subordinate males were more likely than dominant males to mate with subadult females. Eleven of 14 females were observed to mate with more than one male, and multiple males mated with three of the five females observed at the probable time of conception. Mating harassment was initiated and received by both dominant and subordinate males. Mating harassment occurred infrequently (during 30 and 22% of matings in each group), usually consisted of mild aggression; and usually terminated copulations by subordinate males, but not those by dominant males. These results suggest that multimale mountain gorilla groups can be favourable environments for subordinate males to obtain mating opportunities. Dominant males may be unable or unwilling to prevent subordinate males from mating. Based on behavioural observations, mountain gorillas can have a multimale mating system but further research on the role of females in male mating success and paternity determination is needed to understand fully this species' mating system.

AB Extrapair paternity has been suggested to represent a potentially important source of sexual selection on male secondary sexual characters, particularly in birds with predominantly socially monogamous mating systems. However, relatively few studies have demonstrated sexual selection within single species by this mechanism, and there have been few attempts to assess the importance of extrapair paternity in relation to other mechanisms of sexual selection. We report estimates of sexual selection gradients on male secondary sexual plumage characters resulting from extrapair paternity in the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis, and compare the importance of this form of sexual selection with that resulting from variation in mate fecundity. Microsatellite genotyping revealed that 15% of nestlings, distributed nonrandomly among 33% of broods (N = 79), were the result of extrapair copulations. Multivariate selection analyses revealed significant positive directional sexual selection on two uncorrelated secondary sexual characters in males (forehead and wing patch size) when fledgling number was used as the measure of fitness. When number of offspring recruiting to the breeding population was used as the measure of male fitness, selection on these traits appeared to be directional and stabilizing, respectively. Pairwise comparisons of cuckolded and cuckolding males revealed that males that sired young through extrapair copulations had wider forehead patches, and were paired to females that bred earlier, than the males that they cuckolded. Path analysis was used to partition selection on these traits into pathways via mate fecundity and sperm competition, and suggested that the sperm competition pathway accounted for between 64 and 90% of the total sexual selection via the two paths. The selection revealed in these analyses is relatively weak in comparison with many other measures of selection in natural populations. We offer some explanations for the relatively weak selection detected. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB To examine the role of the pair male in ensuring paternity in the wheatear, we removed pair males for 24 h during the fertile period (days 0 to +1 in 1992 and days -5 to -1 in 1993, where day 0 = first egg date). Control males were removed during incubation. The frequency and duration of intrusions, and the frequency of extrapair copulations (EPCs), increased during removals in the fertile period, but not during incubation. The frequency of extrapair paternity (EPP) was marginally higher (25%) in experimental than control broods and the presence of the pair male seemed particularly important in ensuring paternity in those days immediately preceding laying. Females were selective over which males they copulated with in the absence of their mate and rejected the majority of attempted EPCs. Only extrapair males in better body condition than the removed pair male eventually gained successful matings. Experimental males in poorer body condition were also more likely to have EPP in their brood than experimental males in better body condition. Female copulatory behaviour was the most important factor in determining patterns of paternity, and mate-guarding behaviours by the pair male appeared to limit the females' opportunities to engage in EPCs by reducing the frequency and duration of intrusions, rather than to control female behaviour directly.

AB For species such as the red fox, spatio-temporal variation in resource availability may promote group living even when the benefits of group formation are not of significant magnitude to promote territorial expansion and delayed dispersal. In this paper we use data from an urban fox population to compare the relative benefits of dispersal and natal philopatry as routes to attaining dominant status and investigate the potential benefits of territory inheritance, alloparental care and reproduction to subdominant individuals. More offspring, of either sex, remained on their natal territory than dispersed. The annual rate of retention of dominant status and the annual mortality rate of subdominant animals was high, such that the majority of subdominant animals never became dominant. The mortality rate of dispersing individuals was also high. The relative success rate of dispersal and philopatry as routes to dominance were broadly similar, although several philopatric offspring became dominant only after their natal territory was divided: in the absence of such changes, dispersal was more likely to lead to dominant status. Thus, it is likely that some other benefit was accrued by philopatric individuals. The majority of subdominants provisioned cubs. This did not increase the number of cubs reared but reduced the level of provisioning by dominants: whether this promoted dominants' longevity is unknown. There were high levels of reproduction by subordinate females and the levels of alloparental care by subdominants of both sexes suggest that there are comparable levels of direct reproduction by subdominant males.

AB Gammarid crustacea exhibit precopula mate guarding in which a male will carry a potential mate beneath his ventral surface, guarding her for several days until she moults and lays her eggs. I investigated the role of the calceoli (bulb-like structures on the second antennae) in mate assessment and precopula pairing in two Gammarus species by comparing the behaviour of males with and without calceoli. Removal of the calceoli had no effect on the pattern of size-assortative mating, nor did it reduce the number of contacts made per unit time between potential mates. However, males without calceoli reduced their assessment of potential mates, were less likely to guard a suitable female and guarded for a shorter period. These data support the hypothesis that calceoli are used during contact assessment to determine a female's intermoult period and hence suitability for guarding.

AB Female convict cichlids, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, typically develop orange ventral coloration which males do not. We investigated the behavioural significance of this sexual dichromatism using both live and dummy stimulus fish. In our experiments, males were insensitive to variation in ventral coloration. Females, however, appeared to use this colour pattern as a visual cue. Females directed significantly more behaviour, including aggressive behaviour, towards more brightly coloured stimulus fish, as well as towards dummies with orange ventral coloration compared with those without. Bright females displayed the least aggression towards an intruding female of intermediate coloration. Thus, sexual dichromatism in the convict cichlid is shown to affect intrasexual aggression among females. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Association indices were originally developed to describe species co-occurrences, but have been used increasingly to measure associations between individuals. However, no statistical method has been published that allows one to test the extent to which the observed association index values differ from those of a randomly associating population. Here, we describe an adaptation of a test developed by Manly (1995, Ecology, 76, 1109-1115), which uses the observed association data as a basis for a computer-generated randomization. The observed pattern of association is tested against a randomly created one while retaining important features of the original data, for example group size and sighting frequency. We applied this new method to test four data sets of associations from two populations of Hector's dolphin, Cephalorhynchus hectori, using the Half-Weight Index (HWI) as an example of a measure of association. The test demonstrated that populations with similar median HWI values showed clear differences in association patterns, that is, some were associating nonrandomly whereas others were not. These results highlight the benefits of using this new testing method in order to validate the analysis of association indices. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Testosterone affects the allocation of reproductive effort in male birds. Elevated testosterone causes male dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, to decrease care of dependant offspring, but this generalization is based largely on reduced provisioning rates by males treated with testosterone. Therefore, we used a predator model to explore the relationship between testosterone and nest defence, a more immediate measure of male parental effort. Control males (C-males) were more likely to respond within 10 min to a mount of an eastern chipmunk, Tamias striatus, placed at the nest than were testosterone-treated males (T-males). However, among males that did respond within 10 min, T-males initiated nest defence as fast as C-males and defended the nest with equal intensity. Females initiated nest defence more rapidly and struck the mount more often than their mates, regardless of the male's treatment. Overall, the decreased likelihood of T-males being present for nest defence(perhaps mediated by their large home ranges) may increase predation rates at their nests and represent an important cost of elevated testosterone levels.

AB For begging to benefit chicks, parents must respond to increased begging by bringing more food. To investigate whether parents change their provisioning in response to begging levels, I enhanced the begging levels of broods of yellow-headed blackbirds, Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus, using recorded vocalizations. In a short-term experiment, females and males doubled their visits to broods without reducing their load sizes during 2 h of playback. Nestlings gained more mass during-the playback period than during a 2-h control period. In a long-term experiment, nestlings gained more mass in nests from which begging calls were broadcast over a 5-day period than nestlings in nests without playback.

AB The Cape ground squirrel is;a highly social, tropical ground squirrel that does not hibernate, suggesting that female receptivity could be scattered throughout the year. Males in this species are very:social, living in all-male bands. I studied the mating tactics of male Cape ground squirrels to examine the effects of year-round female receptivity and male grouping on these tactics and on the degree of. intrasexual competition. Female breeding was highly irregular and unpredictable, and the average operational sex ratio during oestrus was 10:1 (males to females). However, the predicted high rates of aggression were not observed. Instead, competition among males was manifested by competitive searching, repeated-copulations and disruptions of copulations: Dominant males had more copulations with more females, first: access to females and were more likely to copulate below-ground where-disruptions were;unlikely to occur. I conclude that the mating-patterns of males in this species are a product of the asynchrony of female oestrus, year-round breeding and the survival benefits of grouping: (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We tested this by recording male and female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, as they were subjected to various levels of white noise. Both sexes increased amplitude levels of vocalization in response to increased levels of noise. Similar results were obtained with humans (the 'Lombard effect').

AB Observations of newly mated Drosophila melanogaster females suggest that females control the times at which components of the ejaculate cause behavioural and physiological changes characteristic of fertilized females. Females that were assayed immediately after they mated elicited as much courtship as they did when they were virgins, but were unreceptive to copulation. Within a few minutes of when they disengaged from copulation, most females performed ovipositor extrusion, which has been classified as a rejection behaviour, in response to courting males or males that had previously performed courtship. Most females that were assayed immediately after mating had already ovulated. The females, however, do not begin to lay eggs until 4-6 h after mating,at which time they elicit very little courtship (Scott & Richmond 1985, Anim. Behav., 33, 817-824). Our observations suggest that neither ovipositor extrusion nor male-synthesized pheromones that are transferred to females' cuticles during copulation inhibit males' courtship of newly fertilized females. Thus, males cannot determine that newly fertilized females are unreceptive to copulation. These observations a.lso indicate that the failure of newly fertilized females to mate with males is not a consequence of the females' inability to elicit vigorous courtship.

AB Rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta, on the island of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico produce one or more of five acoustically distinctive calls when they find food. Three of these calls ('warbles', 'harmonic arches' and 'chirps') are produced by individuals finding high-quality, rare food items, whereas the other two calls ('coos' and 'grunts') are produced upon encountering lower-quality, common food items, and in non-food contexts as well. To determine how rhesus classify such acoustic variation, I conducted habituation experiments using a subset of the five call types. I designed experiments to reveal whether classification is based primarily on acoustic features or on the basis of a call's functional referent; caller identity was held constant within sessions. Habituation to 'warbles' transferred to 'harmonic arches', and vice versa. Thus, although these two calls are acoustically distinctive, they appeared to be perceptually clustered into one category based on referential similarities. In contrast, habituation to 'grunts' was followed by dishabituation to 'warbles' or 'harmonic arches', and habituation to 'warbles' or 'harmonic arches' was followed by dishabituation to 'grunts'. Dishabituation could be due to acoustic or referential differences. Significantly, the magnitude of the dishabituating response was asymmetric and depended upon the call type used in the habituation series. Thus, when subjects were habituated to 'grunts', they responded significantly more to tests of 'warbles' or 'harmonic arches' than when the sequence was reversed. These results suggest that for rhesus monkey food-associated calls, referential differences carry more weight during perceptual classification than do acoustical differences.

AB According to predictions from theoretical models, body mass and the daily foraging pattern of small birds in winter should be sensitive to predation risk. With increased risk of predation birds are expected to lower their body mass and shift their foraging to the afternoons. I studied the effect of predator presence on daily mass gain in captive yellowhammers, Emberiza citrinella. The birds were tested in unisex pairs, one bird being dominant over the other. In the first treatment the amount of food was restricted, and the daily pattern of mass gain was recorded. The second treatment was identical to the first, but, in addition, a stuffed sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, was displayed to the birds in the morning. Contrary to predictions from some theoretical models and other studies, the birds gained weight on days when the hawk was shown. Furthermore, the increased foraging happened mainly in the first half of the day, which also contradicts predictions from models. These results could be explained as a response to interrupted foraging, decreasing the probability of the birds acquiring the critical evening body mass. Alternatively, the birds increased their body reserves in preparation to leave a dangerous situation. Both dominance classes showed a similar response. The results suggest that the effects of predators on foraging interruptions should be included in models of daily routines of reserve accumulation.

AB Warmer environmental temperatures are likely to increase the frequency of predator-prey interactions in ectothermic animals, and therefore might be expected to influence anti-predator behaviour. In a first experiment, groups of recently fed guppies, placed in a novel environment, schooled significantly more closely at 26 degrees than at 22 degrees C. Changes in two of three measures of schooling tendency over time indicated that aggregation increased during the trial periods, probably as a result of increased familiarity within the experimental groups. In a second experiment, pairs of female guppies were tested at 22 degrees and 26 degrees C, with and without predation threat from a confined cichlid. From multifactor analysis of 18 behaviour types, temperature was shown to affect behavioural time budgets profoundly, particularly in the presence of the predator. At the higher temperature, a shift occurred from inactive anti-predator behaviours and minimal foraging activity towards active predator inspection-related behaviours and a much higher level of feeding. Guppies in the warmer water might have been physically able to school more closely as a result of faster swimming ability, or might have used temperature as a cue indicating higher potential predation risk, and aggregated accordingly. The use of temperature as a source of information about the biotic environment is discussed. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Male-biased mortality in young animals is often viewed as adaptive discrimination against male offspring by parents unable to raise reproductively competitive sons. Unequivocal evidence of the presence or absence of parental discrimination against males is lacking, however, and the adaptive interpretation of male-biased mortality is confounded by an alternative explanation that it reflects differential energetic requirements between the sexes (due to sexual selection for large size in;mature males) independent of parental manipulation. To determine whether maternal discrimination against offspring explains postnatal mortality in a sexually dimorphic rodent, we examined patterns of growth and mortality in offspring of food-restricted and food-enriched lactating bushy-tailed woodrats, Neotoma cinerea. We also monitored mothers and their litters daily throughout lactation for evidence of maternal discrimination against offspring. Offspring of food-restricted mothers showed depressed growth, and mortality of offspring born to both food-restricted and food-enriched mothers was male-biased, but in the absence of maternal discrimination. Offspring that died were no less likely to be attached to their mother's teats in the 10 days prior to death than were offspring that successfully weaned. Similarly, offspring of food-restricted mothers were attached as often as were offspring of food-enriched mothers. In a series of behavioural arena trials in the first 10 days after birth, restricted mothers were no less attentive toward their sons than they were to their daughters, nor did mothers treat their offspring that did not survive to weaning differently from those that survived. Our findings provide empirical evidence that postnatal, sex-biased mortality in offspring is not necessarily due to parental intervention, and they call into question the adaptive interpretations of previous examples of sex-biased offspring mortality.

AB Fish of the family Goodeidae have an advanced form of viviparity but males lack a specialized copulatory organ. Goodeids show reduced sexual-size dimorphism compared with the other livebearing families of the order Cyprinodontiformes, I investigated some mechanisms of sexual selection acting on body size in the goodeid fish Xenotoca eiseni. Both males and females strongly prefer mates of their own size. Comparison of mating activities in pairs with various degrees of size difference between males and females showed that matched pairs copulated more successfully. Similar mate preference in the two sexes thus appears to be the consequence of the primitive method of internal fertilization that requires the partners to be exactly synchronized during sperm transfer. Competition for access to a female was intense and body size determined the hierarchy in a small group, However, unless the size of the female was close to that of the dominant male, assortative mate preferences prevailed and the large-male advantage in competition was offset. Reduced size dimorphism in X. eiseni and in other goodeids may be explained by constraints on the action of sexual selection imposed by the need for effective fertilization.

   FOWL
AB Laying hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, show individual Variation in pre-laying behaviour including their ultimate choice of nest site. In housing systems with nestboxes, the majority of hens make a small number of long visits to nestboxes and lay their eggs therein, but some hens make many short visits and occasionally lay outside the nestbox. We investigated the motivational basis of this individual variation using six consistent hens which always laid in nestboxes and six inconsistent hens which sometimes laid outside nestboxes. Each hen was housed in a pen (containing either no nestbox, a semi-enclosed nestbox or an enclosed nestbox) with access to a ring-shaped tunnel which increased the opportunity to perform locomotor activity. Access to the tunnel could be restricted by narrowing the doorway to 140, 125, 110 or 95 mm (compared with a mean hen width of 114 mm). In trials with no nestbox, there was no difference in the pre-laying behaviour of consistent and inconsistent hens. Narrowing the doorway reduced the number of visits to the tunnel, but all hens persisted in visiting the tunnel and doorwidth had no effect on time spent therein. With both designs of nestbox, however, inconsistent hens visited the tunnel more often than consistent hens prior to oviposition, and continued to pass the narrowest doors to enter the tunnel, whilst consistent hens would not pass doors of 110 or 95 mm. After oviposition, there was no difference in the two groups' behaviour in any treatment and no hens would pass doors of either 110 or 95 mm to visit the tunnel. Individual variation in nest-site choice, therefore, appeared to result from different perception of nestboxes rather than lower nesting motivation. Inconsistent hens worked as hard as consistent hens to perform pre-laying locomotion, but appeared to be less responsive to the cues provided by nestboxes than consistent hens, because they persisted with pre-laying locomotion when provided with either design of nestbox.

AB Parent-offspring recognition appears to be highly developed in species in which the risk of misdirecting care is high (e.g. colonial species). Some of the best evidence for this relationship comes from comparative work on swallows of the family Hirundinidae. Using methods followed in earlier studies, we determined whether parent-offspring recognition occurs in the tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor, a non-colonial species closely related to the highly colonial bank swallow, Riparia riparia, and the solitary rough-winged swallow, Stelgidopteryx ruficollis. Parents did not discriminate between playbacks of the calls of their own versus non-related nestlings. However, older nestlings called more in response to playback of parental calls than non-parental calls, suggesting that they recognized their own parents. Despite significant individual variation in parental and nestling calls, variation in tree swallow nestling calls was lower than analogous calls in the bank swallow. Our results provide further support for a positive relationship between recognition, individual variation in call structure and coloniality.

AB Adult female brown long-eared bats, Plecotus auritus, were taken into captivity over a 3-year period and housed in two free-flight enclosures. They were maintained in small groups, each roosting in a single, heated roost box while monitored by an infra-red sensitive video camera. The predicted percentage of records spent by lactating females in direct contact with the young on day 1 of lactation did not differ significantly from 100%. This declined to 13% on day 50 of lactation. Over time, the mothers groomed the young less. Lactating females visited the roost more times per night, but spent less time self grooming than non-reproductive females. The total amount of grooming behaviour (estimated as the percentage of records spent in self grooming plus those allocated to grooming of the young) for lactating females was 50% of the value for non-reproductive females. In general, care-giving behaviours declined with the progress of lactation. The temporal expression of these behaviours was opposite in direction to that of the expected energetic demands of milk production. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID RATS; MONKEYS
AB A laboratory experiment was conducted in order to explore the possibility of imitation, that is, response learning by observation, in marmosets, Callithrix jacchus. Inexperienced individuals were allowed to observe a skilful model that demonstrated one of two possible techniques (pushing or pulling a pendulum-door) to get food from inside a wooden box, Their initial manipulative actions, performed when exposed to the box in a subsequent test, were compared with those of naive control subjects (non-observers). The observers showed less exploratory behaviour than the non-observers and, more importantly, some showed a strong tendency to use the demonstrated opening technique in the initial test phase. This initial preference disappeared in the course of five test sessions and the observers converged towards the simpler, alternative solution that was generally preferred by the non-observers. Despite fundamental individual differences in the observer group and the failure to find a significant group effect, the results indicate that marmosets are capable of learning simple motor skills through conspecific observation.

AB Playback experiments were used to investigate the perception of frequency variations in perch coos by collared doves, Stteptopelia decaocto. Territorial males responded more strongly to modulated than to unmodulated coos. This effect was seen whether all three elements of the coo, or just the first element, were modulated. Modulated coos differed from unmodulated coos in two ways, first by an increased average frequency, and second, by the presence of a discrete change in frequency. We show that it was the change in frequency that was responsible for the level of response to modulated coos. The stronger responses to modulated coos are interpreted as a result of the receiver rating the sender as a stronger competitor. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Free food or earned food? A review and fuzzy model of contrafreeloading

   SELECTION; TRACKING; WORK
AB Animals will work (e.g. lever press) for 'earned' food even though identical 'free' food can easily be obtained from a nearby dish. This phenomenon, called contrafreeloading, appears to contradict a basic tenet of most learning, motivation and optimal foraging theories; namely that animals strive to maximize the ratio of reward, or benefit, to effort, or cost. This paper reviews the factors that have been found to affect the level of contrafreeloading, to try to explain the behaviour. In experiments involving intensive training, contrafreeloading may be explained on the basis of secondary reinforcement and/or differential exposure to the alternative food sources. However, contrafreeloading also occurs without prior training. Contrafreeloading declines with increasing hunger and with increases in the effort required to obtain the earned food: it also has an inverted-U relationship with the degree of stimulus change associated with the earned food. A fuzzy logic model is developed to predict the outcome of interactions between these factors. The model successfully simulates previous empirical findings and provides novel, testable predictions. It is argued that contrafreeloading does not contradict reinforcement theory, provided that the sensory reinforcement obtained from stimuli associated with the earned food is also taken into account. A functional explanation of why such stimuli are reinforcing, and of contrafreeloading itself, is based upon the advantage of gathering information for animals living in changing environments (i.e. an information primacy model). Animals work for earned food in order to update their estimate of a currently sub-optimal food source because, in the longer term, it may unpredictably become the optimal place to feed. Contrafreeloading is therefore a behaviour that, under natural conditions, is adaptive. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Fighting is costly. Therefore, it is to an animal's advantage to assess the abilities of its opponent and compete more strongly against weaker competitors and avoid contests with stronger competitors. However, assessment may also be difficult or costly, making it sometimes advantageous for the animal to avoid direct assessment. This study examines male-male contests over access to females in the spider Argyrodes antipodiana. Pairs of naive males in their first contest were more likely to escalate that contest if the pair consisted of large males. Thus large males were inherently more likely to escalate contests than small males. Second, males that had had experience at winning contests were more likely to win subsequent contests against spiders of the same size who had had experience at losing contests. These trained spiders responded differently from the onset of the contest suggesting that their experience had altered their perception of their chance of winning the current contest. These two results suggest means by which direct assessment may be reduced, and yet observed interactions could still follow predictions from game theory models. Mechanisms by which experience may reduce assessment are discussed. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Nest building signals male condition rather than age in wrens
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUAL SELECTION; GALLINAGO-MEDIA; DARWIN FINCHES; GREAT SNIPE; SUCCESS;
   SIZE; FEMALES; CHOICE
AB An ornament used in mate choice may vary with male age for two reasons. It may be designed to signal age and females could use such an ornament to mate preferentially with older males that may be expected to be of higher quality. Alternatively, if an ornament is condition-dependent it would be expected to vary with age because condition is expected to increase with age. These hypotheses make different predictions about the variation of an ornament with male age between individuals within a year and between years within an individual's lifetime. Female wrens, Troglodytes troglodytes, have been shown to discriminate between males on the basis of the number of cock nests on their territories. An analysis using information from males of known age showed that as males got older they built more nests per season, started building earlier in the year and built for longer. A previous analysis had demonstrated that the number of nests on a territory was influenced by habitat structure and that male age failed to predict any of the inter-male variation in number of nests constructed within a year. This was supported by the present study: male age was not a good predictor of variation in the number of nests constructed between males within a year. As variation within a year between different males is much greater than the variation between years within a male's lifetime it is effectively impossible for a female to mate selectively with older males; rather it suggests that nest construction in male wrens is a condition-dependent trait and not a signal of male age. This analysis suggests that some males are more accomplished nest builders than others and that while males do improve with age, age cannot compensate for a lack of ability.

AB Little agreement has been reached as to whether kleptoparasitic gulfs, Larus spp., preferentially target adult, juvenile or just successful brown pelicans, Pelecanus occidentalis, and no studies have determined kleptoparasite success when targeting pelicans of different age classes. In 1991 and 1992, foraging brown pelicans and kleptoparasitic laughing gulls, L. atricilla, roseate terns, Sterna dougallii, and sandwich terns, S. sandvicensis, were studied to determine host choice, kleptoparasite success and exploitability of pelicans by gulls and terns. Adult pelicans had a higher foraging success than juveniles in 1991 but not in 1992. Gulls and terns were more likely to target adult pelicans than juveniles, but the strength of this effect was stronger in 1991 than in 1992. Gulls and terns were also more likely to target successful than unsuccessful pelicans, and the strength of this effect did not differ between years. Kleptoparasites had a higher probability of success when targeting adult rather than juvenile pelicans and when targeting successful rather than unsuccessful pelicans. Successful pelicans were more likely than unsuccessful pelicans to use evasive manoeuvres, and prey capture success among kleptoparasites was greater when successful pelicans used evasive manoeuvres. Handling times did not differ between the two pelican age classes. Kleptoparasitic gulls and terns may not necessarily differentiate between 'reliable' and 'exploitable' victims, as previously suggested, because in the present study adult pelicans were the more reliable class, as well as the more exploitable class.

AB The effects of temporary male absence during egg laying on the production of extra-pair young by female eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, were examined. Females whose mates were removed for 2 days during egg laying produced more extra-pair young than did females whose mates were present during egg laying. Replacement males were observed at three of 11 nests from which resident males were temporarily removed, and one of 13 extra-pair young was sired by a replacement male. The increased production of extra-pair young when males were removed during egg laying suggests that (1) faced with apparent mate loss, females used copulations in an attempt to attract replacement males to care for young, (2) females were released from the constraints of mate guarding and sought extra-pair copulations, or (3) absence during egg laying reduced the ability of males to devalue rival sperm via supplemental copulations.

AB The frequency and heritability of 13 behavioural acts of hatchling Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, were measured in a laboratory experiment to examine their relationship to juvenile and adult dominance. The heritability of similar acts in adult quail were also quantified to determine how heritability estimates changed with age. Juvenile dominance rank, determined by frequency of winning conflicts, was uncorrelated with the frequency of any hatchling behaviour or hatchling body size but contained significant additive genetic variance in both males and females. Dominance rank in adult females, measured similarly, also had a high heritability estimate. Dominance in adult males, measured as frequency of initiating a fight and frequency of mounting, had only low heritability. Dominance ranking in adults was uncorrelated with the dominance ranking of juveniles. Dominance may be heritable but may not respond to natural selection because of the interaction between the genotype and the environment. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Copulation in Rhizoglyphus robini usually lasts only 20 min, but pairs may associate for many hours. The aim of this study was to examine the function of the prolonged mate association in this species. Prolonged copulations did not result in the transfer of more sperm. Females mated frequently, but males that remained in association with females effectively prevented their re-mating with other males. In double matings the proportion of eggs fertilized by the second male to mate was 0.537. When the time between female matings was manipulated, the proportion of eggs a male fertilized increased with the time the female took to re-mate with another partner. These findings indicate that prolonged mate association functions as a form of post-copulatory mate guarding: a male that can exclude other males from mating with the female he inseminated benefits by increasing his paternity. Also consistent with the mate-guarding hypothesis was the finding that the duration of pair association increased with the male:female ratio, but was independent of the frequency of previous female matings.

AB The outcome of interactions between individuals depends on the sex of the interacting individuals as well as asymmetries in residency or body size. This study tested the effects of these asymmetries on the agonistic and sensory behaviour of the western plethodontid salamander Ensatina eschscholtzii. Behaviour was observed during the non-courtship season for same-sex, same-population pairs. Asymmetries due to resident status had strong effects on agonistic and sensory behaviour. Residents were more aggressive than intruders, and intruders nose-tapped more frequently than residents. Asymmetries in body size had weaker effects. These results suggest that residents are capable of marking, recognizing and defending home areas, and that intruders are capable of assessing their role as interlopers in other salamanders' home areas. The defence of home areas further suggests that Ensatina may be territorial. The effects of asymmetries of residency on behaviour also differed between the sexes. Males performed more aggressive behaviour than females, and females performed more sensory behaviour than males. Males may be more aggressive than females because they are more territorial and/or because intra-sexual competition (mate competition) is stronger between males than between females. Sex differences in sensory behaviour suggest that females may rely more heavily than males on olfactory reception to assess territories and/or competitors and potentially to assess mates.

AB Female bank voles suppress their reproduction when the risk of small mustelid predation is high. The mechanism for this reproductive suppression is unknown. Because rodents are known to alter their oestrous cycle in response to changing environmental conditions, the effect of predation risk on the oestrous cycle of bank vole females was studied. The oestrous cycles of 24 females divided into two treatments (predation risk and control) were observed for 20 days using female receptivity as an indication of oestrus. Voles exposed for 2-3 h a day for 20 days to the close presence of a least weasel, Mustela nivalis nivalis, had fewer oestrous cycles than control females exposed to a domestic rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus. Females under predation risk had more abnormally long cycles than did control females. The number of days females were in oestrus tended to be lower in the predator-exposure group than in the control group. For those females that performed lordosis, the latency to lordosis did not differ between treatments. The amount of food consumed or weight change in females did not differ between treatments. The results indicate that female bank voles may respond to predation risk by suppressing their oestrous cycle. Suppressed oestrus may be a mechanism for the breeding suppression observed under the risk of small mustelid predation in female voles. Whether females suppressing oestrus have selective advantage in terms of future survival requires further study. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Natal dispersal of European wild rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, was studied in a 2-ha outdoor enclosure between 1988 and 1990. The rabbit population had been established in 1984 and by 1988 it was structured into nine territories. The enclosure conditions allowed detailed study of dispersal of individual juveniles from their natal territories. Eighty-eight per cent (first year:) and 65% (second year) of juveniles that survived until the beginning of their first breeding season dispersed. Dispersers either moved into other pre-existing territories (68%), established previously unoccupied territories (21%), or became non-territorial satellites (11%). Dispersal was male-biased with 93% of juvenile males and 64% of juvenile females dispersing. Female dispersers most often moved to neighbouring territories whereas male dispersers moved further away. At the beginning of their first reproductive season females that remained on their natal territories produced significantly more offspring than those that dispersed. Natal dispersal occurred during the first 5 months of life. The first breeding occurred in the following spring. During the period when dispersal occurred, aggressive interactions were uncommon among juveniles or between adults and juveniles. During 87 30-min observation periods, only 15 aggressive interactions were counted, only one of which was initiated by a member of the natal territory. All possible 26 pairs of opposite-sex littermates occupied different territories at the beginning of their first breeding season; In conclusion, natal dispersal in wild rabbits was not caused by aggression. Animals left the natal site on their own volition and settled down where no close relatives were present. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID TIT PARUS-MAJOR; BIRD SONG; MELOSPIZA-MELODIA; SEXUAL SELECTION;
   RECOGNITION; SIMILARITY; CHOICE
AB A male song sparrow, Melospiza melodia, has a song repertoire of about eight or nine distinct song types, and he typically shares several of these song types with each of his several neighbours. In the prevailing theoretical view, the song types in a bird's repertoire are interchangeable and multiple song types exist primarily to provide diversity. The present study was designed to test a contrary hypothesis concerning one particular context, counter-singing between neighbours. Specifically, the hypothesis was tested that song sparrows reply to the songs of particular neighbours with particular songs from their repertoire: they select a song type they share with that neighbour ('repertoire matching'). In a field experiment, neighbour song was played to the subject from just inside the neighbour's territory. Subjects responded with a song shared with that neighbour in 87.5% of trials (chance expectation for this sample is 42%). In control trials, where stranger song was presented from the same location, subjects responded with songs shared with the neighbour at that location in only 17% of the trials. It is suggested that 'repertoire matching' may be one advantage of a song learning strategy that produces song sharing between neighbours. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ID RHESUS MACAQUES; MONKEYS
AB This study investigated whether pigtail macaque mothers encourage their infants' independent locomotion by increasing distance from them and displaying a retrieval signal, the pucker face. Fifteen mother-infant pairs living in a large captive social group were focally observed during the first 12 weeks of infant life. Mothers puckered to their infants only when out of contact with them, and the pucker was followed by reduction in distance by the mother or the infant. The pucker was significantly associated with an increase in distance initiated by the mother, and mothers that frequently puckered to their infants were also those that frequently left them. Multiparous mothers puckered to their infants more than primiparous mothers. The infant's initiative in reducing distance after the pucker increased with its age, and the latency of its response gradually decreased in the first 6-7 weeks of life. Infants that received more puckers from their mothers spent less time in contact with them and approached and left them more frequently than infants that received fewer puckers. The evidence is insufficient to assess unequivocally whether developmental changes in infant responses to the pucker reflect social learning or maturation of motor skills.

AB Theoretical models suggest that begging may signal nestling need. 'Need' for food can be either short term (hunger) or long term (amount of food required to hedge, which may be influenced by body condition, sex or rank in the brood). Studies have shown that begging carries information about short-term need, but have not provided evidence that begging can carry information about long-term need. Signals of long-term need may be unstable if larger chicks out-compete their needler siblings. This study investigated whether nestling yellow-headed blackbirds beg according to long-term need in field and laboratory experiments. In yellow-headed blackbirds, smaller nestlings, males and chicks in poor condition should value food more highly. When hunger level was controlled, males and chicks in poor condition begged more than females and chicks in good condition, respectively, and chicks begged more when paired with larger rather than smaller nestmates. In yellow-headed blackbirds, even when nestmates have unequal competitive abilities, begging can carry information about nestling long-term need for food.

AB Hummingbirds' responses to the spatial distribution of their food were examined using arrays of visually identical feeders in the laboratory. Rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, learned to visit profitable feeders in square arrays of 64 feeders on a wall in which only half contained food and the only source of information about feeder quality was location. Birds learned quickly and well if profitability was simply patterned. They learned more slowly but eventually reached high performance on complex patterns, especially if feeders were regularly distributed. Memory of pattern accounted for much more of performance on all patterns than either simple movement rules or memory of individual locations. When food distributions were switched to their mirror images after birds had reached asymptotic performance, all birds that had performed well before the switch continued for several trials to visit the feeders they had visited before the switch, lagging in redistributing effort to match the new pattern. It is suggested that in the absence of visible correlates of feeder quality, hummingbirds use coarse-grained memories of the spatial patterning of energetic profitability to guide their foraging. These memories develop with repeated experience of environments, develop more quickly in simply patterned environments and persist despite changes in food distribution. Poorer performance in complex arrays is inconsistent with a fine-grained model in which birds remember point sources of food independently. Persistence of foraging patterns at the cost of significantly reduced gross food intake and severely reduced net intake after pattern switches demonstrates that hummingbirds rely greatly on memory of profitability in guiding foraging; however, their quick recovery to previous performance shows that they quickly modify their memory of places on the basis of new information. These results are compared with some recent field studies of hummingbird foraging in which use of memory could not be reliably demonstrated, or was only one of several mechanisms underlying foraging patterns.

AB The implications of 'helpers at the nest' for a male's willingness to remain loyal to his female in a monogamous mating system where successful reproduction depends on biparental care are considered. Three possible types of helpers are distinguished: (1) immatures who remain in their natal groups to act as helpers until they can acquire breeding territories of their own, (2) adult males who act as non-breeding satellites on other males' territories in order to inherit a female and (3) coalitions of males who defend access to a female and mate polyandrously. Observed migration rates for males are too low to make the first hypothesis a viable strategy if males are seeking to maximize their fitness, and the third hypothesis is weakened by the fact that males neither transfer as alliances nor do so into groups where they are likely to have a close male relative. The satellite hypothesis seems to predict the observed behaviour of;callitrichid males best. Variation in callitrichid mating systems may be related to environmentally determined differences in fecundity and mortality rates in different habitats. The high costs of reproduction in thermally stressed environments seem to bias adult sex ratios in such a way as to predispose younger males to pursue a satellite strategy. The presence of satellites willing to help rear the female's offspring in exchange for future breeding opportunities makes roving-male polygyny both a viable and a profitable strategy for older breeding males. This produces an unstable mating system in which groups are likely to oscillate between monogamy, polygamy and polyandry in just the way observed among callitrichids.

AB Selection on traits conferring enhanced mating success, and thus favoured through sexual selection, may be opposed by selection imposed by predators. This study compares determinants of reproductive success in two species of freshwater amphipods, Hyalella spp., that differ substantially in adult body size and other life-history traits, and occupy ecologically dissimilar habitats. The small-bodied ('lake') species occurs in a lake with size-selective fish predators, and experiences increasing mortality with increasing body size. The large-bodied ('marsh') species inhabits a fishless marsh, and experiences decreasing mortality with increasing size. Although male reproductive success increased with body size in both species, the form and degree of the relative mating advantage for large males appeared to differ between species. In the marsh species, male pairing success increased throughout the range of variation in male body size. In the lake species, small males had lower pairing success than males of intermediate and large sizes, but large males did not have greater pairing success than males of an intermediate size. Female reproductive success (through fecundity) increased with body size similarly in both species. Positive assortative mating by size was weak in the marsh species, but stronger in the lake species. Species also differed in the intensity and form of sexual selection acting on the size of male gnathopods, a pair of sexually dimorphic appendages. In the marsh species, sexual selection favoured larger gnathopod width (relative to body size) throughout its range of variation, but no sexual selection for gnathopod width was detected in the lake species. Species differences in the relative importance of large body and gnathopod size in males may reflect an evolutionary divergence in mating behaviour stemming from species differences in countervailing mortality selection.

TI THE INFLUENCES OF LANDMARKS ON DISTANCE ESTIMATION OF HONEY-BEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID ROUTE-BASED MEMORIES; MAPS; ORIENTATION; INSECTS
AB Honey bees, Apis mellifera, were trained to fly from their hive to a feeding site along a flight path marked by visually discriminable landmarks 3.46 m high. The landmarks were placed at regular intervals of 90 m. During training, the feeder was located directly in front of the third (target) landmark. In the tests, bees were given the choice of landing at the trained distance or at the target landmark which had been displaced to a different distance. Bees preferred to land at the target landmark when the discrepancy between the two indicated distances was small, but landed mostly at the trained distance if the discrepancy was large. Furthermore, distance estimation depended on landmarks encountered during flight. When the target landmark was placed at a distance from the hive closer than the trained distance, the bees' readiness to respond to this landmark could be increased only if bees had already passed the landmark that preceded the target landmark during training. Thus, a given flight goal is defined in the bees' memory by its distance from the hive, landmarks that mark the goal, and landmarks that precede the goal during flight. At the same time, the bees, as a group, exhibited considerable flexibility to land in places that were defined by only one or two of these cues.

AB Recent models of the social transmission of behaviour by animals have repeatedly led their authors to the counterintuitive (and counterfactual) conclusion that traditional behaviour patterns in animals are often not locally adaptive. This deduction results from the assumption in such models that frequency of expression of socially learned behaviour patterns is not affected by rewards or punishments contingent upon their expression. An alternative approach to analysis of social learning processes, based on Staddon-Simmelhag's conditioning model, is proposed here. It is assumed that social interactions affect the probability of introduction of novel behaviour patterns into a naive individual's repertoire and that consequences of engaging in a socially learned behaviour determine whether that behaviour continues to be expressed. Review of several recently analysed instances of animal social learning suggests that distinguishing processes that introduce behaviour patterns into the repertoires of individuals from processes that select among behavioural alternatives aids in understanding observed differences in the longevity of various traditional behaviour patterns studied in both laboratory and held. Finally, implications of the present approach for understanding the role of social learning in evolutionary process are discussed.

AB Investment in current reproduction should be balanced against future reproduction. Thus, the allocation of resources during a breeding season is a trade-off between the needs of the parent and the needs of the offspring. Life-history theory predicts the trade-off point to favour the parent in long-lived species and the offspring in short-lived species. To investigate parent-offspring conflict in a long-lived species, the cost of flight was manipulated (by reducing wing span) in Leach's storm-petrel, Oceanodroma leucorhoa. The effect of the manipulation on adult nutritional condition was measured using ptilochronology and the effect on offspring nutritional condition was measured by tracking chick growth. No difference was found in nutritional condition between treatment and control parents. Treatment chicks gained mass more slowly and spent a greater proportion of nights without being fed by either parent. As predicted for a long-lived species, when faced with an increased cost of parental care, the storm-petrel parents apparently shunted that cost to their offspring. These results are compared with previous studies of long- and short-lived species in which parental costs were artificially increased.

AB The importance of androgens in the ability of male lizards to acquire a territory was tested by determining whether male brown anoles, Anolis sagrei, treated with the anti-androgen, cyproterone acetate (CA), were less successful in acquiring a 'high-quality' habitat patch in an outside enclosure than placebo-treated males of similar size. The habitat patch had a tree for perching, ornamental plants and twigs for refuge, and three females for mating partners. Reproductively active males were treated for 21 days with either CA (0.1 mg/day) or placebo, both delivered from subcutaneously placed pellets. On day 21, a CA-treated male and a placebo-treated male were placed into the enclosure (6.0 m(2)). Two hours later, the behaviour and location of the males were monitored for a 30-min period. In tests of 20 pairs, significantly fewer CA-treated males headbob displayed to their male pair-mate, showed the static display modifier of crest erection, and courted females than placebo-treated males. In addition, CA-treated males spent significantly less time in the high-quality habitat patch and less time perched on the tree than did placebo-treated males; they also had significantly less time of exclusive use of these areas. Males treated with CA also perched lower in the habitat than did placebo-treated males. These results suggest that androgens may play an important role in the ability of male A. sagrei and perhaps other lizards to acquire a territory.

AB Previous studies suggest that territories of red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, function as exclusive feeding areas, because prey are limited in availability during rainless periods. To test this idea, males were paired in laboratory chambers under three feeding conditions: (1) termites, a high-quality food resource, (2) ants, a low-quality resource and (3) ants plus termites. Termites are a superior food because they pass through the digestive tract significantly faster and yield significantly higher digestion efficiencies than do ants. Both territorial residents and intruders showed significantly more aggressive behaviour when higher-quality food had previously been fed to the resident than when lower-quality food had been fed to the resident. These data provide evidence that P. cinereus defends feeding territories and that the quality of a territory may be a function of the value of available food resources.

AB Previous experiments have shown that, after a rat Rattus norvegicus has eaten a food for several days, it is resistant to social induction of a preference for that food. The present experiments demonstrate that this inhibiting effect of individual experience of a food on social induction of preference for that food is transitory. Seven days after rats had last eaten a food, they exhibited socially induced preferences for that food as strong as the socially induced preferences exhibited by rats that had never eaten the food. These laboratory results suggest that the combined effects of personal and social exposure to foods should result in free-living rats exhibiting particularly pronounced socially induced preferences both for totally unfamiliar foods conspecifics are eating and for foods others are eating that a focal individual has not eaten recently.

AB It has been suggested that the symmetry of sexually selected characters may be assessed by conspecifics in the context of mate choice. The length symmetry of the long ornamental tail feathers of male paradise whydahs was manipulated in a pair-wise mate-choice aviary experiment to test whether female paradise whydahs preferred symmetrical male ornaments. Asymmetrical tails were produced by elongating one rectrix and shortening the other so that the tail had the same average length and area as symmetrical model tails, but with an asymmetry of 15%. Female paradise whydahs did not prefer the symmetrical tail treatments and instead preferred males when they had the asymmetrical treatment, possibly because asymmetrical tails appeared longer. Manipulating tail asymmetry had no detectable influence on male behaviour. These results are not consistent with the findings of other studies that show male symmetry is preferred by females and suggest that the issue of how birds perceive the length of asymmetrical tails may be crucial for ornament manipulation studies.

AB In anurans the properties of individual males' calls can change markedly during a single bout of calling. Females will therefore be confronted with an array of signals that change in relative attractiveness over time and, consequently, may be stimulated to approach several males before initiating amplexus. This would increase the time spent in the chorus and therefore, the costs associated with finding a mate. These costs may be minimized if, at some point of 'decision', a female's response to a male becomes irreversible, such that any subsequent changes in dynamic call features are ignored. To test this females were presented with two identical calls in a leader-follower call pattern and then the timing of the calls after the initiation of a response to the preferred leader was switched. If call timing was switched when females were within 2 m of the leader, they changed course and tracked the source of the leading call. However, when calls were switched when females were 2 m away, only some females changed course. A second experiment tested whether females 'lock into' static features such as dominant frequency. When a high frequency leading call was switched to a follower and a low frequency call to a leader, females tracked the source of the leading call, disregarding call frequency. The tendency was weaker when a high frequency follower was switched to a leader. The idea that the initiation of a response to a male renders females less responsive to more attractive calls that may arise is not supported.

AB The data reported in this paper illustrate the importance of incorporating elements of naturalistic contexts into experimental design and how the failure to do so can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding behavioural plasticity in a communication system. The slow repetition rate of the notes of the mallard, Anas platyrhynchos, maternal alarm call is the primary acoustic feature affecting freezing (vocal and locomotor inhibition) in ducklings. Previous experiments indicate that alarm calls with notes pulsed between 0.8 and 1.8 notes/s are particularly effective in promoting behavioural inhibition in domestic mallard (Peking) ducklings reared and tested individually. In light of field observations, the ineffectiveness of repetition rates slower than 0.8 notes/s was surprising and might possibly have been caused by species-atypical rearing and testing contexts. Thus, in the present study, Peking ducklings were reared and tested socially to alarm calls that had their notes temporally altered such that the repetition rates fell outside the range normally effective for non-social ducklings (0.2 and 2.6 notes/s). Compared with ducklings reared and tested individually, the incidence of freezing by social ducklings was significantly greater at 0.2 notes/s and was comparable to the level of freezing to such slow-rate notes on nests in the field. There were no differences in freezing between social and individual ducklings at 2.6 notes/s. These data reconcile a discrepancy between held observations of alarm-call responsivity and certain laboratory tests and show that repetition-rate specificity can be altered as a function of rearing and testing context. Furthermore, the observed change in repetition-rate specificity is specific to a form of stimulation that ducklings normally encounter on natural nests (i.e. slow-rate notes). These and other data illustrate that context can be an overwhelmingly important, although often neglected, variable in behavioural and neural research.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

   EVOLUTION; CANNIBALISM; DIMORPHISM
AB Observations on the reproductive behaviour and polygynous mating system of an endemic shell-brooding cichlid fish, Lamprologus callipterus, revealed that territorial males actively transported and accumulated spawning substrate (empty gastropod shells) to make nests. In contrast to conventional resource defence polygyny, males of this species can therefore create a defensible resource distribution. Females successively visited the nests, chose one shell, spawned the whole clutch inside the shell and stayed inside until the young became independent. Males were freed from direct parental care but defended the territory. Nest usurpation by larger males and frequent shell stealing among males were observed; these resulted in cannibalism of the young fathered by the former males. Large males accumulated more shells and consequently monopolized more females than did smaller males. Maximum size of females was apparently limited by the size of available shells, resulting in extreme sexual dimorphism. Extreme polygyny in this species, associated with intense intra-sexual competition and extreme sexual dimorphism, was based mainly on transportability of spawning substrate and the specific behavioural competence of males to use it.

TI SOCIAL CORRELATES OF INDIVIDUAL SPATIAL CHOICE IN FORAGING GROUPS OF
   BROWN CAPUCHIN MONKEYS, CEBUS-APELLA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Individuals in a foraging group of wild brown capuchin monkeys choose different spatial positions relative to the rest of the group. Markov analysis of sequences of individual spatial positions demonstrated significant differences between individuals, which could be categorized a posteriori into four homogenous subgroups. An individual''s spatial position was related primarily to the amount of aggression it received from the group''s dominant male, but also varied with its sex. Spatial choice varied which changes in an individual''s social status, but did not vary consistently with seasonal differences in food availability. These results support the hypothesis that individuals compete for preferred spatial positions within a foraging group.

TI ATTENDING TO BEHAVIOR VERSUS ATTENDING TO KNOWLEDGE - EXAMINING MONKEYS
   ATTRIBUTION OF MENTAL STATES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The ability of monkeys to attribute mental states such as ignorance to each other was examined in two experiments using four captive groups of Japanese and rhesus macaques, Macaca fuscata and M. mulatta. In the first experiment, females were shown food or a predator, either in the presence of their offspring or alone, to determine whether they would attempt to alert ignorant offspring more than knowledgeable ones. The behaviour of mothers appeared to be unaffected by the knowledge of their  offspring. In the second experiment, a juvenile offspring of a dominant female was isolated in an enclosure with a normally subordinate adult female while the juvenile''s mother sat nearby behind either a glass barrier, an opaque barrier or a one-way mirror. In the mirror condition, the two subjects could see the mother, but she could not see them. The behaviour of subjects under the mirror condition was intermediate between that under the glass and opaque conditions. Subjects were probably  sensitive to the mother''s orientation and attentiveness, but there was no evidence that they recognized the difference between their own visual perspective and that of the mother.

TI STARLINGS EXPLOITING PATCHES - THE EFFECT OF RECENT EXPERIENCE ON
   FORAGING DECISIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Laboratory and field experiments have shown that, as predicted by the marginal value model, starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, stay longer in a food patch when the average travel time between patches is long. A laboratory analogue of a patchy environment was used to investigate how starlings responds to rapidly fluctuating changes in travel time in order to find out the length of experience over which information is integrated. When there was a progressive increase in the amount of work required to  obtain successive food items in a patch (experiment 1), birds consistently took more prey after long than after short travel times; travel experience before the most recent had no effect on the number of prey taken. Such behaviour does not maximize the rate of energy intake in this environment. The possibility that this is the result of a simple constraint on crop capacity is rejected as, when successive prey were equally easy to obtain up until a stepwise depletion of the patch (experiment 2),  birds took equal numbers of prey per visit after long and short travel times: the rate-maximizing behaviour. A series of models are developed to suggest the possible constraints on optimal behaviour that affect starlings in the type of environment mimicked by experiment 1.

TI A TEST OF THE SEQUENTIAL ASSESSMENT GAME - FIGHTING IN THE CICHLID FISH
   NANNACARA-ANOMALA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many species have a repertoire of behaviour patterns that are used in contests over resources. It is likely that the function of these behaviour patterns is the assessment of asymmetries between contestants in physical variables (e.g. size or strength). Theoretical models of fighting behaviour such as the war of attrition and the hawk-dove game do not incorporate any behavioural mechanisms allowing assessment, and, therefore, yield no predictions about the use of behaviour patterns. In a sequential assessment game, on the other hand, the assessment of asymmetries is a major activity during a fight. Recently, a version of the sequential assessment game with several behavioural options has been developed, and here predictions from this model are tested using data from 102 staged fights between males of the cichlid fish Nannacara anomala. The model predicts that the sequence of behaviour patterns in a fight should be maximally efficient in assessing relative fighting ability.  Specific predictions are that (1) the sequence should be organized into phases consisting of one or several behaviour patterns with constant rates of behaviour within a phase, (2) the division into phases should be independent of relative fighting ability, and (3) contests with great asymmetry in relative fighting ability should end in an early phase, whereas matched individuals may proceed through a series of escalations reaching a final phase of more dangerous fighting. The results show that the fighting behaviour of N. anomala is rather well predicted by the model.

TI SPATIAL MEMORY OF PARIDAE - COMPARISON OF A STORING AND A NONSTORING
   SPECIES, THE COAL TIT, PARUS-ATER, AND THE GREAT TIT, P-MAJOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The performances of the coal tit (a food storer) and the great tit (a non-storer) were compared in two experiments in which the bird was rewarded in phase 2 of a trial for returning to sites where it had seen food in phase 1 (''window-shopping''). In both experiments the differences in performance between the species were small. In the first experiment the storing species was better than the non-storer at returning to the site where it had seen a seed, and in the second experiment the storing species was better at discriminating in phase 2 between sites visited in phase 1 that contained a seed and sites visited in phase 1 that were empty. A third experiment demonstrated that the motivational variables of reward size and deprivation were unlikely to account for the difference between the species. The results might indicate that there are differences in the spatial memory of the storing and non-storing species, but a difference in perceptual discrimination cannot be excluded.

TI THE BEHAVIOR OF GRAY JAYS, PERISOREUS-CANADENSIS, TOWARDS PALATABLE AND
   UNPALATABLE LEPIDOPTERA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Grey jays were fed a set of six species of lepidopterans, predicted to be palatable or unpalatable based on their coloration and the fate of ingested host plant allelochemicals. Each of four birds received the entire series of insects. Juronia coenia (Nymphalidae) and Ceratomia catalpae (Sphingidae) were highly palatable as predicted based on their relatively cryptic coloration and lack of chemical defence. Three Euphydryas (Nymphalidae) species were predicted to be unpalatable: larvae and  adults are warningly coloured and they sequester iridoid glycosides. However, Euphydryas gillettii was quite palatable, E. anicia was intermediate and E. phaeton was unpalatable. These differences may be due to differences in the iridoid glycoside content of these butterflies. Eumaeus atala (Lycaenidae) sequesters cycasin from its hostplant in the Cycadaceae and larvae and adults are warningly coloured. Adult E. atala were unpalatable.

TI PREFERENCE OF MONGOLIAN GERBILS FOR SALIVARY CUES - A DEVELOPMENTAL
   ANALYSIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The capacities of Mongolian gerbils, Meriones unguiculatus, of different ages to discriminate between samples of saliva drawn from their known or potential social partners were examined using simultaneous two-choice preference tests. In the first experiment, weanling gerbils (24-27 days old) were attracted equally to saliva of either parent when presented concurrently, but exhibited a strong preference for their mother''s or father''s saliva when paired with unfamiliar parental saliva.  Experiment 2 revealed that female juvenile gerbils (40-50 days old), but not males, prefer same-sex sibling saliva. Neither juvenile females, nor males, showed a significant preference for saliva drawn from siblings and non-siblings of the opposite sex. As adults (90-100 days old), males and females are preferentially attracted to saliva from non-siblings of the opposite sex. Salivary stimuli may serve as chemosignals to help conspecifics make discriminations along biologically relevant  dimensions and, perhaps, to promote contact between appropriate social partners at important periods in ontogeny.

TI INFANTICIDE BY MALE AND FEMALE HOUSE SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Of 211 breeding attempts of house sparrows, Passer domesticus, 9-12% were affected by successful or apparently attempted infanticide. Among males, infanticide appeared to be committed by territorial individuals that had recently lost their mates. Since there was a large population of female floaters, such males had access to mates, suggesting that intrasexual competition for mates was not a necessary precondition for male infanticide in this population. Infanticidal males bred with the  females whose chicks they killed sooner than replacement males than refrained from infanticide. Females that mated with bigamous males lost eggs and nestlings due to infanticide by females more frequently than did monogamous females. Moreover, primary females (the only ones assisted by the male) tended to suffer from infanticide by females more often than did secondary females. This suggests that females commit infanticide in order to monopolize paternal investment.

TI PHENOTYPIC SIMILARITIES OF SIBLING ZEBRA FINCHES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Four phenotypic attributes of male zebra finches were investigated to determine if observed variability predicts relatedness. Traits studied included three secondary sexual traits (bill colour, breast band and throat stripes), and one species-specific character (eye stripes). To score similarities, two series of pairs were created, with half of all pairs containing same-clutch siblings, the other half non-siblings (r .ltoreq. 1/8). Siblings were found to be more similar than non-siblings with  respect to eye and throat stripe attributes, but not with regard to breast band size and bill colour. A human observer predicted which sets contained siblings with considerable accuracy. Results suggest that family resemblances for some visual traits are sufficiently great that they could be used by zebra finches in the process of phenotype matching. In birds, visual similarities may be more reliable indicators of relatedness than auditory similarities, due to the important role of learning in  the acquisition of bird song.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS ON FIGHTING IN FLIGHTLESS MALE FIG WASPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two evolutionary models, one predicting reduced fighting costs with increased relatedness between rival males, and the other predicting fighting costs as a function of the interval between challenges for mating opportunities, were tested with data from Malaysian fig wasps. The cost of fighting was assessed by numerical rating of injuries, enabling an index of fighting severity to be calculated for each of 25 species. Male relatedness was determined indirectly throught the degree of bias in the sex ratio. It was assumed that the rate of challenges for mating opportunities with a receptive female was related to male density. Contrary to prediction, fig wasp species with female-biased sex ratios, and therefore high relatedness, did not have reduced injury levels. The lack of an agreement was attributed to a difference in the way fighting costs are allocated in evolutionary models and the way they are obtained in real populations. When fighting costs are associated with an increased variance in male reproductive success without a decrease in average reproductive success, as they are in fig wasps, then high levels of relatedness may not lead to less intense fighting. A curvilinear relationship, with a peak in the cost of fighting at an intermediate density of males was predicted. Among fig wasps species, injury level declined with increasing density of males per fig-receptacle (syconium). Fig wasp species that entered the syconium to oviposit had high male densities and particularly low injury scores. It is suggested that species with this mode of life history were predisposed, by the associated high density of males, to the evolution of intense sperm competition and low injury levels. The injury level also declined when the density of males as low, as predicted, but the trend was apparent only between syconium-populations within species.

TI SEXUAL SELECTION AND INTRA-FEMALE COMPETITION IN THE GREEN POISON-DART
   FROG, DENDROBATES-AURATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Observations on the mating and parental behaviour of the green poison-dart frog were used to test two hypotheses for the function of female-female competition in this species. The hypothesis that females compete to monopolize as many mates as possible was not supported because: (1) male territoriality was associated with competition for females; (2) intra-female competition for mates was not more common or intense than intra-male competition; (3) females were more selective about mating than were males; (4) estimated offspring production by individual females did not exceed the parental capacity of a single male. The hypothesis that females compete to monopolize the parental care of particular males was consistent with observations that: (1) females competed for males, but were more selective about mating than were males; (2) females remained near particular males and attempted to keep other females from mating with those males; (3) females may have used courtship to prevent males from mating with other females. Both hypotheses were consistent with evidence that: (1) females are large compared with males in D. auratus, relative to closely related species with low male parental investment; (2) females destroyed the eggs of other females when they located them.

AB Most knowledge of the mechanisms underlying parental behaviour in mammals is derived from studies of maternal behaviour. Male parental care and its proximate causation has been less well studied. The maintenance of paternal and maternal behaviour in the biparental California mouse was investigated by moving the pups and/or mate on the day of birth and testing parents individually on day 3 or day 5 postpartum for 10 min with a 1- to 3-day-old alien pup. Pup presence maintained maternal responsiveness care. In contrast, presence of the mother maintained paternal responsiveness. Direct physical contact between mother and father was not necessary for maintenance of paternal behaviour. Maternal excreta were sufficient to keep fathers parental.

TI THE VALUE OF FOOD - EFFECTS OF OPEN AND CLOSED ECONOMIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experiments in which animals work for food can be classifed as involving either an open economy or a closed economy. In a closed economy, an animal''s interaction with its enviroment determines how much food it obtains, whereas in an open economy the intake is determined in part by the experimenter. In this paper these economies are modeled by allowing the animal to allocate its time to various activities including foraging. Maximization of reproductive success involves a trade-off between  starvation and predation, and this is used to predict the amount of time devoted to the various activities. The optimal proportion of time spent foraging, .mu.*, depends on the rate, g, at which food can be obtained. This dependence is investigated and it is shown that in the model of the open economy .mu.* increases with g, whereas in the model of the closed economy .mu.* decreases with g. The decrease in .mu.* during an open economy experiment (''satiation'') is also explored. The comparison of behavior in open and closed economies leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the economies as experimental procedures. A general conclusion is that open economies are more suitable for studies of foraging behaviour, and closed economies are more suitable for time allocation studies when activities other than foraging are also important.

TI POLYGYNY IN THE PIED FLYCATCHER, FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA - A TEST OF THE
   DECEPTION HYPOTHESIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The deception hypothesis has been proposed as an explanation for polygyny in the pied flycatcher. According to this hypothesis, already-mated males hide their mating status with polyterritorial behaviour and thereby increase their chances of obtaining a second mate. In a study area at Oslo, Norway, secondary females raised 84% as many fledglings as did concurrent monogamous and primary females. The unmated males sang most of the time near their nest site, whereas the already-mated males frequently disrupted singing for longer periods in their secondary territories to visit their primary nest; such visits to the primary nest occurred both before and after the time of their second mating. The behaviour of the males suggests that deception of females is not an evolutionarily stable strategy, as an observant female would soon discern the male''s status. Another difficulty with the deception hypothesis is that secondary females laid larger clutches than primary females. The number  of young fledged from secondary nests was not dependent on the distance to the primary nest. The deception hypothesis was not supported by the data, and the reduced reproductive success of secondary females may be explained by the cost of searching for a mate.

TI CONTESTS BETWEEN LARVAL DAMSELFLIES - EMPIRICAL STEPS TOWARD A BETTER
   ESS MODEL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Some hypotheses about facultatively aggressive interactions among damselfly larvae (Odonata: Zygoptera) have recently been generated from a model (Crowley 1984) based on the theory of evolutionarily stable strategies(ESS). The present study tests some of the assumptions and predictions of this ESS model with larvae of the damselfly Ischnura elegans van der Lind. in two sets of laboratory experiments. In contest experiments, interactions between two larvae on a thin dowel were observed in all possible combinations of the final three instars. The tendency to maintain control of the site and to evict the opponent was positively related to hunger, relative size(instar difference), and aggressiveness (labial striking), but negatively related to advancing toward a similar-sized opponent along the dowel. Contests were longer and involved more physical contact when larvae were more similar in size. No injuries or mortality resulted from the observed encounters. In distraction experiments,  individual larvae were placed in a small feeding chamber with daphnid prey. Experimental larvae were surrounded by last-instar larvae visible through clear plastic walls; controls had no surrounding larvae. Time spent staring at others carried a feeding cost. This cost, the observed negative-exponential distributions of contest duration, and the apparent rarity of dangerous aggression, suggest that contests between similar-sized larvae could be considered wars of attrition. Other possible  interpretations and some implications of these behaviour patterns for vulnerability to other predators are noted.

TI KIN AND SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN SPLENDID FAIRY-WRENS - RECOGNITION BY
   SONG IN A COOPERATIVE BIRD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Cooperatively breeding splendid fairy-wrens, Malurus splendens, were tested with songs recorded from individuals of known social and kin relationships. Both males and females sang and responded aggressively to songs of wrens from other social groups. Wrens responded similarly to songs of non-kin and songs of close kin in the absence of social familiarity with them. Breeding females responded more intensely to songs of helpers from other groups than to songs of helpers in their own group. The songs of male and female helpers elicited similar responses by breeding females. The response to other females may be associated with competition for breeding status and helpers. Two females sometimes breed in social groups with two older females; no interference was observed. Song may allow individuals to recognize other wrens in their group and to direct their behaviour towards non-dispersing relatives by location and social familiarity rather than by kinship identifiers.

TI THE EFFECTS OF FEMALE CHOICE AND MALE MALE COMPETITION ON THE MATING
   SUCCESS OF MALE GUPPIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study examined the effects of female choice and male-male competition on male mating success in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. The fraction of a male''s displays that elicited a sexual response from a female was used as a measure of relative female preference for that male. Male mating success was measured by scoring paternity of sons, using colour pattern as a genetic marker. Female preference had a significant effect on male mating success. Male-male competition was relatively uncommon, and did not involve direct threats or combat. Data on male-male competition did not significantly predict mating success. Males from different experimental groups with the same colour pattern had similar mating success. This suggests that female choice could have been based on colour pattern. However, there was no obvious relationship of particular colour pattern elements to mating success or female preference. The males with the same colour pattern were related and most were reared together, so other genetic or environmental factors could have led to similar mating success.

TI SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN KITTIWAKE COLONIES - SOCIAL FACILITATION AND OR
   FAVORABLE SOCIAL-ENVIRONMENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A video study of social facilitation was carried out on a kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla, colony. For the analysis, the video sequences were divided into adjacent periods of 15 s. The temporal limits of each behaviour could thus be defined and its length taken into account. There were significant differences between the behaviour of neighbouring birds during the mating of a pair and that shown at other times. A comparison of the frequencies of behaviours shown by neighbouring birds during the  two alternating stages of mating (Mounting and Copulation) permitted two kinds of behaviours, which differed during mating, to be distinguished. (1) The behaviours that differed between Copulation and Mounting reveal the reaction of the neighbouring birds to Copulation (but no evidence of social facilitation could be found). (2) The behaviours that differed only between Mating sequences (case sequences) and other sequences (control sequences) had probably started before the mating started. Consequently, the temporal clustering of activities in colonies may be due to the effect of particular behaviours which could favour the appearance of certain other behaviour. This mechanism (Favourable Social Environment) can act simultaneously with social facilitation. It raises the possibility that social environment may influence greatly the production of young in colonial birds.

TI THE EFFECTS OF TRICHINELLA-SPIRALIS INFECTION ON SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN
   MIXED GROUPS OF INFECTED AND UNINFECTED MALE-MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The presence of Trichinella spiralis infection in groups of male mice caused behavioural changes in both infected and uninfected mice. Also, for some behaviours, the extent of behavioural change in infected mice appeared to be determined by the number of muscle larvae they harboured. Infected mice showed a reduced frequency of exploratory and social behaviours compared with uninfected mice while uninfected mice performed more social investigatory activities towards those that were infected. Social interactions between infected and uninfected mice were also affected by familiarity. Behavioural differences shown to result from infection in mice familiar with each other were similar but more pronounced when the mice were unfamiliar. These results suggest that other factors may influence the behavioural effects of parasites on their hosts. For some behaviours, the greatest alterations in behaviour apparently caused by infection coincided with the period of infectivity to another host. The significance of this in relation to parasite transmission is considered.

TI FOOD CALLING IN THE DOMESTIC-FOWL, GALLUS-GALLUS - THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL
   REFERENTS AND DECEPTION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Gallinaceous birds give food calls in association with tidbitting behaviour. The use of this vocalization by males in male-female interactions was studied by observing pairs of domestic chickens, Gallus gallus, under semi-naturalistic conditions, concentrating especially on the hypothesis that the cell refers to an edible object and can be used deceptively. Of all calling, 45% occurred when no identifiable object was present. When food was present variations in calling rate were related to food quality but not to the occurrence of waltzing or variation in inter-mate distance. Also, calls given when no edible object was present occurred when the female was significantly further from the male than when food was present. The results are consistent with a referential interpretation, with food objects as a referent. The responses of hens to calling with and without edible objects are consistent with the assumption that the male can use food calling deceptively, but do not exclude alternative explanations.

TI PLUMAGE COLOR AND SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE PIED FLYCATCHER
   FICEDULA-HYPOLEUCA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The plumage colour of male pied flycatchers varies on a continuum from brownish and female-like to a conspicuous black-and-white. Males have a conspicuous plumage only during the breeding season, when the mortality rate was low and not correlated with plumage colour. Brownish males breed successfully, and breeding males had no lower annual rate of return than non-breeders. Experiments on male intrusion showed that possession of a cryptic, female-like plumage did not facilitate nest site settlement by such males. Dark males were on average older, arrived earlier, and defended more nestboxes than brown males. However, experiments showed that plumage colour was not a reliable indicator of the outcome of competitive combats between males. These facts argue against several existing hypotheses about variation in male plumage colour. A new explanation is proposed: a bright colour serves to signal presence and thereby reduces territory holding costs. The brownish males arrive only  shortly before the females and thus will not benefit as much by being conspicuous as do the black-and-white males that arrive earlier in spring.

TI 2 METHODS FOR QUANTIFYING THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOMINANCE HIERARCHIES IN
   LARGE GROUPS WITH APPLICATIONS TO HARRIS SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Two new methods for quantitatively describing behavioural processes of hierarchy formation in large groups are introduced. These methods supplement those already available with the jigsaw puzzle approach to hierarchy formation (Chase 1980, 1982, 1985) and they examine behavioural sequences in component triads, subgroups of three individuals, making up the larger group. The first method gives a new procedure for counting various kinds of attack sequences in component triads, and the second traces how relationships evolve in triads. Used together, the procedures can help explain the development of dominance structures, and in particular, what kinds of interactions produce those that are linear or near-linear. The methods are illustrated by applying them to large flocks of Harris'' sparrows, Zonotrichia quereula, having 12-17 members, during hierarchy formation. This application indicates that different behavioural mechanisms may be involved in hierarchy formation for large and small groups and that some configurations of interactions in triads are much more stable than others, namely, transitive ones are much more resistant to reversals than intransitive ones. These findings suggest that earlier and later interactions may not be independent and raise a number of interesting questions about individual-level mechanisms operating during hierarchy formation.

TI THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL-DOMINANCE BETWEEN 2 SUBSPECIES OF DARK-EYED
   JUNCOS, JUNCO-HYEMALIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Experiments with captive dark-eyed juncos showed consistent patterns of social dominance between the sexes and between two subspecies. Carolina juncos, Junco hyemalis carolinensis, are altitudinal migrants of the southern Appalachians and dominate latitudinally migrating northern juncos, J. h. hyemalis, that are sympatric in winter. In matched-pair competition trials, Carolinas clearly dominated northerns when sex and size were controlled. Carolinas also dominated northerns in all-male flocks. Two series of observations on flocks containing both sexes of both subspecies showed that males dominated females within subspecies and Carolinas dominated northerns regardless of sex. Dominants had greater access to spatially limited food and longer feeding times than subordinates. Compared to controls that had more food and less competitive interference, subordinates in flocks appeared less able to store fat, especially in harsh weather. Considering these results and parallel field studies, it is suggested that social dominance is an important component in explaining patterns of altitudinal distribution found in these subspecies in winter.

TI SEXUAL-RESPONSE OF FEMALE YELLOWHAMMERS TO DIFFERENCES IN REGIONAL SONG
   DIALECTS AND REPERTOIRE SIZES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female yellowhammers, Emberiza citrinella, a common Eurasian songbird, were tested in the laboratory for their sexual response to male songs from two different dialects and to three different repertoire sizes (one-three). In the first experiment, the females responded with significantly more copulation solicitation displays when played their home dialect from Norway than when played a dialect from Denmark. These two dialects also occur in adjacent populations. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that females mate assortatively with males of the their own dialect in natural populations. Previous work on yellowhammers suggested an adaptive explanation for assortative mating. In the second experiment, the females responded with significantly more copulation solicitation displays when played a repertoire of two or three song types than when played a single song type. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that sexual selection has been involved in the evolution of enhanced repertoire size in songbirds.

TI THE CLOSED ENVIRONMENT OF THE FIG RECEPTACLE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON MALE
   CONFLICT IN THE OLD-WORLD FIG WASP, PHILOTRYPESIS-PILOSA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The influence of the environment on the fighting behaviour and susceptibility to injury of male Phylotrypesis pilosa, a parasitic fig wasp, was examined with reference to a recent model of contest competition. The model was extended by deriving an expression for the overall rate at which contest costs accumulate during resource exploitation. Predictions were then made about the cost and frequency of fights, and about the overall cost of fighting with regard to variations both in the density  of males and females and in the ratio of females to male competitors. The cost of fighting was estimated from the length and frequency of fights and by the extent of male injuries. The overall cost of conflict was highest at an intermediate density of males, as predicted. The overall cost also rose as the density of females increased but, unexpectedly, did not peak at an intermediate female density. A predicted relationship between fighting cost and the ratio of female number to male competitor  number was also missing. These discrepancies were associated with a difference in the actual and assummed form of sperm utilization that followed mating, and with the surprising ability of males to alternate rapidly between guarding and exploratory behaviours. The data give no indication that males are either reducing their levels of aggression in fights with relatives, or increasing them to establish dominance when encountering the same competitor repeatedly.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF HELP IN CONTESTS ON DOMINANCE RANK IN PRIMATES - HINTS
   FROM GORILLAS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a number of primate species, daughters have a dominance rank adjacent to their mother''s, and younger sisters dominate older ones. The acquisition of a dominance rank largely independent of body size has been related to the reception of help in contests. This paper concentrates on a three-stage process. (1) Vulnerable individuals are helped in contests. (2) The more successfully helped individuals challenge and, with help, eventually dominate less successfully helped ones who are relatively  close to them in size. (3) The rank so acquired is reinforced by continued help after dominance is achieved. This hypothesis is substantiated by data from two groups of wild gorillas. In them, only the first stage of help occurred: 94% of incidents were to protect vulnerable kin. Lacking the second two stges, dominance rank remained closely proportional to body size. Help in contests increases the complexity of calculations of asymmetry in competitive ability. Since such help is far more  commonly seen among primates than non-primates, it is possible that it was a main selection pressure in the evolution of primate intelligence.

TI THE SOCIALITY OF SOLITARY FORAGERS - A MODEL BASED ON RESOURCE
   DISPERSION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Under versions of what may broadly be called the Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH) several authors have concluded that territory size and group size are limited respectively, and independently, by the dispersion and richness of patches of food. This paper presents a model that shows how the frequency distribution of resources available per unit time within a territory may permit the formation of groups even in the absence of any functional advantage to any individual from the presence of  another. In this model, animals (called primary occupants) occupy territories containing sufficient resources to meet or exceed their requirements for a critical proportion of feeding periods. The availability of these resources is described in terms of their mean richness and their heterogeneity, and plots of these parameters indicate the circumstances within which individuals may share the minimum territory with the primary occupants. The model shows how, under plausible conditions of  resource dispersion, a territory that provides almost total food security for two occupants could also provide, at no cost to the original occupants, substantial food security for an additional group member, even if it never used the same food patches as the originals. It is not therefore, as is sometimes supposed, a necessary condition for the RDH that members of a group often forage simultaneously in the same patch. Thus the model describes ecological circumstances whereby groups could evolve  amongst species whose members neither forage communally, nor even meet frequently.

TI CHANGES IN THE RHESUS MOTHER INFANT RELATIONSHIP THROUGH THE 1ST 4
   MONTHS OF LIFE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Measurements of the course of interactions between rhesus monkey infants (Macaca mulatta) and their mothers during the infant''s first 16 weeks showed changes in the tendencies of both partners to be together and apart. Referring only to the partner who was primarily responsible for an age-related change, by using a single index of responsibility for contact or proximity, was found to be an oversimplification. Maternal rejecting behaviour may have been primarily responsible for changes in the time spent apart only during the first 6 weeks. After the infant''s sixth week, both partners'' tendencies to be apart increased together. Infants then began to spend longer away partly to interact with social companions other than their mother. Mothers restricted and followed their infants more up to week 4, but after week 8 decreases in these measures allowed infants to spend longer away. Similarities between the time courses of the time spent apart from their mother by rhesus infants in this study and in field studies are pointed out. The similarities seem striking partly because differences between studies that do not use confidence intervals (or standard errors) cannot be shown easily. Conflict between parent and infant occurred, but how it appears, and how significant it is in each species at each infant age, remains to be discovered.

TI SITE INFIDELITY IN SONG SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In each of 4 years of study of a breeding population of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) approximately two-thirds of the males holding territories at the beginning of the breeding season had abandoned those territories before the end of the breeding season and overall 83% of those males were never seen again. Males were more likely to abandon a territory following a nest failure but some individuals left after a success and some remained after a failure. Indirect evidence suggested that  territory quality also influenced a male''s decision to stay or go. Data on nesting success suggested that both birds that stay or those that move benefit from their actions. Between years, males showed the same lack of site fidelity, but were more likely to return to a territory on which they had been successful. Females also showed little site fidelity within breeding seasons, and although they abandoned territories for the same reasons as males, they appeared to move independently of their mate. Only one of 146 birds banded as a nestling was ever resighted as an adult. Together, the low adult site fidelity and low natal philopatry indicate a much higher level of outbreeding than has been estimated previously for this species. We discuss the implications of these results and propose that, rather than being an evolved attribute to maintain an optimal level of inbreeding, site fidelity is a conditional strategy related to intraspecific competition for territories.

TI A PROBLEM FOR GAME-THEORY ANALYSIS - ASSESSMENT AND INTENTION IN MALE
   MOUTHBROODER CONTESTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB With conditions of residency and recent experience held constant, staged contests between males of the Mozambique mouthbrooder, Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters) were settled on the basis of size. Contest length wa snot correlated with the degree of size asymmetry, and giving-up time was apparently random, although the contests were not wars of attrition. Contest intensity was found to decrease as size disparity increased. Contrary to the predictions of game theory, eventual winners and losers of encounters were found to show significant differences in the frequencies of several behavioural measures, even in the early part of the contest. It is suggested that there are circumstances where there may be costs as well as benefits resulting from the concealing of intentions.

TI PREFERENCE FOR UNFAMILIAR SIBLINGS OVER FAMILIAR NON-SIBLINGS IN
   AMERICAN TOAD (BUFO-AMERICANUS) TADPOLES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Kin recognition may involve comparisons between conspecifics'' traits and one''s own or those of known genetic relatives. In American toad (Bufo americanus) larvae, association patterns appear to reflect this phenotype matching'', based, in part, upon traits of familiar conspecifics. To examine whether socially-reared tadpoles might additionally use their own traits in making such discriminations, individuals were tested in a Y-maze apparatus for their tendencies to discriminate between waterborne cues released by their unfamiliar siblings and by familiar non-siblings. Six of seven test groups spent more time oriented toward their unfamiliar siblings than toward familiar non-siblings, but the difference was significant for only two of these groups. Overall, 84 subjects oriented toward siblings and 51 toward non-siblings. thus, in some circumstances, toad tadpoles appear to recognize siblings based on shared recognition traits rather than on prior social experience with  conspecifics.

TI RELATIONSHIPS OF VERVET MOTHERS WITH SONS AND DAUGHTERS FROM ONE THROUGH
   3 YEARS OF AGE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Social relationships between mothers and juvenile offspring were examined in captive, socially-living vervet monkeys (C. a. sabaeus) to assess the effects of offspring age and sex, and the mother''s dominance rank on behavioral interactions. Both high- and low-ranking mothers approach and groom their daughters more than they approach and groom their sons. The frequency of both aggressive behavior toward offspring and support of offspring in agonistic encounters with other group members is influenced by the mother''s dominance rank, but not by offspring sex. Compared to sons, daughters (particularly daughters of high-ranking females) approach and groom their mothers more often, and support their mothers more often in intra-group aggression. The results are discussed in terms of several predictions from parental investment theory and the concept of mutualism.

TI A POSITIVE FEEDBACK MODEL FOR SWITCHING BETWEEN 2 ACTIVITIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A model is described for the alternation between 2 activities. Each activity has an associated tendency, and the model performs the activity with the higher tendency. The tendencies depend on both negative and positive feedback from the performance of the activities. The behavior of the model is periodic, with bout durations that depend on the ratio of the maximum response rates. Increasing the maximum rate of a behavior increases the magnitude of its bouts. The behavior of the model is similar in several respects to the model developed by Ludlow (1980), which suggests that it may not be easy to distinguish between various models of feeding and drinking behavior.

TI BEHAVIORAL AND ENDOCRINE RESPONSES OF FEMALE MICE TO SYNTHETIC ANALOGS
   OF VOLATILE COMPOUNDS IN MALE URINE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The urine of intact, adult male mice elicits more investigatory sniffing from female mice than does the urine of castrated males. When either of two androgen-dependent urinary compounds, 2-sec-butyldihydrothiazole or dehydro-exo-brevicomin are added to castrate urine, its relative attractiveness remains the same. When both compounds are added to castrate urine, however, its activity is enhanced and the castrate urine becomes as attractive to females as whole, intact male urine. Females exposed to the reconstituted ''normal'' urine for 3 min per day, displayed more frequent estrous cycles. The two synthetic compounds are synergistic in the context of castrate urine, producing an olfactory message that behaviorally and physiologically mimics the activity of the normal biological signal.

TI PARENTAL CARE AND THE ONTOGENY OF PREDATOR-AVOIDANCE IN 2 SPECIES OF
   CENTRARCHID FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Stamps (1978) suggested that the type and extent of parental care can influence the behavioral ontogeny of the offspring. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) males guard the fry for up to a month after they leave the nest while rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) males guard the fry only until they leave the nest. In laboratory experiments, naive largemouth fry displayed reduced predator-avoidance responses to large and small predators during the first 3 wk of free-swimming. Rock bass  fry, on the other hand, avoided predators throughout the study period. From 6 wk (largemouth) and 5 wk (rock bass) of age the fry showed a significantly greater response to the large predator than the small predator. The responses of laboratory-reared largemouth bass fry to the small predator changed from avoidance to association as the fry grew. The size of the fry relative to predator size was important.

TI COMMUNICATION IN THE COURTSHIP OF A MADAGASCAN HISSING COCKROACH .2.
   EFFECTS OF DEANTENNATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The role of the antennae in courtship was studied by removing the antennae bilaterally from both male and female cockroaches, which were then paired with intact animals. These experimental pairings were compared with each other and with pairings of normal animals. Significant deviation from normal behavior occurs in both the deantennated and the intact members of experimental pairs. When males are deantennated and paired with intact females the timing of courtship is prolonged and male  cockroaches misdirect many of their copulation attempts. Under these conditions the intact female cockroaches perform some behaviors more frequently, in particularly mounting and palpation. When deantennated females are paired with intact males, very little courtship ensues. Thus information important to the progress of courtship probably is provided by both antennal inputs and antennal movements, and the cockroaches are probably capable of some behavioral flexibility when deprived of this information.

TI SCENT-MARKING IN THE TAMARIN, SAGUINUS-OEDIPUS - SEX-DIFFERENCES AND
   ONTOGENY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many mammalian species which exhibit scent-marking behavior show a pronounced sexual dimorphism in marking behavior and scent gland morphology. Several species of marmosets and tamarins do not show dimorphism in these traits. Sex differences in scent-marking structures and behavior were examined in cotton-top tamarins (S. o. oedipus; Primates: Callitrichidae). While body size and weight were virtually identical in adult males and females, there were pronounced sex differences in scent gland size and in rates of marking behavior. Females possessed larger anogenital and suprapubic glands and showed 10-fold higher rates of anogenital marking and slightly higher rates of suprapubic marking than males. Observations on the development of anogenital marking revealed a lack of dimorphism during the 1st 2 yr. Adult rates of anogenital marking in females were only observed in females housed separately from their natal family group. The onset of adult levels of marking behavior corresponds with the adoption of the role of a breeding adult female, suggesting that  anogenital marking plays a role in sexual communication.

TI FACTORS INFLUENCING THE WATER SPEED OF SWIMMING SEA HARES,
   APLYSIA-BRASILIANA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Swimming data for A. brasiliana, a gastropod mollusk, were studied to determine what variables influence water speed (i.e., the velocity of travel relative to the water mass). Water speeds varied from 2.5-14 m/min. Water speed was primarily correlated with current aspect (i.e., the angular difference between the animal''s heading and the current direction) and the relationship was strongest at high current speeds. This relationship is termed the thrust modulation response (TMR). High waves caused significant underestimation of water speed and high waves also detracted from TMR clarity for other reasons. Water speed was not significantly correlated with release number, current speed, current component, wave component, water depth or sun aspect. Although considerable variance in water speed was not accounted for by the variables studied, it is clear that future field experiments on mechanisms underlying the TMR should be done when current speeds are high and wave heights are low.

TI RESPONSE OF THIRSTY RATS TO ABSENCE OF WATER - FRUSTRATION,
   DISINHIBITION OR COMPENSATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Water-deprived rats were allowed to drink in an experimental chamber during a series of training trials and were then presented with an empty water sprout during a single test trial. Their initial response to absence of water was to bite, sniff and paw at the empty spout (spout-directed behavior), after which they engaged in activities such as eating, grooming and exploration of the chamber. By comparison with control animals that had no expectation of water, experimental rats performed these latter activities in a bizarre ''speeded-up'' manner, which was quantifiable as an increase in local rate. Both the occurrence of spout-directed behavior and the increase in local rate of other activities were enhanced by increasing the prior level of water deprivation and by offering a more palatable fluid during training. The results were related to current models of behavioral switching.

TI SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR AND PATERNITY IN 3 CAPTIVE GROUPS OF RHESUS-MONKEYS
   (MACACA-MULATTA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Each offspring born into 3 captive groups of rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) during the spring of 1981 was assigned a most probable behavioral father and a subset of all possible behavioral fathers, on the basis of intensive observations of sexual activity during the 1980 fall breeding season. These predictions were then compared with true paternity determined by electrophoretic and serological analyses of polymorphic blood proteins of mothers, infants, and all adult and subadult males.  Coincidence between the assignments of paternity based behavioral and biochemical data occurred no more frequently than chance would allow. There were no significant relationships between biochemical and behavioral rankings of overall reproductive success. Conventional estimates of sexual activity during the breeding season are not a reliable indicator of true paternity and relative reproductive success in rhesus macaques.

AB The possibility that thermal cues play a part in the teat-seeking behavior of newly-born lambs was investigated. Measurements show that the external surfaces of a lactating ewe vary in temperature, highest readings being obtained from the inguinal cavity at the base of the udder. Experiments show that, before sucking, lambs stay longer in a warm compartment than in a cool one, also that they become more active when their muzzles are placed in contact with a warm smooth surface than they do when placed in contact wiht a cool smooth surface. The activity evoked resembles that of newly-born lambs searching for the teat.

TI A GAME THEORETICAL INTERPRETATION OF MALE COMBAT IN THE BOWL AND DOILY
   SPIDER (FRONTINELLA-PYRAMITELA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male bowl and doily spiders (Frontinella pyramitela: Linyphiidae) fight over access to adult females. The probability of disablement or fatal injury in these contests is a linear function of their duration. Thus, the fights fit closely the assumptions of a version of the game theory war of attrition. Because the details of sperm competition are known, female value (expected number of eggs fertilized) to either a copulating male or an intruder can be quantified for any stage of copulation. The predictions of the war of attrition model were critically examined by experimental manipulation of fighting ability and female value for both web residents and intruders. When female value was equal for both combatants, the ability to win fights was correlated with body size and the duration of contests was inversely correlated with size difference. The winning percentage of males of specific size differences varied directly with female value. The treatments with the highest percentage of injuries and fatalities were those in which a smaller resident was defending a female of great value. In 2 treatments in which larger web residents were contesting for females of low value, the predictions of the model were not supported. However, a quantitative analysis of the treatments shows that these apparently anomalous results are in accord with the model.

TI REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THE GREAT TIT IN RELATION TO ITS TERRITORIAL
   STATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a deciduous woodland plot of 11.7 ha with 118 nestboxes, 46 great tit (P. major) pairs laid eggs in 1980 although only 27 were observed defending a territory inside the plot. The real intruders, those that were not observed to defend a territory anywhere, produced an average of 4.08 fledglings as compared with 8.0 in territorial pairs. The reproductive rate of an intruder was correlated to the distance it nested from the host and to the number of days it laid after the host. The  reproductive rate of territorial pairs was reduced by having an intruder in the territory, especially if the intruder bred at less than 30 m. This effect is significant for clutch size and reproductive rate. No size differences could be detected between the different groups of birds. Nestling weight at 15 days did not vary with parent status nor did post-fledging survival or dispersal. Fitness is estimated for birds differing in territorial status. It is lower for real intruders. Great tits do not defend super-territories and intruding is not an ESS [evolutionary stable strategy]. An hypothesis to explain the density-dependent reduction in clutch size is proposed.

TI MATING-BEHAVIOR OF THE GOLDEN-HAMSTER UNDER SEMI-NATURAL CONDITIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The female is highly aggressive towards the male during days 1 and 2 of the estrous cycle. On day 3 she attracts the male via a trial of vaginal marks concurrent with the display of a submissive tail-up response. This usually results in the 2 animals sharing the female''s nest-box during the day preceding receptivity. When both animals are free to interact throughout the 4-day estrous cycle, lordosis is limited almost entirely (93%) to the female hamster''s living area and 49% of lordosis occurs within the female''s nest box. Following about 60 min of mating, the female drives the male from her area, retrieves his food supply and by aggressive interactions, sequesters the male in the corner of his area most distant from her nest site. When the male and female are first allowed contact after the female is receptive, initiation of interaction occurs when the female first encounters the male. This is usually in the male''s area and 72% of lordosis time occurs in the male''s area.

AB Naturally incubated broods were observed and the behavior of embryos and incubating hens was described. Embryos and hens begin to vocalize the day before hatching and do so more and more often as hatching approaches. An analysis of temporal associations between embryonic and maternal behaviors reveals that specific interactions take place. When an embryo begins to distress call the hen vocalizes or moves on the nest. Following such maternal behavior, the embryo becomes silent or begins to emit pleasure calls. Many of these interactions are like those that occur after hatching. This suggests that interactions between neonates and their parents have antecedents prior to hatching.

   PEROMYSCUS-LEUCOPUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A 2 phase study was conducted with P. l. noveboracensis. In the field, frequency of captures was examined relative to nocturnal cloud cover and moon visibility. No relationships were apparent. In laboratory, preferences of wild-reared mice for opposing visual cues under contrasting levels of illuminance were studied. Mice preferred an illumination equivalent to that striking a field on a clear, moonlit night (0.020 ft-cd) to the average of that striking the forest floor on a cloudy, moonlit night (0.005 ft-cd). At the lower intensity, mice showed no preference between 2 identical boxes placed vertically or horizontally. At the higher level of illuminance, there was a preference for the horizontal box, suggesting a tendency to orient toward horizontal objects over vertical ones at certain light levels. Higher natural nocturnal illuminance is not avoided (and may actually be preferred) by P. leucopus. Vision may be an important sensory modality in orientation and navigation under these conditions.

   FACTORS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A study of temporal trends in forced copulation was conducted in flight-pens with 8 pairs of captive mallards to test the hypothesis that forced copulation is an evolved breeding strategy in waterfowl. Significantly more forced copulation attempts were directed at females during egg-laying than during the non-layig period preceding laying, and few forced copulations occurred after the laying of the last egg of the clutch. Most forced copulations occurred in the morning when the females were leaving the nests after egg-laying. Thus, forced copulations occurred at times when fertilization was most likely to result, supporting the insemination strategy hypothesis.

TI RESPONSES TO ORAL GLAND SCENTS FROM DIFFERENT MALES IN COLUMBIAN
   GROUND-SQUIRRELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Acrylic cubes carrying oral gland scents from strange, neighboring and resident male Columbian ground squirrels (S. columbianus), plus a cube with no scent, were presented near the home burrows of squirrels in the field. Adult males and adult females sniffed scented cubes longer than unscented cubes, sniffed cubes with scent from other (strange and neighboring) males longer than cubes with the resident male''s own scent, and sniffed cubes with scent from strange males longer than cubes with scent from neighboring males. Males also scent-marked the cubes on a number of occasions; differences in the frequency with which the cubes were marked followed the same pattern. Thus adult Columbian ground squirrels probably recognize familiar as opposed to unfamiliar males, and may also be able to determine individual identity, through oral gland scent. An ability to distinguish familiar from unfamiliar males by scent could be advantageous in facilitating differential treatment of wandering strange males vs. established neighbors.

TI SIBLING ASSOCIATION AMONG SCHOOLING TOAD TADPOLES - FIELD EVIDENCE AND
   IMPLICATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The results of recent laboratory studies suggest that the ability to recognize kin may be a widespread phenomenon among diverse animal groups, but the question of how such recognition abilities influence individuals'' behavior under natural conditions has not always been considered. As an assay for sibling recognition, the sibship composition of experimental schools formed by tadpoles of the American toad (B. americanus) was measured in their natural habitat. Sibling cohorts were obtained from amplectant pairs in the laboratory and reared in groups either in separate tanks, apart from non-siblings; or in a common tank, separated from non-siblings by a screen partition across which water could pass. Tadpoles were dye-marked to indicate sibship identity. Pairs of sibling groups were then mixed together in a bucket and released in natural outdoor ponds, where they formed schools. Sibship composition differed significantly among schools in 79% of all sampling periods; overall, 64% of the schools sampled were significantly biased in favor of one or the other sibship. The formation of sibling schools appears to result from a behavioral recognition mechanism rather than from differential habitat selection. Tadpoles preferentially formed schools with familiar siblings over both familiar and unfamiliar non-siblings, suggesting that sibling discrimination is not based on familiarity alone. Although experience may affect the ontogeny of sibling recognition, sibling preferences are apparently formed early in development, perhaps prior to hatching. Grouped individuals may in some situations increase their inclusive fitness by associating with kin: aposematic advertisement, alarm signaling in response to predators'' attacks, and kin-influenced growth regulation are suggested as 3 specific advantages conferred by the formation of sibling schools.

AB Laboratory experiments with yellow-eyed juncos (Junco phaeonotus) indicate that the birds'' foraging preferences for variable rewards respond not only to the mean, but also the variance, of food rewards. The nature of their preferences for variable rewards may be related to their expected daily energy budget. The birds'' preferences in utility functions for energetic rewards are summarized. Since mean reward size is inadequate to predict their behavior, foraging models should consider environmental stochasticity and an animal''s response to this variation.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The egg-laying sequence of the orb-weaving spider N. clavipes was observed in the field setting. The functions of certain modal characteristics of the egg sac were assessed through the collection of normative field data on overwintering egg sacs and through the effects of egg sac manipulations on spiderling production. Components of the egg sac were manipulated before and after egg hatching to determine if they promoted offspring survival at different times in development. Naturally-occurring and induced changes in the position and structure of the egg sac resulted in similar decreases in productivity. Certain components of the egg sac were important primarily before hatching, and others throughout the entire overwintering period. These results and the limitations of functional analyses of behaviors are discussed.

TI FUNCTIONAL-ASPECTS OF PROLONGED PARENTAL CARE IN BEWICKS SWANS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In Bewick''s swans prolonged parental care is important in protecting offspring from feeding competition with other individuals in winter flocks. When separated from their parents, cygnets were less successful in aggressive encounters, were frequently displaced and spent less time feeding than when close to their parents. Parents protected their offspring by intervening in encounters on their behalf. They were able to do so because of their high dominance rank within the flock. Differences in dominance rank among families were correlated with differences in dominance of cygnets both with and away from their parents. Cygnets may assume their parents'' dominance, the effect continuing into the 2nd winter. Parental care involved measurable cost to both parents at the beginning of the winter.

TI THE ONTOGENY OF AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR IN THE BLUE GOURAMI,
   TRICHOGASTER-TRICHOPTERUS (PISCES, ANABANTOIDEI)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of agonistic behavior in the blue gourami, T. trichopterus, was studied from hatching to 4 mo. of age. Larval motor patterns appear first as simple, uncoordinated and irregular movements and gradually become regular and well coordinated, forming integrated complex patterns, e.g., swimming, surfacing and feeding. Most motor patterns used in agonistic interactions are first exhibited in nonsocial contexts. Initial interactions between young fish consist of approach and investigation in a feeding context, in some cases followed by nibbling, biting, and chasing by one fish. Later, initial approaches are separated from biting and chasing by lateral displays, circling, tail beating and fin tugging, and by appeasement behavior that inhibits chasing and biting by the opponent. Agonistic behavior of socially isolated fish, when paired in dyadic encounters as adults, indicates that the role of social experience as an integrator and regulator of social behavior may change progressively during development, and become more important as ontogeny proceeds.

In the presence of an additional model, a live female with a maternal call, ducklings preferred the combined audio-visual model over either of the other 2 stimuli. In tests for preferences between a brood of ducklings and the stimuli associated with the live female, the brood was preferred over either the silent live female or the maternal call. Subjects exposed to the brood and to the female with the maternal call showed an alternation of preference over days, suggesting that these 2 models were more equally attractive than any other combination of stimuli tested.

AB In 2 habitats supporting different densities of breeding oystercatchers, H. ostralegus L., the intensity with which these birds defended central and peripheral parts of their territories was compared. Territiorial birds in both study areas were equally aggressive to intruders landing close to central nests, but birds breeding at the higher density were more aggressive to intruders near the edge of territories than were the low density birds. In the more densely settled area, territories were smaller and more often contiguous with other territories, territorial settlement was more synchronous, and the frequency of intrusions by apparently non-territorial oystercatchers was higher. The level of conspecific pressure for territorial space was an important proximate factor contributing to the marked difference in mean territory size in the 2 areas.

TI EVOLUTION OF HOARDING BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Some simple models of food storing in which it was attempted to identify factors influencing evolution of hoarding behavior are discussed. When an individual stores food in a defended territory, the net benefit derived from hoarding depends on the cost of storing, the probability of recovering a stored item, its food value, and the multiplication rate of non-hoarded items. When hoarders live in a group, an additional cost may arise from cheaters who do not store food themselves but parasitize the caches made by other individuals. Hoarding in this context can be adaptive if a hoarder is more likely than any other group member to recover its own items. This could come about either because individuals remember their own caching sites, or if individuals differ in their preferred foraging sites and cache food in their own kind of place. Conditions for the existence of a stable mixture of hoarders and cheaters in a group are discussed. [Species mentioned are Parus spp., Melanerpes formicivorus, Lycaon pictos, Vulpes vulpes, Canis lupus, Crocuta crocuta, Hyaena hyaena, H. brunnea, Tamiasciurus spp., Nucifraga caryocatactes, N. columbianus and Corvus frugilegus.].

   (COLINUS-VIRGINIANUS, ODONTOPHORINAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sound spectrograms of bobwhite quail separation calls were simplified to graphs of fundamental frequency against time. All graphs shared a common configuration, but the length and fundamental frequency of each section of the call varied from one bird to another. Variation within an individual''s calls was mainly the result of characteristic differences between calls of high and low amplitude. Quantitative analysis showed that the differences between individuals were normally greater than those found within individuals. The separation call could thus form a basis for individual recognition by conspecifics, as well as identifying the species and location of the calling bird. The various quantitative methods that have been used to compare bird vocalizations are discussed.

TI INFLUENCE OF LITTER SIZE AND PARENTAL BEHAVIOR ON DEVELOPMENT OF
   MONGOLIAN GERBIL PUPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Undisturbed pairs of Mongolian gerbils were observed rearing litters of 1, 3 or 5 pups. Pup behavior and physical development were also monitored. Activities of both parents are influenced by litter size; some activities, e.g., sniffing pups, being performed the most with large litters but others, e.g., nest-building, being performed the most with small litters. Pups from litters of 3 show the fastest behavioral and physical development. The presence of the male influences female activities and offspring development. Females nest-build less and sniff the pups less when the male is present. Pups reared with their father open their eyes earlier and are behaviorally more advanced than are pups reared by the mother alone.

TI WOODPIGEON FEEDING-BEHAVIOR AT BRASSICA SITES - FIELD AND LABORATORY
   INVESTIGATION OF WOODPIGEON FEEDING-BEHAVIOR DURING ADOPTION AND
   MAINTENANCE OF A BRASSICA DIET
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Field observations were complemented with laboratory experiments to show how pecking-rate, peck size and crop filling were related in woodpigeons eating Brassicae. Leaf fragments accumulate in their crops while they are feeding; subsequently they rest, digesting the accumulated food, until the crop store is exhausted (experiment III) or some other factor such as feeding by other pigeons (experiment II) induces the start of another feeding bout. Acclimatization to a brassica diet involves changes in feeding behavior, consumption and anatomy over a period of 10-15 days. A comparison between woodpigeon feeding behavior at brassica and clover sites indicates how the limiting rates of ingestion and digestion influence the feeding strategy on each diet.

TI USE OF KAIROMONES BY MEGAPONERA-FOETENS (FAB) (HYMENOPTERA-FORMICIDAE)
   IN THE DETECTION OF ITS TERMITE PREY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Scout ants of the obligate termite predator, M. foetens, respond to cues in fresh soil sheeting laid down by foraging termites by returning to their nests laying a recruitment trail. Effective cues are found in the sheeting of Macrotermes [M. bellicosus and M. subhyalinus] and Odontotermes [O. smeathmani] but not Microtermes and Ancistrotermes [A. cavithorax]. They can be extracted using organic solvent, but have disappeared from the sheeting after about 24 h. Solvent extracts of minor worker termites have the same effect on scout ants as fresh sheeting. The ability of M. foetens to detect fresh soil sheeting may increase the efficiency of predation on Macrotermes and Odontotermes spp. [O. pauperans, Microtermes sp. and Captotermes sp. were also discussed.].

TI SUPERSTITIOUS BEHAVIOR RESULTING FROM PERIODIC RESPONSE-INDEPENDENT
   PRESENTATIONS OF FOOD OR WATER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In 2 experiments with 5 pigeons behavior patterns that developed in association with periodic, response-independent presentations of food and water were studied. In experiment 1, the pigeons were deprived primarily of food or water and given presentations of the appropriate reinforcer on a response-independent, fixed-time 15 s schedule. In experiment 2 the birds were deprived of food and water and studied in a procedure where on a fixed-time 15 s schedule, concurrent access to food and water was provided at opposite ends of a long response chamber. Periodic response-independent reinforcement produced 2 dominant behavior patterns for each subject: interim responses that occurred early in the interreinforcement interval, and terminal responses that occurred later in the interval. Food presentations produced interim and terminal responses that differed among birds but were, highly consistent for each individual bird. Water presentations produced a more limited range of interim and terminal behavior patterns than were observed in most subjects. The terminal behavior indicates that response topographies depend on the nature of the forthcoming reinforcer; the interim behavior suggests differences in how pigeons react to the unavailability of food and water.

TI BEHAVIORAL INTERACTIONS OF INTERSPECIFICALLY TERRITORIAL VIREOS .1. SONG
   DISCRIMINATION AND NATURAL INTERACTIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The patterns of response to advertising song of territorial Philadelphia vireos and red-eyed vireos (Vireo philadelphicus and V. olivaceus) were studied. The red-eyed vireo seems not to discriminate between its song, the song of the Philadelphia vireo and either song with altered syntax. The Philadelphia vireo does discriminate between the 2 naturally occurring songs, and there is evidence that it discriminates the artificial songs from the 2 vireo songs. The structure of the response was also mathematically investigated, and functional consistencies were found. The generality of these results is extended by testing them with data from natural encounters during the breeding season of the vireos. Data are discussed in relation to interspecifically territorial behavior which are consistent with hypotheses of character convergence and social mimicry. Parts of the hypothesis of Murray (1971) that interspecific territoriality is unstable were contradicted, unless all cases of mimicry are assumed to be unstable. Template matching as a fundamental process of avian perceptual activities does not seem powerful enough to explain these data without postulating additional modifying factors.

TI EFFECT OF SOCIALIZATION ON ADULT SOCIAL PREFERENCES IN
   TILAPIA-MOSSAMBICA (SAROTHERODON MOSSAMBICUS) - PISCES-CICHLIDAE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of socialization on the sexual preferences of adult T. mossambica were investigated. Subjects were reared with mother and siblings for the 1st month of life and then with siblings until sexual maturity, with siblings from hatching to sexual maturity, or in social isolation from hatching to sexual maturity. At maturity males were tested with female fish of 4 spp. [T. mossambica, T. melanotheron, Herotilapia multispinosa, Trichogaster trichopterus] to determine the range of species they would court and then were subjected to 2 different preference tests to determine the species they preferred to court. Females were subjected to a ''proximity to male fish'' preference test. All groups of adult fish preferred to court and ''stay near'' conspecific fish, regardless of gender or of previous social experience. Socialization is not needed for adult T. mossambica to recognize and prefer conspecifics.

TI SEX-DIFFERENCES AND DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES IN SELECTED JUVENILE
   ACTIVITIES (PLAY) OF DOMESTIC LAMBS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Play of domestic lambs (Ovis aries) was recorded from birth to 10 wk during 2 lambing seasons. A higher proportion of males than females mounted and butted; females were more likely than males to gambol. No differences were evident between the behavior of females from same-sex twins and females from mixed-sex twins. The ontogeny of play followed a bimodal course, with little play in the 1st week of life, peaks of play during weeks 2-3 and 8-9, and a trough of activity between the peaks. Concurrently circulating hormones probably do not contribute to the sex differences or the development of play in lambs. The ontogeny of play may reflect ancestral adaptations to natural selection.

TI INTERSPECIFIC AND INTRASPECIFIC RESPONSES TO SYNTHESIZED PYGMY MARMOSET
   VOCALIZATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Four different types of trill vocalizations used by pygmy marmosets [Cebuella pygmaea] are acoustically similar to one another and occur in different contexts. Synthetic replicas of these vocalizations and variants along each of the acoustic continua separating them were produced and played to both pygmy marmosets and humans. The marmosets responded to a broad range of variations as equivalent to natural vocalizations, but responded quite differently to variants of some calls used in different contexts. This was analogous to the ''categorical perception'' that humans show with speech sounds. Humans made finer discriminations among all of the synthesized marmoset sounds and showed no perceptual boundaries between them. Humans differ from marmosets in their perceptual responses to these functionally different sounds is a mechanism that could ensure an accurate reception of a signal by a recipient despite variations due to specific individuals or environmental noise.

   AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB Territorial behavior of R. clamitans was studied in an experimental pond containing natural vegetation and artificial shelters. Males defended territories from June-Aug. Five vocalizations were used in territorial advertisement and agonistic encounters. Agonistic behavior including patrolling, splashing displays, chases, attacks and wrestling. About 23% of all encounters ended in wrestling bouts. Most bouts were less than 30 s long, but some lasted up to 45 min. Most fights were won by residents. Intruders were most successful in fights when they were larger than residents or previously were residents of other territories. Possible costs of fighting include energetic costs and exposure to predation. Large male body size in R. clamitans and other territorial frogs may be an adaptation for fighting.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Pigeons were trained to make conditioned responses from which their ability to make discriminations relevant to sun-navigation and their use of alternative navigational information derived from the sun could be judged. Using an artificial sun, discrimination thresholds determined for absolute altitude and azimuth, rate-of-change of altitude and azimuth and time of day were compatible with certain hypotheses of sun-navigation. Experiments in which pigeons were trained to respond in the homeward direction, either under an artificial sun in the laboratory or under the real sun in field conditions, provided support for some components of sun-navigation only. These results are discussed in relation to recent evidence that pigeon navigation utilizes other types of cue.

DT Article
AB Data from a series of generalization experiments measured the degree of similarity, perceived by the honey bee [Apis mellifica] between a training shape and each of a set of test shapes. It was possible to predict the observed degree of similarity from measurements of certain parameters of the shapes. The important parameters were shape area and the ratio between the length of outline of a shape and the area it encloses (contour density), so that loge (percentage of responses to the test shape) was a linear function of 1/(C.D.tr - C.D.te) (Atr - Ate) where C.D.tr is the contour density of the training shape, C.D.te is the contour density of the test shape, Atr is the area of the training shape and Atc is the area of the test shape. Mechanisms by which the bee might measure these parameters are discussed.

AB Mated pairs of the shrimp S. hispidus were given a series of tests in which individuals were temporarily isolated from conspecifics and subsequently re-paired with either their previous mate or a stranger. Each stranger was a conspecific of the same size, sex and apparent appearance as the test individual''s previous mate, but an animal with which the test individual had no previous experience. Individuals behave differently when re-paired with previous mates than when re-paired with strangers, indicating that S. hispidus can distinguish previous mates from other conspecifics. S. hispidus is capable of individual recognition, a capability previously demonstrated in several vertebrate species but only a few invertebrates. In S. hispidus chemical stimuli are the most probable basis for individual recognition.

Cotton swabs rubbed on the face and cheeks of females but not males elicited ultrasonic calls from males. Female vaginal odors probably also elicit calls. Males will also emit ultrasounds in response to female but not male urine. The source and chemical nature of this ultrasound-releasing pheromone remain to be discovered.

TI EFFECTS OF PRE-TEST CONDITIONS ON SOCIAL FACILITATION OF DRINKING IN
   DUCKS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The drinking and sieving of Khaki Campbell ducklings were used as suitable behavior patterns with which to study the social interactions in flock-living birds. Ducklings from 4-bird flocks were deprived of water for 3 h, either in isolation or in groups of 4. When the flocks were allowed access to water the isolated ducklings drank less than the non-isolated ducklings. While both deprived and non-deprived birds engaged in sieving activity during the test, the sieving movements of the non-deprived birds were of longer duration than those of the deprived birds. Pre-test isolation of flock members also increased the duration of sieving movements. Re-introducing the isolated ducklings to each other for the last 5 min of deprivation failed to eliminate the difference in either the drinking or the sieving behavior between the isolated and non-isolated birds. The difference in drinking, but not sieving, could be eliminated by reuniting the birds for the last 30 min of deprivation. The disruption of flock cohesion may lead to the failure of the mechanism of social facilitation despite a similar motivational condition in all flock members.

TI SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND ANTIBODY TITERS IN YOUNG MALE CHICKENS
   (GALLUS-DOMESTICUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The influence of social interactions on established antibody titers to a Salmonella pullorum antigen was determined in several Athens Randombred families. In 2 experiments, a large-bodied, aggressive family and a small-bodied, relatively non-aggressive family were placed in 3 social environments: 4-bird control groups with no changes in membership once formed; 3-bird resident groups to which a new 4th bird was introduced daily; and the single bird moved to a new group each day. The normal rate of decline in antibody titers was significantly accelerated in birds introduced as new members daily, but only in members of the small non-aggressive family. In experiment 3, using families relatively close in size and aggressiveness, the effects of social grouping on antibody titers were not significant.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Groups of dogs aged 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age were studied in a standard delayed response test procedure; 2 food-reward boxes which were switched randomly and a neutral box were used. Responses to incorrect and neutral boxes and maximum delay times up to 13 days after initial shaping were evaluated. Delay times increased with increasing age, with the exception of the 16 week old group; similarly, responses to the neutral and incorrect boxes decreased with age with the exception of this group. These findings are discussed in relation to the development of internal inhibition andare correlated with other aspects of CNS and behavioral development in this species.

TI ACOUSTIC INTENSITY LIMENS IN GOLDFISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Thresholds for acoustic stimuli and discrimination limens for different acoustic intensities were obtained in the goldfish, Carassius auratus. The method used was avoidance conditioning and the staircase audiometric technique. Mean thresholds ranged from -25 dB (re 1 [mu]b) at 50 Hz, to -46 dB at 500 Hz, and -2 dB at 2000 Hz. The practical limit of hearing was at 3000 Hz with a threshold of +22 dB. These thresholds were all significantly above the ambient noise level in the test tank. Goldfish were capable of discriminating the intensity of 2 pure tones when the difference was from 3 to 6 dB in acoustic pressure. Over a dynamic range of 30 dB the discrimination limens did not change significantly. The limen was smallest in the 300 to 400 Hz range, and the upper limit of any discrimination was at 1500 Hz. Comparisons of these data with the hearing capacities of other fishes and of mammals show both quantitative and qualitative differences.

TI ALTERATION OF SEX-TYPICAL BEHAVIOUR OF HAMSTERS IN OPEN FIELD AND
   EMERGENCE TESTS BY NEO-NATAL ADMINISTRATION OF ANDROGEN OR OESTROGEN
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female hamsters ambulate more in the open field and emerge more quickly from a box than males. An attempt was made to determine whether these behavioral sex differences can be influenced by the presence of certain steroid hormones at a critical period of development. Hamsters of both sexes were given a single dose of either 300 [mu]g testosterone propionate or 150 [mu]g estradiol benzoate on the 2nd day of life; control animals received the oil medium only. Oestrous cycles failed to appear in either androgen or estrogen treated females, and their ovaries did not contain corpora lutea. Their behavior in both the open field and the emergence test was similar to that of males. The behavior of males was not affected by either hormone. Comparison with results from previous experiments suggests that early handling may increase ambulation in both sexes. It may be concluded that in the hamster the presence of androgens oroestrogens during the neonatal period acts on the developing CNS so that when adult, not only gonadotrophin secretion, but also behavior not directly associated with copulation follows the male pattern.

AB An experiment to select active and inactive strains of Drosophila is described. After 25 generations of selection highly significant differences between the experimental and control lines were produced. An estimate of heritability for spontaneous activity was obtained from the regression of offspring on midparent, this value of h2 was 0.51 [plus or minus] 0.10. At S26 the activity of the experimental and control lines was measured in 3 different kinds of apparatus. Significant differences between the populations were obtained from each measure. These differences were all in agreement with the measure employed in the selection procedure.

   SELECTIVELY BRED FOR DIFFERENCES IN ACQUISITION OF A CONDITIONED
   AVOIDANCE RESPONSE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rats of the 8th generation of a strain selectively bred for high or low performance in the establishment of a conditioned avoidance response were subjected to procedures designed to highlight differences in either or both reactivity and spontaneous activity. Factor analyses of both sub-group as well as combined group scores indicated that the major difference between the sub-strains lay in differences in activity rather than reactivity. The factor structure of the sub-groups differed considerably. Rank order correlations between factor loadings in the 3 groups led to the conclusion that the low avoidance group (poor conditioners) provided the greater proportion of the variance of an emotionality factor of the combined group but there was little difference between the subgroups on a similar assessment of the activity factor.

TI MATERNAL BEHAVIOUR IN VIRGIN FEMALE GOLDEN HAMSTERS - CHANGES CONSEQUENT
   UPON INITIAL CONTACT WITH PUPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Initial contact with pups of a certain age causes changes in virgin female hamsters'' behavior with pups of another age. This was shown by comparing the behavior with 5-day-old pups in groups of naive (control) animals and of animals given one previous contact either with l-,5-, or 9-day-old pups. Maternal responses were more intense in the animals previously presented with 1- or 9-day-old pups than in the control animals. Attacking was increased after initial contact with 1-day-old pups and decreased after initial contact with 9-day-old pups. Animals presented twice with the same pattern did not show marked changes in either of the 2 activities.

TI EFFECT OF SENSORY DEPRIVATION ON BEHAVIOUR OF POLYCHAETE NEREIS IN
   T-MAZES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Decerebration of Nereis diversicolor that have previously been trained in a T-maze results in a return to random choices at the junction of the maze. Experiments were designed to test whether this is due to the disruption of sensory discrimination at the junction, or to interference with a memory storage or retrieval process. So long as some anterior sense organs are retained, worms can be trained or, if previously trained, continue to perform normally. Deprivation of sensory input from all major anterior sense organs results in a loss of previously learned behavior and a return to random choices; but naive, deafferentiated worms are able to learn the maze in even fewer trials than intact control worms. Disconnection of the supraesophageal ganglion and Its sensory input (from eyes, palps and antennae) from the rest of the nervous system, leaving nervous connection between the tentacular cirri and the ventral nerve cord intact, has no effect of learned behavior in 5/10 worms. Sensory deprivation, rather than loss of a memory store, appears to be an important factor leading to the loes of learned behavior when the supraesophageal ganglion is removed.

TI RELATIVE EFFECTS OF TESTOSTERONE AND NORTESTOSTERONE ON RUNNING ACTIVITY
   OF CASTRATED MALE RATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Groups of castrated Osborne-Mendel male rats were injected with either testosterone cyclopentylpropionate or nortestosterone cyclopentylpropionate or oil. Although the effect of the testosterone was significant in that it increased the amount of running compared with castrated control rats, this was due primarily to the increase exhibited by rats that had manifested relatively high levels of pre-castrational activity. Nortestosterone failed to affect the running activity. Consequently, when androgen affects running behavior, it is through mechanisms that are correlated with its androgenic actions.

AB Pirate spiders do not construct webs to capture their prey. Instead, they feed on other web-building spiders, which they attack by walking cautiously on the silk lines of their webs. Here we describe the capture web and attack behaviour of the pirate spider Gelanor siquirres. The capture web consists of long, dry silk lines that the spider lays downwards from its retreat to the nearby vegetation, as night falls. These lines serve as substrate for silk lines (floating lines) of other nocturnal spiders that begin web construction during the same period. If an exploring spider attaches its floating line to the silk line of the pirate spider's web, then the exploring spider walks along its line to the pirate spider's line. As the pirate spider perceives the exploring spider on its web, it descends from the retreat and attacks the exploring spider. Both the capture web and the attack behaviour of G. siquirres are part of a previously unknown, likely novel foraging strategy in pirate spiders.

AB Animal personality may influence the foraging behaviour of animals. The state-behaviour feedback hypothesis suggests that variations in personality that drive foraging strategies may be influenced by their physiological states. Appetite hormones, such as leptin and ghrelin, play a crucial role in regulating the host's foraging behaviour. In addition, the digestive tract is essential for the digestion and absorption of nutrients, which is related to feed efficiency and the host's foraging behaviour. However, the potential role of appetite hormones and digestive tract morphology as the basis for personality-driven foraging behaviour remains unclear. Thus, in this study, we used the Chinese three-keeled pond turtle to investigate how the boldness-exploration personality syndrome affects food intake and its association with morphological traits, hormones and digestive tract morphology between different personality types. We found a positive link between boldness-exploration personality and physiological state; bolder and more explorative turtles had higher food intake, lower stomach and intestine mass along with shorter stomach and intestine. However, no differences in morphology and serum leptin and ghrelin concentrations were found between these two personality types. Our results indicate that personality could affect foraging behaviour probably because of its association with digestive tract morphology. These results provide new evidence of behavioural-physiological adaptation mechanisms in animal personality, suggesting that personality-related foraging behaviour may covary with the physiological state. Individuals with different personalities may adaptively adjust their foraging behaviour based on their digestive tract morphology. These associations may lead to individual dietary specialization and contribute to achieving a potentially similar fitness expectation of different personalities in nature.

AB Species recognition can be interpreted as the identification of sexual compatibility among individuals, which is related to the assessment of partner quality. This compatibility can be assessed using visual signals of conspecifics such as body coloration. Fiddler crabs constitute a group with a global distribution, comprising over 100 species with diverse colours. They perceive these body colours and use them for intersexual communication, primarily through signalling of the hypertrophied claw of males. However, few species have been investigated regarding the role of body coloration as a species-specific signal, and it remains unknown whether other body regions, such as the carapace, convey information about individual quality or species identity. Hence, this study aimed to examine whether carapace coloration of two sympatric fiddler crab species (Leptuca leptodactyla and Leptuca cumulanta) affects species recognition. To do this, we used individual females of L. leptodactyla that were subjected to a binomial choice of males with claws and carapaces reflecting different colours, simulating conspecifics (L. leptodactyla) or heterospecifics (L. cumulanta). We observed that females were unable to distinguish conspecifics from heterospecifics using only claw colour. On the other hand, we discovered that the white carapace coloration of L. leptodactyla was crucial for females to identify conspecific males. This is the first study to demonstrate that carapace coloration of male fiddler crabs functions in species recognition, reinforcing the idea that body traits beyond sexual ornaments can influence animal communication, affecting species identity and/or mate selection.

AB Assessing social effects on individual behaviour is challenging because knowledge of an individual's social environment is often difficult to gain, especially for animals that form dynamic social groups. We here report on an experiment where the social environment could be manipulated. To this end, we capitalized on the availability of populations of migrant and resident sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, that exhibit strong differences in movement tendencies. This allowed us to create mixed shoals with different proportions of migrants and residents, to investigate the occurrence of social effects between migrant and resident fish. In a mesocosm consisting of linearly connected ponds, we found that the overall movement patterns, as quantified by the number of pond transitions, remained consistently higher in migrants than in residents, regardless of the social group composition. The fish's intrinsic movement tendency was the main predictor of the observed variation between populations. However, at the start of the experiment, when social effects were expected to be strongest, residents were more likely to leave the starting pond in the presence of migrants than in their absence. As this increase in movement tendency was not related to the frequency of migrants in the mixed groups it cannot solely be ascribed to social conformity. Additionally, we found an effect of being part of the majority on movement: the first fish to leave the starting pond was almost always a member of the majority group (be it migrants or residents). In conclusion, we found little evidence for social modulation of movement based on differences in the populations' movement tendencies, but rather an effect of being in a majority group.

AB Animals' learned vocalizations often show high levels of intraspecific variation, and different variants may play different roles in attracting mates and settling territorial disputes. In any animal population with variable vocalizations, certain acoustic variants may be common and others rare. The responses of animals to local versus nonlocal sounds have been well characterized in prior investigations, but few investigations have explored the reactions of animals to songs that are present at different frequencies of occurrence within a population. Using an experimental approach to investigate a breeding population of Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, we tested the responses of territorial male songbirds to playback of locally common songs, locally rare songs and heterospecific songs. Male sparrows showed strong responses to conspecific song but weak responses to heterospecific song. Males showed their strongest responses to locally common songs and weaker responses to locally rare songs. Birds did not appear to discriminate between playback songs based on whether they were of the same song type as their own. We suggest that male Savannah sparrows perceive locally rare songs as weaker threats than locally common songs, similar to birds' reactions to foreign dialects. This could be due to low familiarity with locally rare songs, reduced female preference for locally rare songs, decreased success with territory defence for males singing locally rare songs or other perceived differences between locally rare and locally common songs. Overall, our results suggest that different song types elicit different responses from territorial songbirds, even songs that are found within the same population with different frequencies of occurrence.

AB Caching food for later retrieval is vital for many animals' survival, but little is known about how this behaviour varies among individuals in the wild. If individuals consistently differ in where, when and how they store food, it could indicate that caching is subject to selection. In this study, we experimentally quantified the repeatability and relationship between different aspects of caching behaviour over two winter seasons in a wild population of toutouwai, Petroica longipes. Individuals were repeatable both within and between years in the number of cache sites they created, the distance they travelled to cache and food item handling time prior to caching. All three of these caching behavioural measures were positively correlated with one another, suggesting that toutouwai exhibit a caching syndrome analogous to a behavioural syndrome, with individuals ranging between 'clump caching' and 'scatter caching'. The number of food items that birds ate prior to caching and latency to begin cache retrieval were also consistently correlated, indicating a second 'fast - slow' syndrome linking cache retrieval to satiation level. In both syndromes most individuals were normally distributed between the behavioural extremes, indicating that birds tended to partake in intermediate caching rather than clustering at either end of the continuum. We posit that this distribution may be the result of stabilizing selection that balances the costs and benefits of each extreme. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Hyperparasitoids are ubiquitous components of terrestrial food webs. They must find their inconspicuous parasitoid host in a complex environment to generate offspring, but their foraging behaviour is poorly understood. Herbivore -induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) induced by parasitized caterpillars have been found to be exploited by hyperparasitoids in the cabbage system. However, the naturally occurring presence of nonhost organisms can interfere in HIPV production. It is unknown how hyperparasitoids respond to this source of variation in their foraging behaviour. We studied how the presence of nonhost herbivores affected foraging decisions of the hyperparasitoid Lysibia nana. In Y -tube olfactometer bioassays, we compared the preference of hyperparasitoids for volatiles from cabbage plants induced by single herbivory (host or nonhost), dual herbivory (host thorn nonhost) or uninfested cabbage plants. Following this, we conducted a common -garden experiment to study whether preferences observed in the laboratory are also apparent in the field. We found that L. nana preferred plants that were induced by its host, Cotesia glomerata-parasitized Pieris brassicae caterpillars. However, the volatiles of nonhostinduced plants hampered the hyperparasitoids' ability to locate host -induced plants in the Y -tube olfactometer. In particular, HIPVs induced by the nonhost caterpillar Mamestra brassicae in both single and dual herbivory hampered the hyperparasitoids' ability to locate host -induced plants. The presence of other nonhost herbivores feeding simultaneously on the same plants as host -containing herbivores did not interfere in L. nana's preference. In the field, hyperparasitoids could locate their host despite nonhost presence. Overall, these results indicate that host location errors by hyperparasitoids may occur during HIPV-guided foraging steps, which can be corrected by using more reliable cues after landing on the plant. This demonstrates the ability of higher trophic level organisms to exploit the scarce amount of available information to locate their host.

AB Group-living animals must coordinate their behaviour to maintain group cohesion. Therefore, documenting when and how wild animals coordinate their behaviour in groups is important for inferring the cost of collective behaviour. However, previous field studies focused on certain species exhibiting strong social relationships, and limited information is available on species that form fluid groups, which may show different behavioural coordination. Here, using biologging, we examined the stability and mechanism of group cohesion in Adelie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, travelling on sea ice. GPS tracking showed that two or three birds in each of three groups departed the colony at the same time, travelled together for several hours and reached the ice edge simultaneously. In all groups, penguins achieved a consensus on travelling speed, maintaining group cohesion until reaching the ice edge. We collected records of three-axis acceleration for a group of three birds, which allowed us to classify their behaviours (resting, walking or tobogganing) and examine behavioural coordination among the group members in detail. Two possible mechanisms of synchronous travelling were speculated. First, the group members match their timing of resting, suggesting that the onset of resting of an individual is followed by that of the others. Second, locomotion modes (walking/tobogganing) and locomotion speed in each mode while travelling in groups differ between individuals. To maintain group cohesion, penguins may adjust either the speed in each locomotion mode or the proportional use of the locomotion mode to match the overall travelling speed. Additionally, the tracked penguins alternated their relative spatial positions and the order of synchronous resting initiation, suggesting mutual social influences. Overall, Adelie penguins actively maintain group cohesion with occasional members by mutually coordinating their behaviours while travelling in groups on sea ice. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Body movements are known to play an active role in sensing. However, it is not fully understood what information is provided by these movements. The Peter's elephantnose fish, Gnathonemus petersii, sense their environment through active electrolocation during which they use epidermal electroreceptors to perceive object-induced distortions of a self-produced electric field. The analysis of electric images projected on their skin enables them to discriminate between three-dimensional objects. While we know the electric image parameters used to encode numerous object properties, we do not understand how these images encode object shape. We hypothesized that 'movement-induced modulations' (MIMs) elicited by body movements might be involved in shape discrimination during active electrolocation. To test this, we trained fish to complete a shape discrimination task in a two-alternative forced-choice setup, and then manipulated the space available to individuals for scanning movements to see whether this led to a change in their discrimination performance. We found that if enough space was available, fish were very good at discriminating objects of different shapes. However, performance decreased when the space was reduced so that scanning movements were impaired. Our study demonstrates the importance of body movements for gaining complex environmental information such as object shape through active electrolocation. Movement can enhance perception by allowing the extraction of certain kinds of information. Similar observations have been made in other animals using different senses, suggesting that the core principles of sensory-motor integration might be valid for various sensory modalities.

AB Mammals use thermoregulatory behavioural strategies to reduce the cost of physiological thermoreg-ulation. Environmental temperatures should, therefore, impact their decisions. We investigated the effect of environmental temperature on the movement decisions of a large mammal with low capacity for physiological thermoregulation: the giant anteater, Myrmecophaga tridactyla. We GPS-tracked 14 giant anteaters in the Brazilian Pantanal wetland over 5 years. We used hidden Markov models to identify two behavioural states (encamping, as a proxy of resting, and moving, as a proxy of being active) across individuals' trajectories. Then, we estimated the effect of environmental temperature on the probability of moving across the hours of the day in open and forested habitats. We also used integrated step se-lection analysis to understand how environmental temperature drives giant anteater's habitat selection across the day. Giant anteaters showed three important behavioural thermoregulatory strategies in response to environmental temperature changes: they modulated activity duration, completely shifted activity period on a scale of days and selected forests as thermal shelters. With increasing environmental temperature, giant anteaters increased activity duration, nocturnality and diurnal selection for forests, increasing energy intake while avoiding heat gain by solar radiation. With decreasing environmental temperature, they decreased activity duration, increased diurnality and increased nocturnal selection for forests, thus gaining heat from solar radiation when active and taking shelter in milder microclimates when resting. Besides their high short-term behavioural plasticity regarding activity, giant anteaters also used forests to thermoregulate. These results provide insights into how other mammals could respond to climate change. In particular, we highlight the importance of forests as thermal shelters, offering milder temperatures than adjacent open areas during both hot and cold weather spells. Thermal shelters will become more and more indispensable to animal thermoregulation as the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events increase.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB A growing number of studies show that anthropization can alter the behaviour, survival, physiology, cognition and reproduction of many animal species. However, its impact on parental care, a common behaviour where even subtle changes can have dramatic effects on the viability of future generations and thereby jeopardize population dynamics, remains surprisingly unclear. Here, we studied the effects of exposure to cadmium, a highly toxic chemical pollutant widely distributed in the trophic chain, on egg production and maternal egg care in the European earwig, Forficula auricularia. We fed 200 females with food containing cadmium at five different concentrations for several weeks, and then quantified the number of eggs produced, the expression of six forms of egg care and three forms of noncare behaviours, as well as maternal survival and egg development. In contrast to most results reported in other animal species, we found no evidence that ingestion of even substantial doses of cadmium affects egg production or maternal egg care in the form of grooming, antennation, displacement, gathering, defence or retrieval. Moreover, it neither affected maternal exploration, inactivity or self-grooming behaviours, nor egg development time, hatching rate or juvenile weight. Overall, these results reveal that egg care is resilient to environmental cadmium pollution in earwigs and suggest that females possess efficient and fast-acting physiological processes that help them reduce their sensitivity to heavy metal contamination. More generally, our findings may suggest that selection pressures associated with the necessity to express egg care has directly or indirectly selected for higher resistance/tolerance against certain chemical pollution, and thus that species with parental care could be more resilient in the face of increasing levels of anthropogenic pollution.

AB Visually matching the background environment is an important means by which many animals avoid predation. Yet natural habitats are rarely uniform over space and time. A key question is whether prey behaviour depends on an individual's perceived vulnerability. Using the crowned stick insect, Onchestus rentzi, as a model, we asked whether individuals' willingness to take risks, and their decision to react or to remain motionless when facing a predator threat, is explained by their appearance matching the background and/or variation in their life history traits. Over 4 consecutive weeks, we assayed individuals' tendencies to take risks and exhibit defensive displays in response to predation risk. We also measured individuals' body reflectance relative to their background (i.e. contrast) and traits related to life history that might influence risk-taking behaviours, including reproductive traits in both males and females. Individuals differed consistently from each other in their behaviour over time, with risk-prone in-dividuals engaging more in defensive displays than risk-averse animals. Although we found no effects of body reflectance per se on individual variation in behaviour, we observed a strong positive correlation between defensive behaviours and reflectance relative to the background (i.e. contrast), revealing a functional link between behavioural variation and perceived vulnerability that is independent of life history traits.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Growing evidence suggests that individual variation in learning is ubiquitous, but why this is the case and what the consequences are is still a subject of much debate and research. One key set of explanations for variation in learning behaviour is that it relates to variation in animal personality traits. If personality traits affect how an individual interacts with its environment or processes information, this could directly affect performance in learning tasks. While this idea is generally well supported, there are inconsistent results on the relationships between specific personality traits and performance on different learning tasks, highlighting the need to measure multiple personality traits and to quantify different aspects of learning in the same individuals. We examined the relationship between three putative personality traits -aggression, latency to emerge from a shelter and time to contact a novel object -and learning speed in both initial and reversal olfactory learning in the house cricket, Acheta domesticus. Crickets were assayed for each personality trait, then tested for their speed to associate an odour with a water reward. Both aggression and latency to emerge were significantly repeatable, but only latency to emerge was related to learning speed, with individuals that took longer to emerge from the shelter requiring fewer trials to reach the learning criterion for both the initial and reversal learning experi-ments. We also identified sex differences in learning speed in the different experiments. Thus, our results provide some support for a relationship between personality and learning in an invertebrate.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A large body of literature demonstrates the adaptive benefits of social relationships between kin, including fitness and survival. Given that most social mammals are characterized by male-biased dispersal, the majority of research on kin selection and associated advantages focuses on social relationships between female kin. Meanwhile, research on social relationships between adult male and female kin has primarily focused on inbreeding avoidance or the benefit to adult sons, with less attention on potential advantages these social relationships may provide females. The general pattern of male dominance over females in most mammal species suggests that females may benefit from protective associations with adult male kin. Using 43 years of behavioural data on the wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, of Gombe National Park, Tanzania, we examined association patterns between females and their adult maternal male kin. We specifically focused on how these associations may represent a trade-off between inbreeding avoidance and protection for females, particularly against infanticide. In accordance with inbreeding avoidance, we predicted that females' association with adult kin would decrease when they were maximally tumescent, signalling sexual receptivity. To determine whether female-male kin associations provide protection to females, we examined female associations with adult male kin during their first year postpartum when infants are most vulnerable to infanticide. We predicted that during this first year postpartum, females would have a higher association with male kin than with unrelated males. We found that females associated more with adult sons and brothers than with unrelated males when they did not have a sexual swelling. Female association increased with all males across tumescence but females associated less with their brothers than they did with their sons and unrelated males when they were maximally tumescent, providing equivocal support for the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis. Furthermore, females associated more with both sons and brothers than with unrelated males in the first 6 months of the postpartum period. Higher association with brothers, relative to unrelated males, persisted throughout the first year postpartum. Together, these results speak to the cost-benefit trade-off in female and adult male kin associations, highlighting the potential protective advantage for females, especially during the postpartum period.

AB Audience effects are key in studies of animal social cognition and are typically investigated during directed social interactions. Male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, regularly perform aggressive displays in the presence of others, often targeting a specific group member, and combine this agonistic behaviour with acoustic signals. Here, we were interested in whether the production and structure of pant hoots, a long-distance signal, were influenced by audience composition (i.e. presence and absence of specific individuals). We investigated pant hoots produced during displays by adult and subadult males of Budongo Forest, Uganda. We found that males overall called more often when their preferred social partners and females were absent from the party, as well as when more dominant males were present. We then separately analysed the four phases of pant hoots, introduction, build-up, climax and let-down, and found that audience composition and social context could often explain the presence or absence of each phase. In addition, displays were often accompanied by drumming, especially by older males and when male audiences were small. Our study adds to the growing body of literature on audience effects and other social factors and shows their impact on the structure of a sophisticated vocal sequence, which enhances the communicative capacity in a species with limited vocal control.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB City-living animals are exposed to pervasive human-generated noise from traffic and industry. There is growing evidence that this exposure may have deleterious physiological and behavioural effects. Cognitive processes could be particularly sensitive to the disruptive effects of noise, but little is known about the potential effects of noise on cognition and cognitive development. We compared the cognitive performance of wild, urban-dwelling Australian magpies, Cracticus tibicen tyrannica, in resident groups exposed to differing levels of environmental noise. We found no evidence that cognitive performance (measured across four behavioural tests estimating different aspects of cognitive ability) covaried with the amplitude of ambient anthropogenic noise across an urban gradient of noise levels. With the exception of one task (spatial memory), the cognitive development of adolescent magpies measured at two different developmental stages (on average 160 and 290 days postfledging) was also similar, irrespective of whether they had been exposed to relatively high or low levels of anthropogenic noise. Our results suggest that levels of anthropogenic noise typical of city parklands do not appear to negatively impact general cognitive performance.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB An ongoing debate in animal behaviour research is whether food calls function to cooperatively inform others or provide the caller with competitive advantages. When feeding, chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, produce two types of call: context-specific, close-range 'rough grunts' and context-general, long-range 'pant hoots'. We investigated this dual signalling behaviour by wild male chimpanzees that were either actively joining others or passively being joined in food trees, considering the effects of the audience composition and the type of food encountered. For arriving individuals, we found that pant hoot pro-duction was best explained by the absence of socially important individuals (i.e. social bond partners and/or high-ranking males), suggesting that callers were cooperatively informing them about food availability, probably to strengthen social relationships. In contrast, rough grunts were mostly produced by low-ranking individuals, suggesting they were part of competitive interactions to avoid aggression. For individuals already in a tree, we found that both rough grunt and pant hoot production were most common in low-ranking individuals reacting to the arrival of high-ranking males and there was no significant effect of the presence, or absence, of social bond partners. We discuss these patterns and conclude that, when chimpanzees enter a food tree, their vocal behaviour functions to mediate both cooperative and competitive interactions.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Few studies have looked at variation in male mating strategies in relation to phenotypic quality perhaps because males are not traditionally thought to be choosy. Recent theoretical models, however, predict that body condition should affect mating preferences. In crayfish, chelae are important weapons and may be reliable indicators of quality in both sexes. Here, we investigated mating preference in male red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, of standardized size and different chelae condition. In the first experiment, the quality of each crayfish was classified according to whether both chelae were intact or lost. We compared the mating preferences of high-quality males (two chelae) and low-quality males (no chelae) when choosing high-and low-quality females. The second experiment explored whether males with a single chela chose females based on their single chela side (left-clawed and right-clawed). The results showed that high-quality males were not choosy, while low-quality males preferred high-quality females. Left-clawed males preferred right-clawed females, but right-clawed males did not discriminate between partners based on chela side. We consider this may be due to an adaptation in mating strategies and handedness. Our study suggests a conditional male mating strategy based on quality and symmetry which could maintain the success of copulation regardless of chelae loss.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Predation risk is a major driver of the distribution of prey animals, which typically show strong responses to cues for predator presence. An unresolved question is whether na??ve individuals respond to mimicked cues, and whether such cues can be used to deter prey. We investigated whether playback of wolf sounds induces fear responses in na??ve ungulates in a human-dominated landscape from which wolves have been eradicated since 1879. We conducted a playback experiment in mixed-coniferous and broadleaved forest that harboured three cervid and one suid species. At 36 locations, we played wolf sounds, sounds of local sheep or no sounds, consecutively, in random order, and recorded visit rate and group size, using camera traps. Visit rates of cervids and wild boar showed a clear initial reduction to playback of both wolf and sheep sounds, but the type of response differed between sound, forest type and species. For na??ve wild boar in particular, responses to predator cues depended on forest type. Effects on visit rate disappeared within 21 days. Group sizes in all the species were not affected by the sound treatment. Our findings suggest that the responses of na??ve ungulates to wolf sound seem to be species specific, depend on forest type and wear off in time, indicating habituation. Before we can successfully deter ungulates using predator sound, we should further investigate how different forest types affect the perception of na??ve ungulates to these sounds, as responses to predator sound may depend on habitat characteristics. ?? 2022 The Authors.

AB Many animals have the ability to learn, and some taxa have shown learned mate preference, which may be important for speciation. The butterfly Heliconius melpomene is a model system for several areas of research, including hybridization, mate selection and speciation, partially due to its widespread diversity of wing patterns. It remains unclear whether social experience shapes realized mating preferences in this species. Here we test whether previous experience with a female influences male mate preference for two H. melpomene subspecies, H. m. malleti and H. m. rosina. We conducted no-choice assays to determine whether male courtship (versus no courtship) and latency to court differed between naive males and males with previous exposure to a sexually mature, virgin female. To test whether assortative courtship preference is learned in H. melpomene, males were either paired with a female who shared their phenotype or one who did not. Naive H. m. malleti males courted assortatively, while naive H. m. rosina males did not. When data were pooled across subspecies, experienced males reduced their courting relative to naive males, suggesting that social experience with a female sans copulation may be perceived as a negative experience. This effect was likely driven by experienced H. m. malleti males, who reduced their courting relative to naive males when analysed independently, while experienced H. m. rosina males did not. Our results suggest that social experience can influence male mating behaviour in H. melpomene and has the potential to contribute to the high rate of diversification observed in Heliconius butterflies.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Discrimination between friends and foes is crucial for many superorganismal insects to ensure altruistic acts are only directed towards kin. However, whether or not an extremely sensitive recognition system is needed, could depend on the type of invaders that generally present a threat to the species in question. Ants are known to engage in intraspecific conflicts, and readily discriminate between nestmate and nonnestmate conspecifics. In contrast, fungus-growing termites do not invade or aggressively compete with neighbouring nests, but are instead often threatened by phylogenetically distant invaders, such as ants. Therefore, we hypothesized that termites have less need for a recognition system efficient in distinguishing small chemical differences. We studied intra-and interspecific recognition of the worker and soldier castes of the fungus-growing termite Macrotermes natalensis and investigated both recognition of and behaviour towards different stimuli of varying ecological importance. Both workers and soldiers were unable to efficiently discriminate against conspecific non-nestmates. Furthermore, we found that not only were soldiers more sensitive to small differences in chemical profiles than workers, but they also showed different behaviour than workers when a stimulus was recognized as foreign. Our results also raise the question whether termites have specifically evolved to recognize and react to the smell of ants. Our results reinforce the notion that nestmate recognition is a trait under stringent selection, where efficient recognition is only selected for when needed, probably because of the energetic costs of maintaining the neural tissue required.

AB In a society, several individuals can help to execute a task otherwise impossible to achieve individually. However, the unnecessary interference of another individual in a solitary task could delay task execution. We studied task interference in acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex spinicola) performing a foraging task. Foraging is solitary: a single worker carries a plant-produced food body and typically stores it inside the plant domatia, but sometimes workers discard them off the tree. Acacia ants have behavioural subcastes among workers with pronounced differences in task execution. Also, task specialization increases with colony size, hence smaller colonies have less specialized individuals. Here, we first assessed whether interferences on a solitary task provided any benefit to the colony, to counteract the delay in performing the task. We found that when nestmates interfered, food items were more likely to be stored rather than discarded. Second, we tested the role of the worker's task specialization on the occurrence of interferences. Specifically, we tested whether interferences (1) are a by-product of lacking workers specialized in foraging ('Jack-of-all-trades' effect), or (2) depend on having experts trying to take over the task ('expert effect'). We found partial support for the Jack-of-all-trades effect, because workers in smaller colonies were more often interfered with, but interferences lasted longer in medium-sized colonies; in larger colonies, workers had fewer interferences that resolved faster. Our evidence supports the 'expert effect', as experienced foragers had fewer and shorter interferences than workers not regularly foraging. Interfering in a solitary task in social insects parallels task conflicts and managerial issues in human organizations and may function as a quality control mechanism in a leaderless organization.

AB The degree to which miniature-brained insects make individual adjustments in response to changing conditions remains unclear. Honey bees, Apis mellifera, are an important insect model and have been shown to make individual speed-accuracy trade-offs, but it is currently not known whether they can adjust speed-accuracy strategies to solve tasks in dynamic ecological contexts. Further, it is unclear how they may behave when facing unsolvable or impossible tasks. We therefore tested whether honey bees flexibly allocate time in a colour discrimination task with four levels of task difficulty, and how such differences in time allocation affect accuracy. We found that response time differed between task difficulties, although accuracy did not appear to be influenced by response time. Specifically, bees allocated less time when facing an impossible task than when addressing easier tasks. Our findings suggest that honey bees demonstrate a time allocation strategy depending on context, and that there was little effect of speed on accuracy in both the easy and impossible tasks.

AB Ringing is one of the most commonly used techniques to monitor bird individuals and collect data on various aspects of their life history. However, this method involves practices (capturing and handling) that might affect individuals' behaviour. Wild animals can remember and learn from previous experiences, and, thus, they anticipate risks and modify their response in subsequent similar situations. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of playback-associated mist netting on the behaviour of the tawny pipit, Anthus campestris, a medium-sized migratory passerine bird. In playback experiments simulating territorial intrusion of a conspecific male, we examined aggressive responses of individuals attracted in the past by conspecific song playback to a mist net ('experienced' males) and compared them to the responses of individuals without such an experience ('naive' males). The interval between the capture of experienced males and the playback experiments ranged from several weeks to more than 5 years. Our results revealed prominent differences between the behaviour of naive tawny pipit males and those experienced with a capturing event. Although all tested males responded to the stimulus, experienced males tended to be substantially less aggressive and more cautious in comparison to naive individuals; prominent differences were observed, in particular, in the avoidance of close proximity to the loudspeaker by the majority of experienced males. There were no significant differences in responses to playbacks between the experienced males captured and exposed to subsequent experiments within the same or next season and those that underwent playback experiments later, up to 5 years after having been previously trapped. These findings suggest that male tawny pipits may negatively associate playback stimulation with capturing events and remember such experiences over a time period comparable to the expected life span of this species in the wild.

AB Despite reported findings, explanations for within-species variation in behavioural performance on cognitive tests are still understudied. Cognitive processes are influenced by environmental and genetic differences, where cognitive stimulation and monoaminergic systems are predicted to be important. To explore explanations for individual variation in impulsivity (a behaviour that is negatively correlated with inhibitory control), we experimentally altered the environment of red junglefowl, Gallus gallus, by exposing chicks from newly hatched to 9 weeks old to either (1) both environmental and cognitive enrichment, (2) environmental enrichment without additional cognitive enrichment or (3) neither environmental nor cognitive enrichment. Subsequently, we measured variation in impulsivity and brain gene expression of genes from the dopaminergic system (DRD1 and DRD2) and serotonergic system (5HT2A, 5HT1B, 5HT2B, 5HT2C and TPH). We focused on two aspects of impulsivity, impulsive action and persistence, and their reduction over time. Cognitively enriched chicks tended to have higher initial impulsive action and had higher initial persistence, and our environmentally enriched chicks had slower reduction of impulsive action over time. DRD2 (a dopamine receptor gene) had lower expression in environmentally enriched chicks. Variation in impulsive action tended to correlate with expression of TPH (a gene involved in serotonin synthesis), whereas persistence correlated with both TPH and the dopamine receptor gene DRD1, and tended to correlate with the dopaminergic gene DRD2, regardless of rearing treatment. These results indicate that both environment and links to neurobiology could explain initial individual variation in, and reduction of, impulsivity.

TI Prey colour biases of araneophagic mud-daubing wasps
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
DE conspicuousness; foraging behaviour; prey selection; spider; visual
   ecology
AB While foraging, it is critical for a predator to detect and recognize its prey quickly in order to optimize its energy investment. In response, prey can use low-cost energy strategies such as crypsis and immobility that operate early in the detection-attack sequence. Mesopredators, such as spiders, are themselves attacked by visually oriented predators such as mud-dauber wasps. However, it is not known which colour cues are used by wasps to detect and capture their spider prey or whether there are biases towards such cues. In this study, we evaluated the prey colour biases of two mud-dauber wasps (Trypoxylon tridentatum and Trypoxylon bridwelli) using full-spectrum digital photography and visual modelling. We compared the colour contrast of spiders that were preyed upon with that of the spiders in the surrounding habitat. We show that the spiders captured by the wasps had higher chromatic contrast with their typical backgrounds compared with other co-occurring spider species not found in Trypoxylon nests. Our results suggest that Trypoxylon wasps may exhibit colour biases and/or preferences when hunting their spider prey. Our study highlights the importance of considering the perceptual abilities and biases of predators when studying predator-prey interactions.

AB Behaviour is often both repeatable among individuals (i.e. personality) and plastically adjusted within individuals according to environmental conditions or age. Yet, little is known about the repeatability and age-related plasticity in behavioural traits across the lifetime of free-living animals, which is, however, crucial for understanding the development and evolutionary consequences of personality in the wild. Here, we explored long-term (co)variation and age-dependent expression of two female behaviours, female-female aggression and hissing behaviour, using longitudinal data of free-living great tits, Parus major. Both behaviours were repeatable across years but did not covary among females into a behavioural syndrome. In contrast to hissing behaviour, female aggression declined with age on the population level, which was due to within-individual plasticity in aggression and not selective disappearance. Moreover, individual females differed in their level of plasticity, with more aggressive females showing a steeper decline in aggression than less aggressive females, resulting in a pattern where females became more similar in aggression with age. At the same time, the repeatability of aggression increased with age, mostly driven by a decrease in within-individual variance across age. Large betweenand within individual differences in same-sex aggression in early life and a higher repeatability in later life may be functionally linked to age-dependent requirements and constraints. Overall, our findings suggest that how female aggression will respond to selection might depend on when during the life cycle selection is operating, which has important consequences for the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of animal personality in the wild.

AB Individuals and social groups balance foraging activities with other energetically demanding behaviours. In honey bee colonies, foraging and nest defence behaviours are performed by similar-aged bees, and so hives must adjust their workforce investment to fulfil both tasks. We investigate this balance in the context of honey robbing, a tactic in which foragers invade a victim hive, kill worker bees and steal honey stores. Robbing is highly beneficial because stored honey is a plentiful, concentrated food resource. However, robbing requires a large workforce to overwhelm the defences of the victim hive; it is unknown how robbing hives adjust other behaviours to accommodate this demand. We developed a method to provoke a hive to engage in simulated robbing and measured rapid changes in foraging activity and nest defence. Surprisingly, robbing hives increased both behaviours. Guards, the individuals responsible for nest defence, specifically increased defensiveness towards their own nestmates as they returned from a robbing trip. We found that increased foraging activity and changes in forager odour profiles from prolonged exposure to victim hive honeycomb were insufficient to explain robbing-induced changes in guard defensiveness. However, brain gene expression profiles of robbing foragers suggest these bees are unusually aggressive, and thus more likely to provoke aggression from nestmate guards. Increased forager aggression occurred even in the absence of direct competition with victim bees. Thus, although increased guard defensiveness may be costly in terms of increased nestmate mortality, because the ecological conditions that promote robbing simultaneously increase the likelihood a hive will become a robbing target, guards may use cues from returning nestmates to determine invasion risk and adjust their defensiveness accordingly. These results suggest that colonies use social information to dynamically optimize both foraging and defensiveness in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of this high-risk tactic.

AB Complex systems (e.g. eusocial insect colonies) exhibit emergent behaviours as a result of the interactions of their components. These components often vary in several traits. Such variation may improve system performance by increasing its efficiency or its robustness to environmental change. These two outcomes, efficiency and robustness, are often thought to be in opposition. Therefore, variation may be beneficial only under certain environmental conditions. Here we aim to understand why variation evolved in a particular system, bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies. Workers in these colonies vary in body size, which affects the tasks they perform as well as their starvation resistance, suggesting potential impacts on efficiency and robustness, respectively. We examine how this variation affects colony performance under different environmental conditions and how colonies respond physiologically to these conditions. We maintained colonies of equal biomass but with either variable or less variable worker body sizes using targeted worker removal. We found that colonies with variable body sizes did not produce more brood (i.e. did not show evidence of increased performance) under predictable or unpredictable food environments. However, workers that developed under the unpredictable environment were smaller relative to their weight at eclosion. This effect was due in part to an increase in stored lipids, particularly in smaller workers. These physiological changes may explain why mortality rates did not differ between the predictable and unpredictable environment. Therefore, our finding that size variation did not affect colony performance suggests that size variation may be a neutral trait, present because selection is not acting against it. Our results also suggest that workers respond physiologically to differences in environmental conditions, which is important to consider when testing system robustness.

AB Communication plays an integral role in facilitating intra- and interspecific interactions. The study of signal function and content reveals the rules that govern such interactions, informing hypotheses in behavioural ecology and evolution. The ubiquitous nature of antipredator vocalizations in ground squirrels provides a useful model for studying the evolution of communication. Conspecifics in many ground squirrel species respond to anti-predator vocalizations, and sociality functions as a strong selective force favouring more informative antipredator vocalizations. However, studies of a single antipredator vocalization system in both social and nonsocial contexts are relatively scarce, preventing diagnosis of selective forces other than sociality. We conducted a 2-year study to test two alternative hypotheses relating to the function of antipredator vocalizations in a nonhibernating squirrel, the Harris' antelope squirrel, Ammospermophilus harristi. We hypothesized that if vocalizations function as a predator deterrent, callers should be of equal sex ratio and vocalize year-round. If vocalizations function primarily as a warning to offspring, callers should be predominantly female and vocalize only when juveniles are above ground. We found that spontaneous callers were predominantly female but vocalized throughout the year. We also found that call bouts varied in trill number, which could hold additional layers of information. Our results suggest that antipredator vocalizations function as both a predator deterrent and a warning to offspring. Antipredator vocalizations with multiple functions or receivers are subject to a greater compilation of selective forces that may induce communicative complexity to arise.

AB Animals living in heterogeneous landscapes are often faced with making a trade-off between maximizing foraging success and avoiding risk. Using high-resolution GPS-tracking data, this study explored the fine-scale movement patterns and risk sensitivity of crop-raiding African elephants, Loxodonta africana, in the anthropogenic landscape of Tsavo, Kenya. We analysed patterns in the speed and tortuosity of elephant movements over the 24 h surrounding crop-raiding events and compared them with those of nonraiding elephants during corresponding periods. Crop-raiding elephants moved faster and straighter (less tortuously) with closer temporal proximity to farmland, which we argue reflects their increased intensity of risk avoidance behaviours in response to approaching humans. Once inside farmland, elephants appeared to reduce movements associated with risk avoidance to forage intensively on crops, decreasing their speed and reducing the likelihood of moving in straight lines while crop raiding. These results highlight trade-offs in the fine-scale movement patterns of elephants living in anthropogenic landscapes with differing levels of habitat quality and exposure to humans, providing new insight into how they perceive the risks associated with crop raiding.

AB Constructing a nest within a mating territory provides a clear benefit to the resident, particularly by improving the opportunity to mate. It is unclear whether animals who use nests exclusively for reproductive purposes account for either the effort invested or the resulting increase in mating potential when valuing their territories. We sought to explicitly reveal a nest's added subjective resource value through within-group comparison of aggressive behaviour before and after nest construction. An increase in aggression following construction would indicate that the resident perceives greater subjective value in his territory, and thus values the nest. Threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, fish demonstrate stereotypical aggressive behaviours during an easily induced territorial defence. The male's nest is used exclusively for reproductive purposes, avoiding any confound of shelter. Contrary to our hypothesis, neither nest presence, timing of construction, nor nesting outcome was associated with differences in behavioural measures of territorial aggression. Assessed behaviours were robust, repeatable and intercorrelated. We conclude that territorial aggression is neither predictive of nor altered by nesting in threespine stickleback fish. Our results suggest that nests used transiently for a portion of the mating season add negligible subjective resource value to a territory. We additionally demonstrate that examinations of territorial aggression in sticklebacks do not need to control for nest building, improving statistical power by decreasing dropout rates. These results dovetail with recent work in other fish species to suggest that assessment of territorial aggression absent a nest may be practicable for fish in general. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB In an earlier study (Chen et al., 2019, Science, 363(6423), 166-167), we showed that budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus, females increase their preference for males that were observed solving two extractive foraging problems. Camacho-Alpizar et al. (2020, Animal Behaviour, 165, e1-e3) question whether this outcome shows that females evaluate the cognitive skills of males. Their main argument is that individual differences in problem solving are often due to differences in noncognitive abilities. Here we outline the differences between the use of problem-solving tasks as it is mostly done and how we used it in our study. We argue that our design maximizes the chance that observed differences in male problem solving indicate differences in learning abilities to an observing female. We agree with Camacho-Alpizar et al. that the topic of the evolution of cognitive abilities through sexual selection deserves further study and hope our study (Chen et al., 2019), Camacho-Alpizar et al.'s comment and this reply will stimulate further research.

AB All songbirds have their own species-specific song, and vocal variety among individuals of the same species is used for communication. Some aspects of vocal variety have been shown to relate to sender characteristics and thus to convey a potential message to receivers. During playback experiments, individuals show different response patterns, which provide evidence for perception, and thus meaning, of the vocal variety. Here, we tested the impact of two types of vocal variety: syllable diversity and syllable switching in the common chiffchaff, Phylloscopus collybita, in two separate playback experiments. We found that syllable diversity was a relatively fixed trait and that variation among individuals was likely to reflect some male quality triggering responses of different intensity. Higher rates of syllable switching did not elicit different responses but songs after playback showed that it is a dynamic trait, potentially contributing to motivational signalling together with other song parameters. The resolution of analyses in our experiments revealed subtle changes in vocal features over time in unprecedented detail. This approach unveiled an intricate combination of various vocal features during the response that may complement each other during vocal interactions. We believe future studies would benefit from the same resolution, through which one can explore advanced levels in animal communication. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Risk-taking behaviours that are optimal in one context (predators absent) may be suboptimal in a different context (predators present), suggesting that individuals with 'bold' behaviours will experience increased predation risk. Yet, in some instances, bold individuals experience lower predation. Thus, there is not always a direct trade-off between boldness and predation risk. To better understand the relationship between boldness and predation risk, suboptimal behaviours must be viewed within the context of an organism's entire integrated antipredator strategy. Using freshwater snails exposed to a predator cue, we examined whether quickly re-emerging from the shell was a repeatable, carryover behaviour that was tied to behavioural and morphological antipredator traits. Slow-emerging snails invested in morphological shell defence and remained in the predator environment, whereas quick-emerging snails consistently avoided the predator environment and did not invest in shell defences. Therefore, slow-emerging snails used a sit-and-wait antipredator strategy by relying on their shells for protection and were less likely to avoid the predator environment; conversely, quick-emerging snails used an avoidance (or dispersal) strategy by consistently associating with the water's surface and investing less in shell defences. A path analysis of these antipredator traits indicates that the carryover effect of bold behaviour may be an important factor that mediates complementary behavioural and morphological traits that reduce predation risks. This study supports the 'behavioural character' hypothesis, which suggests that boldness is a latent variable upon which selection can act and thereby shape a variety of quasi-independent traits (e.g. antipredator traits). According to this perspective, selection is not acting on a single antipredator behavioural trait in isolation, but rather on an integrated antipredator strategy that is facilitated by individual differences in carryover risk-taking behaviour.

AB Individuals and groups within the same population may differ in their use of resources. Also referred to as niche specialization, such differences can be documented through direct or indirect observation of resource or habitat use. Here, we examined selective habitat use in alliance-forming male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Using 6 years of sighting data (2001-2006), we calculated the home ranges of 17 male alliances (comprising 3-14 individuals each). We defined five habitat types in the study area and measured the proportion of each habitat type in the home range of each alliance. Habitat selectivity was examined using selection ratios of used and available habitat within alliance home ranges. Since home range is also a form of habitat selection, we also examined selection ratios of alliances within defined subareas within the study area. Subareas were the combined home ranges of subsets of alliances that were linked by general location, distinctive habitat features and seasonal movement patterns. During each sighting, the predominant group behaviour was recorded. We analysed data from all sightings (which included all behavioural types: resting, travelling, socializing and foraging), as well as a restricted set of foraging groups only. For all sightings, alliances were selective of habitat within each of three subareas (northern, central, southern), and 14 alliances were selective of habitat within their home range. For foraging sightings, alliances within all three subareas were selective with respect to foraging habitat, and seven alliances showed significant selection of foraging habitat within their respective home ranges. Some alliances with broadly overlapping ranges foraged in different habitats. Alliance-specific habitat use may be influenced by ecological and social factors. Our results raise the possibility that the considerable variation in alliance size within this population may be influenced by the distribution of food as well as the distribution of females.

AB Caudal autotomy, the voluntary shedding of a tail, is a last-ditch strategy used by many lizard species to escape from predators. There are several costs associated with caudal autotomy that may cause lizards to change their behaviour during tail regeneration. These behavioural changes may be dependent upon individual differences in response to autotomy (e.g. trait or state-dependent differences) and/or the degree of tail loss, as many lizards have the capacity to only partially shed their tail which probably entails fewer costs relative to complete autotomy. However, no study, to our knowledge, has considered how caudal autotomy, or the extent of autotomy, affects individual behavioural variation. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of both partial and complete tail loss on individual behavioural variation in delicate skinks, Lampropholis delicata. We found that lizards that experienced complete tail loss, on average, became less active and explorative and had much slower sprint speeds following autotomy. These lizards also became more predictable and consistent in their behaviour, exhibiting a notable decrease in their within-individual behavioural variance. In contrast, we did not see any significant behavioural effects in lizards that experienced partial tail loss. We also found a positive among-individual correlation between activity/exploration and neophilia, but tail loss had no effect on the structure of this syndrome. Our results suggest that complete tail loss may impose effects on traits more closely associated with locomotion and predator escape ability, while also constraining an individual's capacity for differential behavioural expression.

AB Individuals often vary in their problem-solving performance, and animal personality may help explain such interindividual variation because it affects how individuals perceive and interact with their environment. Proximate factors (behavioural variety, persistence, selectivity and experience) provide behavioural mechanisms that also affect problem-solving performance. Our aim was to assess the link between personality and problem-solving performance in wild-caught, common brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula, and to assess their learning capability. We tested how possums, a native marsupial inhabiting the inner urban environment of Sydney, Australia, solved an escape box problem in the field. Possums could solve this problem by either pushing (easy) or pulling (difficult) a door. We quantified personality traits, including exploration, activity and vigilance, in a separate arena test. We found that personality traits affected problem solving. Exploratory animals were more likely to succeed in their first trial irrespective of task type, but only highly exploratory individuals were likely to solve the difficult task. More active and more vigilant individuals were also more likely to succeed, regardless of task type. For mechanistic behaviours employed during the problem-solving test, individuals spending more time engaged (persistent) were less likely to succeed in the easy task, because they focused more on nonfunctional parts of the box. In contrast, persistent individuals were more likely to succeed in the difficult task. Possums learnt effectively, solving tasks substantially faster on their second attempt. Our study provides the first demonstration of problem solving in free-ranging marsupials using an ecologically relevant test. This allows future comparison of behavioural commonalities and tests of convergent evolution in problem solving among taxa. Furthermore, while personality traits influenced problem-solving capability, we suggest that the rapid improvement in problem solving by all possums through experience and learning helps explain their success in dealing with artificial or novel problems associated with the urban environment.

AB When animal mating signals diverge between populations, reproductive isolation and speciation may occur. Variation in animals' responses to these signals may reveal whether differences in perception contribute to behavioural differences between populations. We tested whether signal divergence influences receiver responses to playback in the rufous-capped warbler, Basileuterus rufifrons, a Neotropical resident songbird with a contact zone between two divergent subspecies, B. r. delattrii and B. r. rufifrons, in southern Mexico. Studying nearby populations of birds living in allopatry and sympatry, we presented warblers with playback-simulated territorial male rivals of each subspecies. In sympatry, both delattrii and rufifrons responded more strongly to songs of their own subspecies than to songs of the other subspecies, whereas in allopatry, delattrii responded strongly to songs of both subspecies, suggesting possible reproductive character displacement. Our research demonstrates that sympatric delattrii and rufifrons discriminate between each other's songs, suggesting that song is a premating isolating barrier between these divergent subspecies. This study adds to the growing literature on receiver response to vocal signal divergence in closely related sympatric and allopatric animal populations.

AB Climate change predictions include increased mean temperatures and increased frequency of heatwaves. Short-term responses to high air temperatures can allow animals to conserve water while maintaining a safe body temperature. For birds, cooling is often through evaporative water loss, which can be physiologically costly. Microsite use is an effective means of conserving water via reducing environmental heat load, so long as there are no negative trade-offs with other necessary functions, such as foraging. We examined behavioural responses to temperature in Cape rockjumpers, Chaetops frenatus (hereafter: 'rockjumper'), an alpine specialist bird. We hypothesized that rockjumper behaviours would be temperature and microsite dependent. We collected data on rockjumper microsite use (sun, rock shade), behaviour (activity, foraging, preening, panting) and temperature (air, environmental). Rockjumpers made increased use of rock shade as air temperature increased. However, birds in rock shade foraged less. Depending on where their main food source is located, this suggests that when foraging demands are high, birds may need to remain in the sun despite risks of high thermal load, or else may suffer costs of lost foraging opportunities when using shade. The relationship between air temperature and heat dissipation behaviour (panting) was also mediated by microsite: birds showed significant increases in panting with increasing air temperature only when in the sun. The lack of increase in panting for birds in rock shade suggests that shade seeking may buffer physiological thermoregulatory costs (i.e. water expenditure). Individuals may therefore be able to mitigate some potential negative effects of high temperatures by making use of cooler microsites, although this could come at a cost to foraging.

AB Sexually dimorphic traits in males are thought to evolve via female preference or male-male competition. Alternatively, in species without overt male displays or female mate choice, dimorphic coloration may function as a warning signal to conspecific males thereby avoiding costly harassment. We aimed to determine the function of sexual dimorphic coloration in the damselfly Xanthagrion erythroneurum in which males, but not females, have conspicuous blue bands on the tip of the abdomen. We show that the male blue bands and female black abdomen are chromatically and achromatically discriminable against their natural background. Moreover, the male blue bands and their adjacent abdominal segments generate higher internal contrast than female abdominal segments. We conducted two sets of experiments to test alternative hypotheses that the male blue bands are (1) the target of female mate choice, or (2) an intrasexual aposematic signal to avoid male mating harassment. We hid male blue bands by painting them black and measured female preference between the manipulated and the nonmanipulated (control) males. We found no difference in mating success between the control and manipulated males, thereby rejecting the female preference hypothesis. To test whether the blue bands function as a warning signal, we manipulated the females by painting male-like blue bands on their abdomen and measured the male response to those females relative to control females. Females with artificial blue bands on the terminal abdomen were mated less frequently than control females. However, when we painted blue bands on the anterior abdominal segments, the males did not discriminate between control and painted females. Our study demonstrates that dimorphic coloration advertises the males' unprofitability as mates to conspecifics thereby reducing intrasexual harassment.

AB Parental care can lead to a conflict of interest between parents and offspring. For central place foragers, conflict is expected to be particularly intensive in species that feed on relatively inaccessible, distant food resources. Some pelagic seabirds use distinct foraging strategies when provisioning young versus self-feeding: short trips near the colony versus long trips far away. Limited empirical evidence shows that the strategy used by parents depends on their own state and that of their young, suggesting that dynamic optimization may help reduce conflict. Tests of this hypothesis, however, are scarce. Using a combination of GPS tracking and nest monitoring, we examined whether foraging strategy choice by Manx shear-waters, Puffinus puffinus, is explained by the body condition of parents and offspring before trip departure, and whether choice affects condition upon return. When chick body condition was poor prior to departure, subsequent foraging trips by adults were significantly shorter and chick condition upon return improved. When chick condition was good prior to departure, the reverse happened. There was no evidence that adult condition affected subsequent trip choice, but adults returning from slow, long-duration trips were in comparatively better condition. Thus, although the trips that were good for offspring were different to those that were favourable for adults, trip choice was only dependent on chick condition, which may explain why there was no evidence for a trade-off between adult and chick condition during individual trips. Our results suggest that spatiotemporal variation in foraging strategies is driven by the conflicting needs of parents and offspring, but that the parents can reduce the conflict, resulting in no detectable trade-off under these conditions. This link between parental care and space use is likely to be widespread in central place foragers but remains largely unexplored in most systems.

AB Four groups of toothed whales have independently evolved to produce narrowband high-frequency (NBHF) echolocation signals (i.e. clicks) with a strikingly similar waveform and centroid frequency around 125 kHz. These signals are thought to help NBHF species avoid predation by echolocating and communicating at frequencies inaudible to predators, a form of acoustic crypsis. Heaviside's dolphins produce NBHF echolocation clicks in trains and often in rapid succession in the form of buzzes. In addition, a second click type with a lower frequency and broader bandwidth was recently described, typically emitted in rapid succession in the form of burst-pulses. We investigated the relationship between buzz and burst-pulse signals and both surface behaviour (foraging, 'interacting with the kayak' and socializing) and group size, using a multivariable regression on the signal occurrence and signal count data. Signal occurrence and counts were not related to group size in the regression analysis. Burstpulses were strongly linked to socializing behaviour, occurring more often and more frequently during socializing and much less during foraging. Buzz vocalizations were not strongly linked to a specific behaviour although there was some evidence of an increase in production during foraging and socializing. In addition, individual level production rates of buzzes during foraging and socializing, and burstpulses during socializing decreased with increasing group size. Temporally patterned burst-pulse signals were also identified, often occurring within a series of burst-pulses and were directly linked to specific events such as aerial leaping, backflipping, tail slapping and potential mating. Our findings suggest Heaviside's dolphins have a more complex communication system based on pulsed vocalizations than previously understood, perhaps driven by the need to facilitate the social interactions of this species.

AB Positive differential allocation predicts that females will increase their parental investment when mated to high-quality males due to the benefits that these males provide to offspring. Differential allocation predicts trade-offs between current and future reproduction, but investment trade-offs can also occur within a breeding event for species that provide parental care. However, differential allocation studies that have examined investment in both gametic effort and parental care remain rare and have only been conducted in birds. Fish may have more conservative investment strategies due to the large effect that current reproductive investment has on future reproductive potential. We examined gametic effort and parental care in the convict cichlid, Amatitlania siquia, a biparental fish, in response to male size, a proxy for quality. We randomly mated females to either large or small males and measured fecundity and parental behaviour of both parents. Females mated to large males did not increase their fecundity, but did provide more parental care to offspring during the larval stage, which is when male desertion in natural populations is most likely. Male size did not predict the amount of paternal care provided to offspring during the larval stage. Female condition at the end of the breeding event was negatively associated with higher fecundity and level of maternal care provided. The observed pattern of maternal investment suggests that females limit costs to future reproduction by limiting their increased investment to only one component of their reproductive effort. The increase in maternal investment during the larval stage may also serve to stabilize the pair bond and ensure continued male care, which ultimately increases the reproductive success of both parents. These results highlight important taxonomic and parental care pattern differences and broaden our understanding of the factors that influence differential allocation in diverse taxa.

AB Cognitive flexibility allows animals to readily acquire new information even when learning contingencies may rapidly change, as is the case in highly variable, but predictable, environments. While cognitive flexibility is broadly thought to be beneficial, animals exhibit inter- and intraspecific variation, with higher levels of flexibility associated with reduced memory retention and vice versa. In this review, we discuss when and why such variation may exist and focus specifically on memory and memory flexibility. We argue that retained memories may negatively affect the acquisition of new information, most likely via proactive interference, and available data suggest that there may be a trade-off between memory retention and acquiring new memories. We discuss neurogenesis-mediated forgetting as the mechanism reducing memory interference, as new neurons enhance learning new information but also cause forgetting of older memories. Selection may be expected to favour either end of the continuum between memory retention and memory flexibility depending on life history and environment. More stable environments may favour memory retention over flexibility whereas rapidly changing environments may favour flexibility over retention. Higher memory capacity also seems to be associated with higher memory interference, so higher neurogenesis rates associated with forgetting of unnecessary information may be favoured when higher capacity is beneficial such as in food-caching species. More research is necessary to understand whether inter- and intraspecific differences in the association between memory retention and flexibility are related to some general ecological patterns, whether this association is heritable, and whether developmental conditions and experience have different effects on this association in different species.

AB How do flying insects correctly respond to visual stimuli in complex natural environments? The spectacular coloration of some orders suggests that colour cues are important. Size may contain useful information as well, but insects are limited in resolving fine spatial detail due to the structure of their compound eyes. Although there have been many studies of experimentally altered body colour and pattern, we know surprisingly little about simple, isolated cues that insects use to take off after objects. Specifically, whether it is colour, size or some combination that triggers pursuit. We presented artificial bead stimuli of varying colours and sizes to perching males of the Hawaiian orangeblack damselfly Megalagrion xanthomelas in their natural forested stream habitat. Damselflies were most vigorously responsive to conspecific colours - attacking red (males) and tracking brown (females). Other colours with lesser biological relevance inspired lower response rates. Interestingly, size strongly modulated responses, whereby attack responses towards the smallest bead sizes transitioned to tracking or avoidance at the larger bead sizes. Although small beads are inherently more difficult to see, they triggered responses from greatest distances, even beyond the calculated stereopsis range of 17.5 cm. Damselflies had an object detection threshold of 0.34 degrees within a high-resolution frontally directed acute zone with an interommatidial angle of 0.82 degrees. We found evidence that size and colour serve as discrimination filters to efficiently identify objects of interest while ignoring visual noise. Simple schemes for object discrimination may help to explain how insects can differentiate among prey and conspecifics, and why multiple species can exist in the same community despite being similar in colour. We discuss implications for visual capabilities, and how visual systems that can readily discriminate size and colour can contribute to extraordinary phenotypic diversity.

AB The ability to distinguish between different quantities of items is fundamental in many ecological contexts, and it has been shown in different animal species. This ability may also be context specific. Quantity estimation in fish has mainly been analysed in the context of social behaviour, whereas a majority of studies conducted with species other than fish tested it in the context of foraging. Surprisingly, little is known about the capacity of fish to discriminate between food quantities, possibly because of difficulties in testing individual fish in a novel, and thus aversive, test environment. Here, we present a novel approach that allowed us to test single angelfish, Pterophyllum scalare, while minimizing isolation-related stress. In binary choice tests, sets composed of similarly sized discrete food items differing in numerical size were presented and the spontaneous (untrained) choice of angelfish was investigated. In all contrasts tested in three experiments, angelfish preferred the numerically larger to the smaller food set. The performance of the fish was ratio dependent in the small but not in the large number range (more than four food items, contrasts that were investigated for the first time in fishes), and there was no significant difference in the magnitude of preference for the small versus the large values. However, overall results indicated that the response was ratio dependent, with an increase in accuracy as the numerical ratio between the contrasts increased. Furthermore, the same numerical ratios that were successfully discriminated with small quantities were also similarly discriminated with large quantities. Altogether, our results thus imply that angelfish utilize the approximate number system of quantity representation for the entire numerical range tested, and that their response is an attempt to maximize foraging success.

AB Division of labour within and between the worker and queen castes is thought to underlie the tremendous success of social insects. Colonies might benefit if subsets of nurse workers specialize further in caring for larvae of a certain stage or caste, given that larval nutritional requirements depend on stage and caste. We used short-term (<1 h) and long-term (10 days) behavioural observations to determine whether nurses of the pharaoh ant, Monomorium pharaonis, exhibit such specialization. We found evidence for behavioural specialization among nurses based on larval instar but not larval caste. This specialization was widespread, with 56% of nurses in the short-term and 22-27% in the long-term showing significant specialization. Additionally, we identified -200 genes that were differentially expressed in nurse head and abdominal tissues between nurses feeding young versus old larvae. These included 18 genes predicted to code for secreted proteins, which may be passed from nurses to larvae via trophallaxis, as well as vitellogenin and major royal jelly protein-1, which have previously been implicated in the transfer of nutrition from nurse to larvae and the regulation of larval development and caste in social insects. Altogether, our results provide the first evidence in any social insect for a division of labour among nurse workers based on larval stage, and our study begins to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this specialization.

AB Coastal resident and pelagic nonresident bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, have been described in north-central Chile. Using long-term residence data (over 13 years of photo-identification) and genetic mtDNA information, we analysed the social dynamics through time and the genetic variation of this long-term resident population, and evaluated its sociogenetic interaction with nonresidents. Pelagic nonresident dolphins exhibited a higher level of genetic diversity than coastal residents and a significant difference in genetic structure was detected between them. Based on the difference in haplotype numbers and frequencies between resident and nonresident populations and between resident males and females, we propose a population dynamic model in which the resident population is composed of (1) resident females (founder lineages) and some of their female descendants that were born in and remained in the group, without effective female immigration from the nonresident population, (2) resident male descendants of the founder lineage that were born in and remained in the group and (3) resident males that were incorporated from the pelagic groups. Male-biased migration from nonresident pelagic groups into the resident population likely contributes to genetic variation and therefore may help limit inbreeding in the resident population. Finally, we propose that the peripatric model of population differentiation, where resident groups are sporadically connected to the pelagic population, may explain the origin of this unique resident population of bottlenose dolphins along the Chilean coast.

AB Mate choice experiments are essential to further our understanding of sexual selection, but can be challenging to design and conduct with most wild animals. 3D printing technology is creating opportunities to conduct mate choice experiments in the field by facilitating the production of biologically accurate decoys. We used pairs of 3D printed female decoys differing only in size to test whether free-ranging male northern map turtles, Graptemys geographica, prefer larger females. Males interacted and attempted to mate significantly more with the larger decoys. By selecting larger females, males should increase their fitness because of the correlation between female size and hatchling size. Our experiment demonstrated that 3D printing technology can be a valuable tool to study animal behaviour in the field. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   DEER; TRADE-OFFS
AB Segregation between the sexes or related to age and/or reproductive status is common in many animal taxa, particularly in dimorphic species. The causes of this segregation remain difficult to disentangle, despite numerous attempts. This is probably due to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient data on animal behaviour (e.g. habitat use, activity budgets) and group composition (age/sex and reproductive status) during the various phases of the species' reproductive cycle. Based on an intensive long-term monitoring of a Mediterranean mouflon, Ovis gmelini musimon x Ovis sp., population, we concurrently assessed five hypotheses for segregation linked to forage selection (FSH), reproductive strategy (RSH), social preference (SPH), activity budget (ABH), and weather sensitivity (WSH). We found marked segregation between most age/sex classes. Age-dependent segregation among males was increasingly marked as their age difference increased and segregation between the sexes also increased as males became older and larger. Over the year, segregation between sex, age and reproductive status classes was lowest during the rut. We also observed the highest synchrony of activity in groups composed of individuals of similar age/sex class or reproductive status. Females occurred closer to both secure and high-quality food habitats, especially during the lambing and rearing periods, whereas males used less secure and lower quality habitats as they aged. Differences in habitat use between age/sex classes provided partial or full support for the RSH and FSH. Large males were preferentially observed at higher altitude than females during hot summer days to buffer against heat stress, in agreement with the WSH. A preference for interacting and grouping with peers that express similar activity patterns (ABH and SPH) appears to be the main driver of segregation in this population. Our study confirms the strong multifactorial nature of segregation in ungulates. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reproductive promiscuity, whereby females are fertilized by extrapair mates, is common. The frequency of extrapair fertilizations (EPFs) depends on at least three sources of variation. First, females may differ in their proneness to being fertilized by extrapair males. Second, males may differ in traits that affect realized promiscuity of females. Third, EPF decisions depend on the combined effects of the identity of social mates. Here, we relied on extensive genetic parentage analysis of the offspring of a socially monogamous bird, the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, to assess which of the above sources of variation predict the occurrence of EPFs. When we controlled for pair composition and social mate attractiveness, EPFs covaried with morphological and coloration traits of feathers in females. As expected, females mated with highly ornamented, long-tailed males had fewer EPFs. The composition of the breeding pair also accounted for variation in EPFs, implying that the ability of individual males to secure genetic parentage varies between female mates. These results show that females differ in promiscuity, and phenotypic traits of females that are visible to males are associated with promiscuity, potentially serving as cues to prospecting males. Hence, contrary to common interpretations of the negative relationship between male sexual attractiveness and female promiscuity, it can be speculated that larger genetic parentage by highly ornamented males results from their ability to secure the less promiscuous mates rather than from females being less promiscuous when mated to them. Moreover, our study shows that EPFs also depend on the composition of the social pair, as expected if a component of female promiscuity decisions depends on genetic or behavioural compatibility with the social male mate. Our study emphasizes that female promiscuity and its phenotypic correlates, and composition of the social pair, deserve closer attention in studies of sexual selection mediated by EPFs.

AB Many territorial animals interact less aggressively with neighbours than with strangers, a phenomenon known as the 'dear enemy' effect, although some species show the opposite behaviour. Rock hyraxes, Procavia capensis, are social mammals that communicate via a rich acoustic repertoire. Male hyraxes produce elaborate advertisement calls (i.e. songs) both spontaneously and in response to occasional attention-grabbing events (e.g. pup screams, agonistic interaction), as well as to conspecific male songs. When replying to conspecific songs, male hyraxes tend to respond more to familiar males than to strangers, reflecting the 'nasty neighbour' effect. Our study relates to the general question of why some species respond aggressively towards neighbours, while others are more aggressive towards strangers. We hypothesized that male hyraxes eventually familiarize themselves with a stranger, subsequently perceiving its intentions as highly threatening and deserving of a vocal response. To simulate the presence of a stranger in the area we exposed wild hyrax groups to playbacks of natural songs of unfamiliar hyraxes. Male rock hyraxes became more likely to reply to a stranger's song over time, but this was independent of the number of times they heard the song. This suggests that either (1) the threat presented by a stranger increases when it is no longer perceived as transient or (2) because listeners do not physically encounter the stranger, they perceive replying aggressively as a low-risk response. Our work implies that species may demonstrate a range of condition-dependent behaviours instead of a dichotomy between the 'nasty neighbour' and 'dear enemy' strategies.

AB Behavioural adjustments to predation risk may impose costs on prey species. While the vigilance eforaging conflict has been extensively investigated, other important fitness-related behaviours exclusive to scanning, such as grooming, have been overlooked. Yet, risk perception is expected to be more accurately assessed in these contexts as food-related parameters should not interfere. We studied individually recognizable impalas, Aepyceros melampus, and questioned the factors that shape maternal decision making in two exclusive components of maternal care with high benefits and costs: scanning for predators and grooming offspring to remove parasites. While studies generally infer prey alertness level, used as a proxy of risk perception, from the observed investment in vigilance, the vigilance eallogrooming context gave us the opportunity to directly assess alertness during the time spent head-up, and then to investigate its sources of variation and its consequences for allogrooming probability. We found a strong decrease in allogrooming probability when maternal alertness increased. Mothers were more alert in open (grassland) than in closed (bushland) habitats at a large scale. Increasing group size led both to lower maternal alertness and higher proportion of suckling time spent allogrooming, but only when surrounded by low vegetation, the reverse being true in high vegetation. Finally, mothers suckling female calves were more alert. Our results underline the determinant role of habitat, shaping both offspring predation risk and the relative conspicuousness or protective value of group mates. We discuss the potential fitness costs associated with the antipredatoreantiparasite trade-off faced during maternal care. Our results suggest that prey behaviours other than foraging are essential to identify factors shaping risk perception. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sex differences in adult behaviour are well documented, but less is known about the ontogeny of these differences. In mammals, the transition to independence, from infancy to the juvenile period, is when these sex differences are likely to become prominent. Here, we examined sex differences in behavioural development among calf and juvenile bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, from 2 years preweaning to 2 years postweaning and whether these differences were consistent, or not, with three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses regarding the function of the juvenile period: the social skills, protection/safety and energy allocation hypothesis. All hypotheses received some support, but strikingly so for females. First, sex differences in the nature and quality of juvenile social bonds appear to foreshadow adult association patterns. Juveniles had a greater proportion of same-sex associates than calves. Second, although neither sex increased their number of associates from infancy to juvenility, a pattern that might mitigate predation risk, avoidance between juveniles and adult males suggests that both sexes reduce the likelihood of conspecific aggression. This pattern was more marked for juvenile females. Third, females, but not males, increased foraging rates from late infancy to the early juvenile period, even surpassing typical adult female foraging rates. This is likely related to the future energetic demands of maternal investment and skill development required for specialized foraging tactics, which are female biased in this population. This study provides a first step towards understanding the transition into independence for cetaceans, insight into how sex differences develop and a glimpse into the function of the juvenile period.

AB Fighting involves the repeated performance of demanding agonistic behaviours and winners usually fight more vigorously than losers. While 'vigour' describes the rate and duration of a behaviour, 'skill' refers to well-coordinated motor movements. We investigated the role of skill in animal contests for the first time, focusing on the shell-rapping behaviour of hermit crabs during contests over the ownership of gastropod shells. We quantified vigour by recording the total number of raps and the mean number of raps per bout, and we quantified skill by measuring the distances that attackers displaced their shell during each rap. Winners displaced their shells through shorter distances than losers, indicating that motor pattern, as well as vigour, differed between contest outcomes. Both vigour and skill improved as fights progressed for eventual winners, but worsened for losers. We suggest that in a contest, skilful motor movements allow vigorous fighting, and both aspects deteriorate with fatigue. Skill may be important in the wide range of contests where outcomes are driven by energetic constraints. Understanding the links between skill, vigour and energy could provide new insights into strategic decision making during animal contests. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Most studies examining rodent ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) have investigated pericopulatory vocal behaviour in polygynous rodents, while vocalizations related to pair bond maintenance in monogamous rodents remain unexplored. In the monogamous California mouse, Peromyscus californicus, we used ultrasonic playbacks and post-playback social interactions to assess possible functions of USVs. We found that females responded with approach towards USVs of an unfamiliar male (bonded male from another pair) compared to a noise control, but displayed no difference in response to calls of their partner versus noise. Responsiveness to unfamiliar males does not appear to reflect an interest in extrapair copulations because during post-playback social interactions, females displayed more agonistic behaviours and fewer affiliative behaviours towards unfamiliar, sexually naive 'stranger' males than towards their partners. We speculate that approach to unfamiliar male USVs instead may be related to territorial defence. We further explored associations within the data set. Interestingly, female affiliation with her partner was predicted by USV output, particularly a higher number and proportion of complex call types, produced during the male partner USV elicitation phase. Female approach towards USVs was related to syllable duration of one call type in partner USVs (not in unfamiliar USVs) but no other features, and sufficient variation exists in syllable duration to allow females to theoretically distinguish between individuals based on this measure. Similarly, while pregnancy state did not influence female social behaviour, it decreased approach to playback of partner USVs but not to that of unfamiliar USVs. Overall, our results illuminate concepts about vocal communication in monogamous rodent species with strong pair bonds and suggest that functions of USVs in rodents can extend beyond mate choice.

AB Domestication drives changes in animal cognition and behaviour. In particular, the capacity of dogs to socially learn from humans is considered a key outcome of how domestication shaped the canid brain. However, systematic evidence for social learning from humans in other domestic species is lacking and makes general conclusions about how domestication has affected cognitive abilities difficult. We assessed spatial and social problem-solving abilities in goats, Capra hircus, using a detour task, in which food was placed behind an inward or outward V-shaped hurdle. Goats performed better in the outward than in the inward detour without human demonstration. Importantly, a single presentation by a human solving the inward detour resulted in goats solving the task faster compared to the inward detour without demonstration. Furthermore, eight of nine subjects that received a demonstration used the same route as the demonstrator in the subsequent trial. Thus, goats learn socially from humans. This provides strong evidence for social learning from humans in a domestic species other than dogs. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Salticids are known for their complex predatory behaviour, which is based on the analysis of visual information from their prey, but the role of cues used in different predatory tasks is poorly known. We investigated which cues are used to identify the preferred target on the prey's body, examining the reactions of the euryphagous salticid Yllenus arenarius to various virtual prey presented on a miniature screen. We manipulated the number of head-indicating details (ranging from prey with four details, including a head spot, antennae, legs and wings, to prey lacking any details), the position of these details in relation to motion direction (in the leading versus in the trailing part of the body), the local motion of legs and the presence of horizontal motion. When all cues pointed to the same body end the spiders identified the preferred target almost unerringly regardless of the number of details. Movement alone, movement combined with a different number of details in the leading part, local motion of legs and head spot alone on motionless prey elicited the same reactions. When the cues provided contradictory information (motion direction and details pointing to opposite body ends) the spiders struck the trailing end more often the more details were placed there, and they visually inspected body ends of their prey before attack. These results indicate that the spiders used the direction of the prey's motion and the complexity of head-indicating details when making decisions related to strike targeting. These findings elucidate the role of motion and the complexity of details forming 'false heads', an antipredator adaptation assumed to redirect predatory strikes on prey from various animal groups. We demonstrate that in stationary prey even very simple patterns efficiently redirect predatory strikes. We provide the first experimental evidence of the effectiveness of 'false head' complexity in moving prey. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB People have written about habituation, a process that leads to decreased responsiveness to a stimulus, as well as its counterpart, sensitization, or an increased responsiveness to a stimulus, for over 2000 years. And, while intensive research in the last century has led to well-supported generalizations about mechanisms of habituation, we have not developed a 'natural history' of habituation and tolerance that would help us predict, based on life history and natural history variation, how species will respond to humans and anthropogenic stimuli. The need for predictive models has never been greater. In this essay I will review generalizations about these learning processes and point out how a clear understanding of mechanism can be used to inform wildlife management and generate testable management interventions. I will also highlight unanswered questions about habituation and sensitization, and establish the groundwork for developing a natural history of habituation and tolerance.

AB A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether sex differences, developmental history, stimulus number and/or characteristics affect the speed of auditory discrimination learning of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, as tested in a Go/No-go task. Our results indicate that sex, early life conditions (brood size and juvenile body size), the number of stimuli, type of stimuli (constructed from zebra finch song elements or human speech syllables) and type of discrimination (based on phonetic characteristics or sequential structure of sounds) significantly influenced learning speed. Learning speed was faster if birds were female, reared in larger broods or were larger as juveniles. Greater numbers of stimuli and human speech-based stimuli were harder to learn than fewer stimuli and stimuli consisting of zebra finch song elements. Stimuli differing in phonetic characteristics were learned faster than those varying in structure. Additionally, there was some evidence of stable individual differences in performance across experiments. Our findings demonstrate that discrimination learning can be affected by factors that have been suspected to, but not yet definitively shown to, have impacts on learning. We suggest that examining the learning process itself in more detail by quantifying individual differences in learning strategies may provide more information on how various factors affect variation in learning abilities.

AB Animals adjust their behaviour over time and contexts to cope with ecological and environmental variation. However, the presence of consistent between-individual differences in behaviour (i.e. personality) suggests that individual behaviour may be less flexible than previously thought. Here, we tested whether the size of the experimental tank and the ontogenetic stage of individuals affect estimates of average and consistent individual variation in activity and risk-taking behaviours in the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, a fish model widely utilized for behavioural research. We measured risk taking and activity in juvenile, subadult and adult mosquitofish in a standard open-field test, in which the size of test tank varied linearly. We found strong evidence that spatial constraints alter mosquitofish behaviour. In particular, we observed that average activity increased with tank size, while the willingness of fish to take risks was independent of tank size. Moreover, juvenile fish exhibited, on average, lower risk-taking behaviours than older individuals. We highlight that the use of differently sized tanks may result in unequal variation in the average behaviour between juvenile and older fish, with escaping abilities of juvenile fish being underestimated in small environments. Most interestingly, we observed that variation in tank size triggered changes in the individual rank order for both risk taking and activity in juvenile fish, thus altering their personality estimates. In contrast, adult fish maintained consistent individual rank orders across all tank sizes. This study supports the hypothesis that behavioural repeatability increases with age, suggesting that personality estimates on adult animals may be less vulnerable to variation in laboratory contexts than those on juvenile ones.

AB Recent studies have established that variation in background level of risk has profound effects on antipredator phenotypes. Elevated levels of background risk not only change behaviour, but also physiology, morphology and cognitive function. A variety of prey show neophobic predator avoidance when exposed to short-term elevation in risk. Such phenotypically plastic responses allow prey to balance behavioural trade-offs in the face of uncertain risks. Here, we test the hypothesis that ontogeny functions as a constraining factor in the induction of neophobic predator avoidance. In a series of laboratory trials, we exposed convict cichlids, at three different ontogenetic stages (eggs/wrigglers, juveniles and adults), to conditions of elevated (versus low) risk and tested their response to a novel predator odour (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss). When cichlids were exposed as eggs and newly hatched 'wrigglers' and tested 21 days later, they showed a significant antipredator response to trout odour. When exposed as similar to 18 mm juveniles, cichlids showed a significant avoidance when tested 24 h post-exposure, but not 21 days post-exposure. However, when conditioned as similar to 50 mm adults, we found no evidence of induced neophobia. Combined, these results suggest that ontogenetic stage may limit phenotypically plastic neophobia.

AB In many species, aggressive individuals outcompete their less aggressive conspecifics for resources such as food and access to mates. Nevertheless, variation in aggression is maintained in populations, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that aggressive behaviours compromise the antipredator behaviour of prey, which would link aggressive behaviours to a cost of predation. We presented computer-animated images of predators to the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher either during territorial contests with a group of territory intruders or when the test fish were alone. We investigated their response latencies and the behaviour directed towards predator images. We found that test fish responded to the predator images significantly later during territorial contests than when they were alone. Moreover, during territorial contests, response latencies of test fish increased with increasing levels of aggression towards conspecifics. Test fish also responded more aggressively to the predator images during territorial contests than when they were alone. During territorial contests, fish that responded later to the predator images were more aggressive towards these images. Our findings suggest that territorial contests compromised the ability of prey to respond quickly to predators. However, we propose that increased aggression towards predators might increase survival chances of prey during predator encounters in nature, and it may thus compensate for costs incurred by delayed predator responses during territorial contests. To test this hypothesis experiments under natural predation regimes that examine the relationship between predation risk, territorial and antipredator aggression are required.

AB The diversity of secondary sexual signals across animals has led evolutionary biologists to hypothesize an important role for sexual selection in the process of speciation. Testing this hypothesis typically focuses on male female mating interactions and divergence in female mate preferences between populations, leading to behavioural reproductive isolation. While informative, these tests rarely account for the potential contributions of male male competitive interactions and male mate preferences to speciation. By incorporating male and female behavioural data across a genus of colourful freshwater fishes (Percidae: Etheostoma), our results suggest coevolution between male signals and aggressive responses and a potential role for male mating biases alongside female mating biases in the evolution of behavioural isolation between allopatric species. These surprising results imply an important function for male behaviours in trait divergence and the evolution of reproductive isolation, suggesting that a broader view of sexual selection is vital to addressing its role in speciation.

AB Animals of many different species discriminate among individuals based on acoustic properties of vocalizations. These vocalizations are produced in different contexts, including territorial defence and parenteoffspring interactions. They are also produced in response to predators, but we know less about whether animals, especially birds, are able to discriminate among individuals based on antipredator calls. We therefore examined whether an avian species (peafowl, Pavo cristatus) is able to differentiate between the antipredator calls of different individuals. Using a habituation-discrimination playback paradigm, we habituated peahens to the antipredator calls of a given individual and then examined their responses to additional calls from that individual and to calls from a novel individual. We found that peahens responded more strongly to calls from the novel individual than from the original individual, demonstrating that they are able to differentiate between individuals based on the acoustic properties of antipredator calls. The ability to differentiate between individual callers may be useful to peahens in modifying their antipredator behaviour based on signaller reliability.

AB Intraspecies differences are fundamental to natural selection, yet individual differences in cognition in free-living populations have received little attention. Proactive and reactive coping styles describe individual differences in personality and related stress physiology; however, the coping style model can be extended to include predictions regarding measures of cognition. We compared two measures of personality (neophobia and exploratory behaviour) included in the coping style model to cognitive performance on colour-based associative and reversal learning tests in adult Florida scrub-jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens. Also, as exogenous glucocorticoid treatment can affect cognitive performance, we examined whether an individual's naturally occurring physiological phenotype, reflected by corticosterone measures obtained during development and at the time of the learning tests, covaried with learning performance. Performance on associative and reversal learning tests were inversely related. Scrub-jays with low levels of corticosterone as 11-day-old nestlings performed better on an associative learning test as adults, and there was a marginally nonsignificant trend for nestlings with high levels of corticosterone to perform better on a reversal learning test. There was also a marginally nonsignificant trend for neophobic birds to perform better on reversal learning tests. There were no relationships either between adult stress-induced corticosterone levels and learning, or between exploratory behaviour and learning. Our findings provide evidence that variation in sensitivity to environmental conditions, as reflected by an individual's coping style, underlie the specific strategy by which individuals perform cognitive tasks (i.e. cognitive style). Florida scrub-jays experience a trade-off in performance between types of learning that covary with early corticosterone exposure. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The maintenance of multiple morphs in warning signals is enigmatic because directional selection through predator avoidance should lead to the rapid loss of such variation. Opposing natural and sexual selection is a good candidate driving the maintenance of multiple male morphs but it also includes another enigma: when warning signal efficiency differs between male morphs, why would females choose a phenotype with lower survival? We tested the hypothesis that indirect responses to selection on correlated characters through sexual selection may substantially shape the evolution of male coloration. If male phenotypes differ in their fertilization ability, female choice against the best surviving phenotype can evolve. The wood tiger moth, Parasemia plantaginis, has two coexisting male morphs in Europe. Previous studies have shown that yellow males are better defended against predators, but that white males have a higher mating success. We examined differences in fertility between white and yellow males in terms of sperm production, number of sperm transferred and rate of sperm replenishment, and association between these fertility traits, female mate choice and reproductive output. If white morphs have greater fertility than yellow males, then this could explain why females prefer to mate with white males. However, we did not find any difference between male colour morphs either in mating probability, fertility (i.e. sperm availability and sperm transferred) or reproductive success (i.e. number of eggs laid and hatching success). We discuss our results in relation to context-dependent mating success and maintenance of colour polymorphism within populations. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Competition and, ultimately, adaptive specialization are the major ecological forces behind spatial segregation in foraging distributions, and are commonly driven by size-related differences in competitiveness between individuals of different sex, age or social status. However, such segregation can also be observed in long-lived monomorphic species, often between immature and breeding individuals. In many of these species, individuals often forage in patchy and potentially unpredictable environments in which resources can be spread over large scales and be difficult to find, and efficient foraging may require advanced cognitive skills (for example in navigation and memory). Particularly in species with deferred breeding, experience rather than size may be an important driver of segregation and may lead to differences in competitiveness between young and old, but whether there is a relationship between age, foraging efficiency and spatial segregation has never been properly investigated. Here we tested this hypothesis by simultaneously tracking individuals at different life stages in a longlived seabird, the Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus, during a period of central-place foraging around the colony, to investigate spatial segregation, and by measuring foraging efficiency by combining an ethoinformatics approach and mass gain. We found substantial spatial segregation between immature and breeding adults. Compared with adults, immatures gained less mass per unit of time spent foraging and foraged in less productive waters, suggesting lower foraging efficiency, probably because of inexperience.

AB Asymmetric weapons are common in bilateral animals and, in some species, they can occur on either the left-or the right-hand side of the body (lateralization). Fiddler crabs (Uca spp, Decapoda: Ocypodidae) have an enlarged claw that is used in male-male combat over territories and in courtship displays. Males can be either right-or left-handed, and most species have a 1:1 ratio. Past studies have found little effect of handedness on fighting success, fight duration or other measures of combat. Here we show that, while handedness per se, does not affect fighting, handedness matching has a significant effect. In Uca mjoebergi, fights between different-handed males were more likely to escalate to grappling, suggesting that it is harder for the combatants to determine the winner. We suggest that the positioning of the claws during fighting creates distinct forces that result in different outcomes for same-versus different-handed fights. This can represent a strong selective pressure in populations with an uneven handedness distribution where the handedness minority will often engage in different-handed fights. We discuss these results in light of the selective forces that may act on handedness distribution in fiddler crabs.

AB Behavioural consistency is a key assumption when evaluating how between-individual differences in behaviour influence life history tactics. Hence, understanding how and why variation in behavioural repeatability occurs is crucial. While analyses of behavioural repeatability are common, few studies of wild populations have investigated variation in repeatability in relation to individual status (e.g. sex, age, condition) and over different timescales. Here, we aimed to fill this gap by assessing within-population variation in the repeatability of docility, as assessed by the individual's response to human handling, in a free-ranging population of European roe deer, Capreolus capreolus. Docility was an equally repeatable behaviour at both short- and long-term timescales, suggesting that this behavioural trait is stable across time. Repeatability did not differ markedly between age and sex categories but tended to be higher in juvenile males than in juvenile females. Finally, contrary to expectation, individual variation in the repeatability of docility was not correlated with individual body mass. Further studies are required to assess the life history consequences of the individual variation in docility we report here. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Collective choices of a food source are generally thought to arise from the amplification of individual preferences. However, costs associated with foraging can also influence food choice: animals faced with a poor-quality food source may either continue feeding on it (a conservative strategy), or search for a potentially more profitable one (a more risky strategy). Groups of nomadic, trail-following Malacosoma disstria caterpillars were offered a leaf of two different hosts, either side by side to determine preference, or at a distance to investigate how exploration costs affect food choice. Arenas with and without pheromone trails were used to distinguish between direct travel costs and unknown territory costs. When two leaves were side by side, groups of second-instar caterpillars showed clear preferences between host trees, whereas groups of fourth-instar larvae did not. When the two leaves were distant from each other, groups of second-instar caterpillars usually remained on the known source, irrespective of food preference or group size. These groups were more likely to relocate to a preferred food source when pheromone trails were present, suggesting that trails effectively decrease unknown territory costs. Groups of fourth-instar caterpillars were more likely to leave the known food source even when no trail was present, suggesting a developmental shift in costs associated with exploration. Our results show that collective choices reflect food preference when exploration costs are low (second-instar larvae with pheromone trails), but not when they are high (second-instar larvae without trails). Such a conservative foraging strategy can be adaptive if the exploration costs of leaving a known food source are greater than the potential benefits of discovering a better alternative, for example, in a homogenous environment like that of a tree.

AB Scent marking is an important means of communication in mammals and many species elevate their scent marks by depositing them on vertical objects. Traditionally, it has been assumed that marks are elevated to increase detectability, but elevated marking may have evolved to convey information about depositor size. Because the height of an elevated mark is typically dictated by the height of the marker, receivers could use the physical location of an elevated scent deposit to indirectly assess the size, and hence the competitive ability, of rivals. Considering that intrasexual competition is one of the primary motivators of mammalian scent marking, and that the ability to assess a rival indirectly would provide very real benefits (eliminating the need for potentially dangerous encounters), it would be surprising if species were not utilizing mark height in this way. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether any mammal extracts such information from elevated scent marks. I tested whether wild dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, discriminate between handstand scent deposits of differing height. Handstand marking is an extreme form of elevated marking, with the marker balancing on its forepaws while flinging its hind legs into the air and smearing anogenital secretions one full body length above the ground. I found that females spent twice as long investigating anal-gland deposits positioned 16 cm above the ground, as compared with those at 10 cm, even though the two were swipes of the same scent deposit and presumably did not differ chemically. A faeces presentation experiment showed that females were more interested in obtaining information about same-sex than opposite-sex conspecifics. I suggest that female dwarf mongooses, which experience extreme intrasexual competition, use the height of handstand scent marks as an indicator of depositor size, allowing them to concentrate their information gathering on same-sex rivals that pose the greatest threat.

AB Friend of a friend relationships, or the indirect connections between people, influence our health, wellbeing, financial success and reproductive output. As with humans, social behaviours in other animals often occur within a broad interconnected network of social ties. Yet studies of animal social behaviour tend to focus on associations between pairs of individuals. With the increase in popularity of social network analysis, researchers have started to look beyond the dyad to examine the role of indirect connections in animal societies. Here, I provide an overview of the new knowledge that has been uncovered by these studies. I focus on research that has addressed both the causes of social behaviours, i.e. the cognitive and genetic basis of indirect connections, as well as their consequences, i.e. the impact of indirect connections on social cohesion, information transfer, cultural practices and fitness. From these studies, it is apparent that indirect connections play an important role in animal behaviour, although future research is needed to clarify their contribution.

AB The study of construction behaviour and animal architecture has yielded significant insights into many areas of animal behaviour including decision making, optimal foraging and behavioural plasticity. In addition, the fitness consequences of constructing nests, protective structures and traps have been amply demonstrated. However, surprisingly little effort has gone into the study of what happens when these structures become damaged. Here we used the orb spider Araneus diadematus to explore repair behaviour of its web, with the aim of understanding environmental and structural influences on the repair process. The primary function of a spider web is to catch prey, so its structural integrity is of critical importance. However, orb webs are fragile structures and often become damaged, leading to the need to either repair or rebuild the web. Environmental conditions such as wind increase the likelihood of damage to the web. Here we first described and analysed the full repair process and quantified how effectively the repair restores structural integrity. Second, we investigated how wind affects repair behaviour and the spiders' anticipation of damage or motivation to repair. We found that spiders followed the same sequence of behaviours to repair damage to their webs and the repair significantly increased the effective web area following damage. Spiders reacted more quickly to damage in windy conditions, suggesting that they are attuned to the greater likelihood of damage in wind. Total repair time was the same in windy and control conditions, but repair was less effective in windy conditions. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sexually selected variation in male body size is often associated with alternative reproductive strategies that may persist under frequency-dependent selection or result from 'making the best of a bad job' in inferior individuals. The spider genus Nephila is well known for female gigantism and male dwarfism, serving as an established model system to investigate selection on male size and the still enigmatic sexual size dimorphism (SSD). Less attention has been paid to the enormous size variation among males that exists in some Nephila species despite broad evidence for large male advantages in contest competition. As the existing variation contradicts strongly biased fitness returns among different phenotypes, detailed investigations of fitness consequences related to different body sizes and their associated mating strategies are required. We used the African golden-silk spider Nephila senegalensis to test whether size-dependent alternative mating strategies yield equivalent reproductive success in dyads of size-mismatched males competing for a single female. Our results confirm that differently sized males achieve similar paternity and reveal complex interrelations between competing strategies, which mutually influence each other. Males integrate their own competitive ability, the intensity of sperm competition and female reproductive value to adjust their mating investment accordingly. Size-related mating strategies, combined with behavioural flexibility, may thus promote the maintenance of male size variation by balancing fitness returns and exemplify how changes in selective context can dissolve the principal large-size benefits. We suggest that flexible adaptive responses may significantly contribute to stabilizing SSD. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In various animal species individuals differ consistently in their behaviour, often referred to as personality. In several species these personality differences also correlate with differences in social behaviour. This is important as the social environment is a key selection pressure in many animal populations, mediated, for example, via competition or access to social information. Using social network analysis, recent studies have furthered our understanding of the role of personality in the social environment, usually by focusing on swarming or flocking populations. However, social associations in such populations are fundamentally different from those in territorial populations, where individuals meet less frequently and where the costs and benefits of spatial associations differ from those for swarming or flocking species. In this study we therefore tested whether social network position is related to individual differences in exploration behaviour, an established measure of an avian personality trait, using a wild, territorial, personality-typed great tit, Parus major, population. By means of novel, large-scale, automated tracking (Encounternet) we show, while controlling for average territory distance, that slower exploring males had less central social network positions. Yet, slower explorers overall did not travel shorter distances than faster explorers, indicating that a less central social network position was not merely a consequence of lower activity. Finally, males with less central social network positions did not have reduced breeding success compared to males with more central positions. Our results suggest that territorial individuals influence the structuring of their own social environment in relation to their personality. This is relevant, because the establishment of social relations and familiarity with possible competitors is predicted to be important in many territorial populations.

AB Conserving migratory species is difficult because wide-ranging animals are challenging to study and aspects of their annual cycles occur in geographically distant areas. This challenge is illustrated by the hundreds of thousands of migratory bats killed annually during autumn migration by industrial wind turbines. It is unknown why bats are killed at turbines because they are so difficult to observe during migration. A conservation behaviour approach has potential to explain what is, arguably, the most significant environmental impact of wind energy. We tested predictions of two hypotheses to explain the presence of bats at turbines: (1) bats are attracted to visually conspicuous tall structures during autumn migration; (2) attraction is linked to social behaviour rather than foraging. We compared acoustic activity of migratory tree bats at conspicuous tall structures (telecommunication towers) to activity at two types of control sites (woodlot edges: consistently attractive to bats; open fields: consistently unattractive) before and during migration. Activity of migratory bats increased dramatically at towers during migration, from low premigration levels, to exceed that at open fields and match that at woodlots. Moreover, the proportion of feeding calls at towers remained low while the proportion of events during which multiple bats visited the towers simultaneously increased during migration to surpass that at woodlots and open fields. This suggests that migratory bats actively visit tall structures during migration for reasons other than foraging. Exploiting this behaviour, and the abundance of communication towers on the landscape, could reveal critical information about migratory behaviour of bats and help guide site selection for wind energy projects. Our findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the behaviour of migratory species at all stages of their annual cycle for effective conservation.

AB Multiple mating by females is taxonomically widespread and intensively studied from the perspective of why females mate with many males. In many multiply mating species, females can vary substantially in mating frequency, but the causes of this variation are not well understood. We used directed mating to explore the causes of variation in mating frequency in a harvester ant whose queens mate an average of 10 times but where naturally occurring mating frequency ranges from 2 to 15 mates. Matrilines differed in mating frequency and especially in their probability of mating with the first male lineage that they encountered. Differences in matriline mating frequency were not related to differences in female size among matrilines. Male mating success was not correlated with the order in which males encountered females, suggesting that male success may depend on which matrilines they encounter. Our results suggest that variation in mating frequency may be a consequence of differences among matrilines due to additive genetic and/or maternal effects, as has been found in other species.

AB Prior contest outcomes often affect subsequent contest behaviour (winner/loser effects). If contestants discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar opponents, individual recognition may alter the strength and/or manner of winner/loser effects. We examined whether hermit crabs, Pagurus middendorffii, changed their contest behaviour based on winner/loser effects, whether they distinguished a familiar opponent from an unfamiliar opponent, and how the familiarity with the opponent related to the winner/loser effects in male-male contests. Males of this species show precopulatory guarding behaviour, and male-male contests often occur between a guarding male and an intruder. In contests between unfamiliar males, intruders use self-assessment during the initial contact phase and mutual assessment during the physical combat phase to determine their behaviours. Precopulatory guarding males and females collected in the field were used in two consecutive trials of male-male contests. Losers in the first trial were used as focal intruders in the second trial with (1) a familiar opponent that had won the first trial, (2) an unfamiliar opponent that had won the first trial with another intruder, or (3) a naive opponent with no trial experience. Focal intruders did not alter their aggressiveness against either unfamiliar or naive opponents in the second trial. However, they rarely initiated physical combat against familiar opponents in the second trial. When they initiated combat, they gave up sooner against familiar opponents than against unfamiliar opponents. These results suggest that intruders are able to distinguish familiar opponents from others and decrease their aggressiveness only when they encounter familiar opponents. Our study therefore shows loser effects in P. middendorffii related to the familiarity with the opponent and suggests intruders can obtain information about their opponents during the initial encounter.

AB In species in which both sexes have similar ornamentation, the ornaments often function as sexual or social signals in both sexes. However, males and females may use ornaments in different signalling contexts. We previously demonstrated that carotenoid-based bill colour of female American goldfinches, Spinus tristis, functions as a signal of status during intrasexual, but not intersexual, competition. Here we test whether male bill colour functions as a competitive status signal during both intra-and intersexual contests. We tested whether focal males and females avoided feeding adjacent to taxidermic male models as a function of the models' experimentally altered bill colour. We additionally tested whether male bill colour functions as a mate choice signal by presenting females with a choice of two live males with experimentally altered bill colour. In the status signal experiment, neither focal males nor females avoided male models with more colourful bills, as was predicted by the status-signalling hypothesis. These results indicate that male bill coloration does not function as a signal of competitive status and that the signal function of male bill colour does not parallel that of female bill colour. In our mate choice experiment, females showed no preference for male bill colour, suggesting that male bill colour may have some yet untested signalling function or that male bill colour may no longer be under selection. Our findings suggest that selection can lead to different signalling strategies in males and females, even in species that express mutual ornamentation.

AB In the ant species Tetramorium caespitum, collective foraging relies on group mass communication in which successful scouts lay a recruitment trail but also guide a group of nestmates to the food source. We conducted experiments to understand how group leaders may improve the success of recruits in reaching the food source and whether they adjust their leading behaviour to their audience, that is, to the following response of recruits along the foraging journey. We characterized the trajectories of leaders by measuring their straightness, angular deviation, maximal amplitude and walking speed. Trajectometric values highlighted that a straight path coupled with a slow walking speed increased the probability of followers reaching the food whereas leaders that walked at higher speed and deviated far from the food-nest beeline were more likely to lose recruits. Leaders did not seem to heed their audience since they did not reduce their speed or their path sinuosity after the loss of a recruit along their outbound journey. Information transfer about food resources by T. caespitum leaders is thus targeted towards a restricted number of recruits but without the informed individuals exerting any control over the following response of their audience. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of group recruitment compared with simpler or more sophisticated forms of information sharing and we debate the status of group recruiters regarding the concept of leadership in animal groups.

AB Warning colours can deter predators from attacking unpalatable or toxic prey. These colours are avoided by predators, either innately or by learned response through trial and error. Predators that have learned these signals can also generalize their responses to similar colours. Much of the previous research on warning colours has examined long-wavelength colours (e.g. orange and red) and little is known about short-wavelength coloration (e.g. blue) in warning signals, despite its presence in unpalatable animals in many different taxa. We determined whether prey with only blue coloration, only orange coloration, and with both colours elicited innate avoidance from a naive predator (Gambel's quail chicks, Callipepla gambelii), as well as how effectively the signals were learned and generalized. Prey were composed of pieces of mealworm (palatable or unpalatable) beneath a coloured paper tent. Blue did not elicit any innate avoidance, whereas orange and a combination of both colours (orange-and-blue) were effective at deterring naive predators. Predators were able to learn the association between colour and unpalatability most effectively for orange prey, but also learned this association for blue and for orange-and-blue prey. Predators showed asymmetrical generalization, in which birds were more likely to generalize from the colour they learned as unpalatable (conditioned stimulus) to orange prey and orange-and-blue prey than to blue prey. We conclude that orange is likely a more effective warning colour to these birds, but blue can still be learned alone and when displayed adjacent to orange.

AB The decision to consume toxic prey is a trade-off between the benefits of obtaining nutrients and the costs of ingesting toxins. This trade-off is affected by current state: animals will consume more toxic prey if they are food deprived. However, whether the trade-off is affected by developmental history is currently unknown. We studied the decision to eat quinine-injected mealworms in adult starling siblings that had been exposed to either high or low levels of food competition as chicks, via a brood size manipulation. At the time of our experiments, the two groups of birds did not differ in size, body weight or current environment. Each bird was presented with the toxic prey while living on a high-quality diet and a low-quality diet. We found an effect of diet, with birds consuming more toxic prey while on the low-quality diet, and also of developmental history, with birds from the high-competition brood size treatment eating more toxic prey than their low-competition siblings. The effects of brood size treatment were not completely mediated by early growth, although we did find evidence that early growth affected toxic prey consumption independently of brood size treatment. We discuss our results in relation to adaptive developmental plasticity and the developmental origins of behavioural variation. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB The factors that drive within-species variation in animal space use remain poorly understood. A growing body of evidence suggests that both home range attributes and biological interpretations of the home range may depend fundamentally on the scale of analysis. We utilize a multiscale mixed effects modelling framework to examine how seasonal fluctuations in climate, food resource abundance and group mass affect variance in home range area and the maturity stage of forest used by a group-living Neotropical primate, the white-faced capuchin, Cebus capucinus. Using an 8-year data set representing over 20 000 contact hours, we estimated home ranges for seven social groups at four nested temporal scales and three nested spatial scales using a movement-based kernel method. Group mass was consistently the most important predictor of home range size in our models, and its effects were relatively insensitive to spatial or temporal scale. Mean daily maximum temperature was an influential factor in shaping monthly range area and composition, with hotter weather favouring smaller home range size and increased use of mature evergreen forest. Greater fruit availability was also associated with smaller monthly range area. The effects of temperature and fruit availability were both scale dependent: the impact of both variables was greatest on the core zone. The different study groups showed marked variation in the habitat composition of their home ranges, but in all groups, higher-use zones consisted of older, more evergreen forest. Our study illustrates the complex ecological processes that affect movement behaviour in a Neotropical primate across a range of spatial and temporal scales, highlighting the importance of group mass, climatic seasonality, landscape heterogeneity and dietary shifts in shaping the home range.

AB Sexual selection predicts that mate choice increases individual fitness. Infection by parasites (from eukaryotes to bacteria or viruses) can reduce this individual fitness, altering the infected individuals' sexual traits and molecular cues. In this case, one would expect to observe mechanisms for avoiding infection during mate choice. The vast majority of host responses to infection in terms of mate choice are intended to avoid infection, but the costs of mate choice can also hinder infection avoidance. This paper highlights the main limitations in current knowledge and empirical experiments, and summarizes the key factors that should be taken into account to test the hypothesis of infection avoidance in mate choice: the time of host-parasite coevolution in the biological interaction implied, the choosy sex tested (male, female or both) and the genetic background of the individuals tested.

AB Play behaviour is common across mammals, but it is particularly frequent in primates. Several explanations for the occurrence of play have been proposed, both adaptive and nonadaptive. One popular explanation is that play supports the development of complex cognition and behavioural flexibility. This hypothesis is supported by a relationship between the relative size of several brain regions, including the neocortex and cerebellum, and the frequency of social play. However, a direct link with either behavioural flexibility or brain maturation has yet to be shown. Using a comparative data set of the frequency of social and nonsocial play across primates, I tested two predictions of this hypothesis: (1) that the frequency of play is associated with the amount of postnatal brain growth; and (2) that the frequency of play is associated with measures of behavioural flexibility. I found support for both predictions, and, notably, the results suggest that social and nonsocial play may contribute to different aspects of behavioural flexibility.

AB Alternative reproductive tactics of males have been studied in many species, but few studies have focused on females. In many communally breeding mammals, females can be adult nonbreeding helpers, leave the group and breed solitarily, or be a breeder in their natal group, representing three alternative reproductive tactics. The reasons for delayed breeding are not well understood, but in many sociable species both male and female helpers are reproductively suppressed. Male helpers of communally breeding striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, have increased corticosterone levels and delayed sexual maturation compared with their singly housed brothers. In the present study, we tested whether similar effects occur in female striped mouse helpers. In the field, young adult females typically do not breed in their natal group, indicating that they might be reproductively suppressed. Seventeen sister pairs from 17 family groups were studied. One sister of each pair was kept in the family group, while the other was housed singly at 3 weeks of age. Sisters did not differ in either the age at which they reached puberty (at 6 weeks on average) or in their corticosterone and progesterone levels. However, in neutral encounter tests, singly housed sisters showed more amicable behaviours when presented with unfamiliar striped mice of both sexes. Their high sociable motivation might explain why most females remain philopatric under natural conditions. We conclude that philopatric female striped mice in monogamous family groups are not reproductively suppressed, but reproductive competition might occur in natural communal groups with multiple old breeding females, as observed under high population density.

AB Anthropogenic disturbances present challenges to animals. Behavioural plasticity is one way that animals adjust to degraded habitats. In the present study, we examined how ecological conditions impact reproduction of female red colobus monkeys, Procolobus rufomitratus, in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Wrangham (2002, Behavioural diversity in chimpanzees and bonobos, pp. 204-215) proposed the 'cost of sexual attraction' hypothesis to explain the relationship between ecology and female reproduction. Here for the first time we test and expand on this hypothesis in a folivorous species, the red colobus monkey. We compared four groups of red colobus, two in previously logged areas and two in old-growth areas, to examine differences in female reproductive behaviours and physiologies. We predicted that, because of differences in food availability, females living in logged areas would (1) have a shorter duration of genital tumescence, (2) mate less frequently and (3) constrain mating behaviours more to periods of maximal genital tumescence compared to females in old-growth areas. As predicted, females in logged areas were fully tumescent for a significantly shorter period, copulated significantly less frequently and showed mating behaviours when fully inflated significantly more than females in old-growth areas. This behavioural plasticity contributes to the maintenance of female reproductive function in the face of environmental constraints associated with anthropogenic disturbance that influences food resources.

AB Behavioural syndromes have received much attention by behavioural ecologists in recent years. While the relationship between boldness across contexts and between boldness and aggression are frequently investigated, little is known about how these relationships might change because of environmental disturbances such as exposure to endocrine disrupters. 17 alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2) is an oestrogen mimic that is prevalent in aquatic ecosystems worldwide and has severe, negative impacts on the behaviour and physiology of exposed organisms. To assess how EE2 affects boldness and decision making, male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, received repeated trials of three boldness assays (novel environment, empty tank and novel object) and one decision-making assay (a dummy male and female presented simultaneously) before and after exposure to acute, nominal doses of EE2. A control group of males received the same number of trials but was not exposed to EE2. When subjects were unexposed, a behavioural syndrome was found for boldness across contexts. In addition, boldness was positively correlated with aggression in the decision-making context. EE2 exposure disrupted this behavioural syndrome. In summary, EE2 exposure reduced overall behavioural response in all contexts, disrupted the behavioural syndrome and reduced behavioural consistency. Thus, even nominal, short-term exposure to EE2 can have dramatic effects on multiple levels of behaviour and potentially generate severe fitness consequences on exposed aquatic species. This study provides the first evidence of a boldnesseaggression syndrome in this species and demonstrates that pollution may negatively influence consistent individual differences in behaviour.

AB In many signalling systems, intraspecific variation in recognition abilities is based on developmental stage, experience or caste. However, the occurrence of intraspecific variation in recognition has not been thoroughly examined in species with individual recognition. For example, previous work has shown that individual recognition is an important aspect of the social life of Polistes fuscatus (paper wasp) nest-founding queens, as individual recognition stabilizes dominance interactions and reduces aggression. To date, the potential for individual recognition among P. fuscatus workers has been largely ignored. Here, we explore whether there is intraspecific variation in individual recognition by testing P. fuscatus worker recognition abilities in a series of staged contests. The results indicate that P. fuscatus workers are capable of individual recognition: focal workers paired with previously encountered partners experienced significantly less aggression and more nonaggressive bodily contact than focal workers paired with unknown social partners. We propose two potential explanations for individual recognition among workers: (1) worker individual recognition may be favoured because it provides social benefits to workers, or (2) worker individual recognition may be a byproduct of selection for individual recognition in foundresses. Individual recognition is often considered a cognitively challenging form of recognition, so future studies that compare the sophistication of recognition across castes will be useful to assess whether there are more subtle differences in cognitive abilities or recognition behaviour between P. fuscatus nest-founding queens and workers.

AB Although models of colony organization in social insects often rely on the assumption that within-group variation increases group performance, empirical support for this is mostly confined to studies of genetic variation. However, workers in ant or bee colonies often vary in behaviour and morphology even when genetic variation is low. Bumblebees provide a unique opportunity to explore the consequences of such variation: colonies have a wide range of worker body sizes compared to other social bee species, and workers also vary in response thresholds (i.e. stimulus levels at which workers respond by performing a task), in spite of queens being singly mated (and thus, low genetic variation). Here we test how body size and response threshold diversity affect colony performance in two unrelated in-nest tasks (thermoregulation and undertaking). We manipulated worker diversity using worker removals to restrict threshold or body size variation within the colony. We also quantified the degree of intracolony variation across colonies and related this to colony performance. In general, colonies took longer to cool the nest after bees were removed, but there was no significant effect of treatment on fanning or undertaking success. Furthermore, when intracolony variation was analysed as a continuous variable, we found no effect on colony-level thermoregulation or undertaking performance. Instead, average threshold was a more useful predictor of thermoregulation success, and colonies with a narrower range of size variation had more success at undertaking. These results emphasize the importance of understanding how different types of variation (e.g. behavioural, morphological, etc.) contribute to colony performance.

AB A paper by Caraco, Martindale and Whittam (1980, Animal Behaviour, 28, 820-830) transformed foraging behaviour research by the fundamental realization that actions in nature only rarely have precisely predictable outcomes. They showed that the consequences of risk, understood as the unpredictability and variance of consequences, must play a central role in functional and mechanistic analysis of animal decision processes. Here we examine the article's theoretical and experimental contribution with the benefit of over three decades of hindsight, review developments in the intervening time and discuss the future. Our review confirms previous ones showing that although the earliest results supported the predictions of the original models, a full analysis of the literature does not. In spite of a likely positive publication bias, the majority of studies fail to support a shift from risk proneness when in negative energetic budget to risk aversion when in positive budget, as embodied in the budget rule, and the proportion of failures increases with time. Furthermore, re-examining the earlier experiments we conclude that support should not have been expected, mostly because they implausibly assumed that all probabilities were known to the subjects. We argue that such assumptions should be abandoned, being replaced by realistic, evidence-based models of learning and information processing, such as associative learning and Weber's Law. Our overall message is that models are research tools that can be fecund even if they are transformed and even refuted with the passage of time and the associated accumulation of knowledge.

AB Nest defence is a particularly costly component of parental care. The costs of nest-related behaviours are affected by the nest's location, size and architecture; yet surprisingly little is known about how choice of a nesting site or nest characteristics are adjusted as a response to the threat of future nest predation. To address this topic, we investigated whether egg predation threat influenced nest choice and nest construction in the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus, a small marine fish with exclusive paternal egg care. We found that exposure to sand shrimp, Crangon crangon, a predator of sand goby eggs, did not affect male preferences for large nesting resources or the onset of nest-building activity. Small and large males did, however, respond differently to the presence of shrimp during the nest-building phase. In particular, large males used more sand to cover their nests in the shrimps' presence. By contrast, neither the presence of egg predators nor male size class affected the size of the nest entrance. Together, our results show that while the risk of future egg predation may not necessarily influence a male's decision to nest, during the nest construction phase it can nevertheless induce responses that strongly depend on builder phenotype.

AB Elaborate solicitation displays are a common feature of interactions between care-givers and offspring. These displays are interpreted as the phenotypic expression of the conflict of interests between parents and offspring over parental investment. Offspring typically have siblings and thus do not exist in isolation. Therefore, they may adjust their begging in response to their siblings' begging, either competitively or cooperatively. Alternatively, begging may be independent of the begging efforts of siblings. Studies of avian begging have primarily focused on nestlings, where offspring are immobile and compete directly over the allocation of parental resources. We investigated the influence sibling begging had on individual fledgling begging in the cooperatively breeding pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor. Using experimental manipulations, we found that fledgling begging behaviour was negatively correlated with satiation and unrelated to the begging effort of siblings. Pied babbler care-givers were able to target increased provisioning to individuals with artificially increased demand while maintaining provisioning rates to the rest of the brood. Thus, fledglings were found to incur no provisioning costs or benefits from either increased or decreased begging by their siblings. We propose that the combination of targeted provisioning, flexible levels of provisioning and the dispersed nature of fledglings reduces the benefits of competitive or cooperative begging in this species.

   GENETICAL EVOLUTION
AB Explaining cooperative behaviour is a fundamental issue for evolutionary biology. The challenge for any cooperative strategy is to minimize the risks of nonreciprocation (cheating) in interactions with immediate costs and delayed benefits. One of a variety of proposed strategies, the raise-the-stakes (RTS) strategy, posits that individuals establish cooperation by increasing investment across interactions from an initial interaction. This model has received little quantitative support, however, probably because individuals of many social species engage in repeated interactions from a young age. In some situations, however, such as following conflicts, after prolonged absences or during social instability, established relationships may become unreliable predictors of future behaviour, creating an environment for RTS. We investigated grooming interactions among wild male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, testing RTS in these specific contexts. We found evidence to support the view that male chimpanzees employed RTS during social instability, but not under the other conditions. However, we also found that the duration of episodes (discrete parcels) of grooming was negatively related to aggression risk and in consequence suggest that the patterning of grooming interactions indicative of RTS was less to do with preventing cheating, and more to do with avoiding the elevated risks of intramale aggression during the period of social instability. We interpret the apparent support for RTS in our data as a by-product of the way chimpanzees cope with fluctuating (here, elevated then diminishing) risks of aggression. We suggest that social instability raises the stakes for grooming by creating a more hazardous marketplace in which to trade. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Close associations between adult males and females are rare among group-living, nonmonogamous mammals but may mark the transition from life in promiscuous bisexual groups to groups of pairs or pair living. Although heterosexual friendships have been described in baboons, these are short-term affairs serving as protection against infanticide and thus tightly linked to the presence of vulnerable infants. Long-term association may be adaptive in situations of low male monopolization potential where it pays to invest in a particular female partner instead of spreading the effort among many females. Using long-term data, we investigated male-female and male-infant associations in wild Assamese macaques, Macaca assamensis. Group-wide and individual male-female associations were stable for at least 2 or 3 years. Association during the mating season but not before the mating season predicted male mating success, lending support to the 'friends with benefits' but not the 'mating effort' hypothesis. Mating success in turn predicted male-female association at birth as well as male-infant association before weaning. In support of the 'paternal care hypothesis' paternity was an independent predictor of male-infant association beyond weaning age, creating potential for true paternal care. We thus postulate that particular demographic and life history circumstances may favour male-female friendships by creating a positive feedback between male-female-infant associations driven by paternal care and male-female associations promoted by increased mating access to drive the evolution of long-term male-female bonds.

AB The mechanisms that shape animal movement decisions at the level of an individual or a group of animals can scale up to affect larger-scale ecological processes. Ecologists often use mechanistic animal movement models to understand these links, but animal movement models rarely connect empirically with an understanding of how animals actually decide to move around in their environment. To better understand this relationship, we compared the travel behaviour of two sympatric mammal species that have broadly similar diets: brown capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella nigritus, and ring-tailed coatis, Nasua nasua. According to most mechanistic animal movement models, species that exploit the same resources should show similar movement patterns. Although the fruit component of coati and capuchin diets is very similar, coatis primarily feed on invertebrates in the leaf litter or soil, while capuchins forage on invertebrate prey in the forest canopy. We found that these two species showed markedly different movement patterns: while capuchins typically travelled between fruit trees in relatively straight lines, coatis had significantly more tortuous daily travel paths and frequently visited the same fruit trees more than once per day. These circular coati travel paths would not be predicted by most foraging models. We posit that these differences in coati and capuchin movement patterns are driven by differences in arboreal and terrestrial travel costs, exploitation of fallen fruits and shifts in foraging behaviour over the course of the day. Because these seemingly small differences between the two species lead to major differences in movement behaviour, we posit that animal movement models need to better incorporate (1) travel costs, (2) both directed travel and random food search and (3) realistic diet models that include resources with different nutrient compositions.

AB Female mate choice copying is assumed to increase the opportunity for sexual selection; however, this phenomenon has only been evaluated for a few species in the wild. This study confirmed the presence of female mate choice copying in a wild population of the paternal brooding blenny Rhabdoblennius nitidus, with the behaviour of the first copying females being repeatedly copied by subsequent females. Usually, parental phase males have lower mating success than courtship phase males; however, we manipulated parental phase males to mate with a demonstrator female, causing these males to be repeatedly chosen by other females. We then tested the benefit of mate choice copying in the wild. Our observations of female mate sampling do not support the hypothesis that mate choice copying causes a decline in the number of nests visited by females, time spent mate sampling and male harassment. All copying females mated with males tending the eggs of other females, whereas the majority of other females mated with males not tending eggs. Thus, it is highly possible that copying behaviour reduced the risk of egg desertion by males, which occurs when small numbers of eggs are tended.

AB Avian vocal mimicry has been studied for decades, but little is known about its function or requirements for accurate imitation. Furthermore, progress is hampered by the difficulty in identifying which vocalizations are indeed mimetic. We tested historical claims of vocal mimicry in the brown thornbill, Acanthiza pusilla, using a combination of human and computer methods to identify mimicry, followed by comparisons of acoustic similarity with model vocalizations. We recorded vocalizations of brown thornbills and sympatric heterospecifics while undisturbed and during mist net capture or the presence of natural or model predators. We then cross-validated human classification of mimicry with computer classification based on spectrographic measurements and spectral cross-correlation. Finally, we quantified the accuracy of the most common imitations. Brown thornbills predominantly imitated alarm calls given by heterospecifics towards aerial predators, which function in these models to provoke immediate flight by receivers. Human and computer-based methods produced consistent results when identifying and classifying mimicry. Mimicked aerial alarms were not perfect imitations of their corresponding model alarms, but did retain specific acoustic properties previously shown to be important for provoking immediate alarm responses. Although less accurate mimicry may reflect physiological constraints, we suggest that mimetic function, perhaps startling predators, only requires mimicry to retain features of model alarms that provoke immediate alarm responses by receivers. Understanding what factors influence the acoustic structure of mimetic vocalizations is essential in understanding the evolution of vocal mimicry, particularly with accumulating evidence that mimetic function does not always require perfect resemblance in other sensory modalities.

AB There is a long-standing debate within the field of sexual selection regarding the potential projection of stereotypical sex roles onto animals by researchers. It has been argued that this anthropomorphic view may be hampering research in this area, for example by prioritizing the study of male sexual adaptations over female ones. We investigated how males and females are described in the sexual cannibalism literature. Sexual cannibalism is a specific form of sexual conflict and is highly gendered, with females generally cannibalizing males. We found that females were more likely to be described using active words and males with reactive words. This is contrary to recent results from a survey of the sexual conflict literature. While this reversed gender bias may arise from the nature of sexual cannibalism, our results nevertheless indicate an alternative form of sexual stereotyping. A number of the words used to describe cannibalistic females were highly loaded and suggestive of a negative stereotype of sexually aggressive females. To make progress we suggest first that animal behaviour researchers recognize both the costs and benefits of looking for general patterns as part of the scientific method. Although necessary, the search for general patterns may validate existing stereotypes or provide the basis for new ones. Additionally, we suggest that the field of sexual behaviour research is neither wholly bad nor good in terms of language use but that we should work towards a consensus of how and when we use particular terms to describe sexual behaviour.

AB Ambient noise can interfere with signal transmission and detection across many taxa and modalities. Evidence suggests that, over time, signals evolve to minimize interference from ambient noise and other signalling animals. Less well studied is the possibility of short-term behavioural responses to transient ambient noise, in which animals actively adjust signal parameters to recover signalling efficacy. Here we test animals' capacity to adjust vocal signal parameters in the face of transient acoustic interference. In field trials we monitored the songs of territorial male black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, determined the frequencies of their 'fee-bee' songs, and broadcast tones to closely mask subjects' 'bee' notes. We also presented control nonmasking tones of 5 kHz, well above birds' song frequencies. Our main finding was that males responded to masking tones by shifting song frequencies after an average of 66.4 s from tone onset, whereas frequency shifts in the presence of nonmasking tones occurred only after an average of 95.8 s. The quicker shift in frequencies in the face of masking noise provides new evidence for vocal behavioural plasticity, and further reveals how behavioural plasticity together with evolutionary adaptations can minimize the detrimental effects of ambient noise on communication.

AB Both recognition and conventional signals are widespread in the animal kingdom. Chemical communication plays a major role in invertebrates, and especially in social insects. In the last decade, observational and experimental evidence has shown the existence of visual quality signals and individual recognition cues in Polistes paper wasps, meaning that visual communication might also be common in insect societies. Here we show that two species of facultatively eusocial hover wasps (Vespidae, Stenogastrinae) use the visual channel for social communication. By combining morphoanatomical measurements and behavioural assays, we found that the size of the dark facial markings was related to reproductive status and dominance in colonies of Liostenogaster vechti, thus representing a badge of status. By contrast, no correlation between facial coloration and reproductive status was found in Liostenogaster flavolineata, which instead used facial markings as familiar visual recognition cues. Our results reveal that visual communication in social insects might be more widespread than previously thought and has evolved independently in distinct wasp taxa facing similar selection pressures.

AB The social brain hypothesis states that selection pressures associated with complex social relationships have driven the evolution of sophisticated cognitive processes in primates. We investigated how the size of cooperative primate communities depends on the memory of each of its members and on the pressure exerted by natural selection. To this end we devised an evolutionary game theoretical model in which social interactions are modelled in terms of a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma played by individuals who may exhibit a different memory capacity. Here, memory is greatly simplified and mapped onto a single parameter m describing the number of conspecifics whose previous action each individual can remember. We show that increasing m enables cooperation to emerge and be maintained in groups of increasing sizes. Furthermore, harsher social dilemmas lead to the need for a higher m in order to ensure high levels of cooperation. Finally, we show how the interplay between the dilemma individuals face and their memory capacity m allows us to define a critical group size below which cooperation may thrive, and how this value depends sensitively on the strength of natural selection.

AB In some egg-laying species, parents provide care by regulating the hatching pattern for embryos because the survival and growth of offspring are influenced by the timing of hatching. Burrower bugs, Adomerus rotundus (Heteroptera: Cydnidae) exhibit maternal care including defence against predation and provision of food. We found that A. rotundus mothers displayed physical vibration (shaking the body rhythmically) while maintaining the egg-guarding posture, i.e. holding the egg mass under the thorax between the forelegs and midlegs. We sought to ascertain whether A. rotundus mothers induce synchronous hatching by this physical vibration. The peak in maternal vibrations coincided with the time when most embryos hatched from their eggs. To investigate the effect of the presence of a mother on hatching synchrony, we conducted an experiment in which the mother was removed immediately before hatching. The control broods, which experienced continuous guarding from the mother, hatched synchronously, while the experimental broods, which had been isolated from the mother, hatched more asynchronously. To ascertain whether embryos hatch specifically in response to the vibrational signal, we exposed mature egg masses to an artificial vibration and monitored hatching patterns. The artificial vibration induced synchronous hatching. These results strongly suggest that A. rotundus mothers promote synchronous hatching actively using physical vibration.

AB Although sexual selection is undeniably important in the evolution and maintenance of ornamental traits, it remains an unsuitable explanation for juvenile ornamentation. Maleemale competition has been important in the evolution of UV-blue plumage ornamentation in birds, suggesting that this type of plumage may signal status more generally. In the present study, we compared dominance status of juvenile Florida scrub-jays before and after experimental plumage manipulation and found that plumage reflectance signalled status. Maleemale competition is important in maintaining UV-blue plumage ornamentation in adults of other species. However, our evidence shows that sexually dimorphic ornamentation can also mediate competition over food resources in juvenile Florida scrub-jays. Understanding status signalling among juveniles may yield insights into differences in fitness, especially in species with cohesive social systems where early interactions are likely to influence future competitions over resources or mates.

AB Begging behaviour in birds is frequently studied in nestlings, but the function of adult female begging behaviour remains unknown. We examined begging behaviours of adult female yellow warblers, Setophaga petechia, during incubation at the northern limit of their breeding range. Female yellow warblers beg only when their mate arrives at the nest, and vocalization duration, intensity of wing fluttering and position of the female's body on the nest varies between begging events. We measured changes in these characteristics for 696 begging events from nine incubating females and examined how begging intensity changed with temperature and time since a female's last feeding. Begging intensity increased as the duration between feedings increased especially during colder temperatures. Next, we investigated how male feeding rates changed in response to variation in female begging intensity. Males fed females more quickly in response to intense begging during warm temperatures but not during cold temperatures. Finally, we investigated whether male feeding rates influenced the frequency or duration of the female's bouts away from the nest (i.e. 'off-bouts') during which the female had the opportunity to forage. Females that were fed more frequently reduced the average duration, but not the frequency, of their off-bouts. These results suggest that variation in the intensity of female begging behaviour signals energetic need, and that begging during incubation may be an important adaptation allowing female yellow warblers to maximize incubation time when breeding in sub-Arctic environments.

AB Epidemiological studies of malaria or other vector-transmitted diseases often consider vectors as passive actors in the complex life cycle of the parasites, assuming that vector populations are homogeneous and vertebrate hosts are equally susceptible to being infected during their lifetime. However, some studies based on both human and rodent malaria systems found that mosquito vectors preferentially selected infected vertebrate hosts. This subject has been scarcely investigated in avian malaria models and even less in wild animals using natural host-parasite associations. We investigated whether the malaria infection status of wild great tits, Parus major, played a role in host selection by the mosquito vector Culex pipiens. Pairs of infected and uninfected birds were tested in a dual-choice olfactometer to assess their attractiveness to the mosquitoes. Plasmodium-infected birds attracted significantly fewer mosquitoes than the uninfected ones, which suggest that avian malaria parasites alter hosts' odours involved in vector orientation. Reaction time of the mosquitoes, that is, the time taken to select a host, and activation of mosquitoes, defined as the proportion of individuals flying towards one of the hosts, were not affected by the bird's infection status. The importance of these behavioural responses for the vector is discussed in light of recent advances in related or similar model systems. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Escape behaviours are generally considered adaptive because of their obvious effects on fitness. However, little is known about the genetic basis of escape responses. The estimation of the magnitude of hereditary factors affecting variation in escape responses indicates their potential to evolve by natural selection. Scallops are exceptional among bivalve molluscs because they possess an excellent swimming capacity, which helps them to escape predators. In this study we estimated the narrow-sense heritability (h(2)), phenotypic variance components and phenotypic and genetic correlations of several escape response traits (i.e. reaction time, number of claps (rapid valve closures and openings), and the duration and intensity of the clapping response) in juvenile Argopecten purpuratus scallops. We stimulated scallop escape responses using their natural predator, the sea star Meyenaster gelatinosus. Genetic estimates for escape response traits were determined by the animal model. Most studied traits showed substantial amounts of additive genetic variance controlling their phenotypic variation (CVA = 18.43-100.2), were repeatable (at least over a short period, R = 0.36-0.42), and had significant heritabilities (h(2) = 0.36-0.57). Indeed, it can be inferred that most of the analysed escape response traits of A. purpuratus could evolve through natural selection. Moreover, significant genetic correlations between some escape response traits were observed, suggesting that selection acting on one escape trait will affect that of another, facilitating their coevolution.

AB Indicator models of sexual selection suggest that honest mating signals are costly to produce or maintain. Animals that use extended phenotypes as courtship signals may be able to reduce these costs in a given year by reusing nonbodily ornaments acquired during previous years, perhaps affecting signal honesty. I examined whether male great bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus nuchalis, are able to reduce the annual costs of signal production by reusing bower decorations acquired during previous years. I paired males that had similar numbers of bower decorations and removed decorations from one member of the pair. Males that had decorations removed from their bowers collected more decorations from the environment the following year than did control males, and they tended to steal more decorations. However, they had fewer decorations at their bowers than did control males, most likely because control males reused almost 50% of the decorations that they had acquired during previous years. These results suggest that individuals that accumulate nonbodily ornaments can reduce the costs of signal production in subsequent years; and that resource accumulation can lead to differences in both behaviour and display quality between individuals that do and do not accumulate resources. I also found a positive correlation between the number of decorations at bowers before removal and the number of decorations acquired by males after removal, suggesting that decoration numbers indicate a male's past condition and present performance.

AB Social learning probably functions as a mechanism to acquire public information about food, predators and conspecifics, without paying the costs required for individual learning. Social learning should be strategic rather than indiscriminate, and although it is often suggested that animals should show conformity ('copy the majority strategy'), there are surprisingly few tests of this idea. Our goals were to test experimentally whether social learning plays a role in boldness behaviour of wild and domesticated zebrafish, and to investigate whether they utilize similar social-learning strategies and conformity in their boldness behaviour. We tested whether timid wild-derived zebrafish become bolder, and more likely to approach a moving stimulus, after interacting socially with bolder domesticated fish (and vice versa). We found that wild zebrafish exposed to domesticated fish were bolder than controls, whereas domesticated fish exposed to the more timid, wild zebrafish did not differ in their boldness score compared to controls. The changes in the behaviour of wild fish persisted after the nonfocal groups were removed; however, we found no evidence for conformity. Our findings indicate that zebrafish use social learning for assessing risk and adapt their social-learning strategies to the costs of a perceived risk. Future studies should be able to utilize this model species to incorporate genetic and genomic tools to study the development and evolution of social learning.

AB We examined how the web structure of host spiders affects the locomotor ability of the kleptoparasitic spider Argyrodes kumadai. We compared two populations of A. kumadai differing with respect to whether the host used was Agelena silvatica (Agelenidae) or Cyrtophora ikomosanensis (Araneidae). The barrier web of Agelena had a higher thread density than that of Cyrtophora, which presumably constrains locomotion of A. kumadai in Agelena webs. A reciprocal transplant experiment into different webs revealed that, in complex webs, the A. kumadai population using Agelena as a host walked faster than the A. kumadai population using Cyrtophora; however, no such difference was found in simple webs. This suggested that A. kumadai using Agelena are better adapted to the webs of their native host with regard to their locomotor ability than are A. kumadai using Cyrtophora. The prey capture success of A. kumadai, as estimated by the foraging response of the host to prey and the walking speed of A. kumadai, revealed that the population of A. kumadai using Agelena captured larger prey much more frequently than the population using Cyrtophora. Thus, the greater locomotor ability of A. kumadai using Agelena appears to be adaptive for enhancing prey acquisition in Agelena webs where prey-stealing opportunities are severely limited. We conclude that both physical web architecture and the foraging behaviour of the host are important selective agents on locomotor ability in Argyrodes.

AB Floral signals are typically emitted across multiple sensory modalities, although why they are multimodal is unclear. One possible explanation is that multimodal signalling ensures that at least one signal component will be transmitted effectively under varying environmental conditions (the 'efficacy backup' hypothesis). For example, by transmitting both component A and B, a signaller can communicate under environmental conditions where transmission of component A is reduced; component B 'backs up' A. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether a floral scent could back up a floral colour signal when light levels were low. We trained nectar-foraging bumblebees to discriminate rewarding and unrewarding targets that differed in colour, scent, or both colour and scent, and then presented the targets at different levels of illumination. We measured bees' accuracy at distinguishing the two targets and their rate of visits to the trained target. Performance on both measures declined under low light when targets were unscented. The presence of scent reduced the loss of accuracy under low light, supporting the efficacy backup hypothesis, but this effect depended upon the colour of the previously rewarded target. In contrast, the presence of scent did not affect the overall rate of correct visits under low light (correct visits/foraging time). A backup mechanism that maintains accuracy, but not rate of nectar collection, does not necessarily benefit the pollinator. However, it most likely benefits the plant through reduced pollen wastage. In short, multimodal floral signals may benefit the plant by improving pollen transfer, while not benefiting the pollinator. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Reciprocation is thought to favour altruism among nonrelatives. Three types of reciprocity have been proposed: direct, indirect and generalized. All three are theoretically possible, but their role in real biological systems is unclear. We concurrently examined the occurrence of direct, indirect and generalized reciprocity during grooming exchanges in longtailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis. The occurrence of the grooming monkey A gave B predicted the latency and occurrence of the grooming B gave back to A (direct reciprocity), the latency of the grooming A received from C (indirect reciprocity), but not the grooming B gave C (generalized reciprocity). The duration of the grooming monkey A gave B predicted the latency and occurrence of the grooming B gave back to A (direct reciprocity) but not the grooming A received from C (indirect reciprocity) or the grooming B gave C (generalized reciprocity). Finally, monkeys directed overall more of their grooming to those individuals that overall groomed them more (direct reciprocity), but not to those that groomed other individuals more (indirect reciprocity); nor did monkeys that received overall more grooming groom others more (generalized reciprocity). Overall, we found strong evidence for direct reciprocity, limited support for indirect reciprocity and no evidence for generalized reciprocity. Our results support the view that direct reciprocity plays a crucial role in the life of primates and suggest indirect and generalized reciprocity are rare or absent in nonhuman animals. We argue that direct reciprocity may be driven by a system of partner-specific emotional bookkeeping of past social interactions that does not require complex cognitive capacities.

AB Because ejaculate production can impose substantial costs, males are expected to allocate sperm prudently. Such strategic ejaculate allocation can represent male mate choice when it varies with female traits. Since sperm transfer is often difficult to measure directly, many studies rely on proxies such as copulation duration. Previous work in the simultaneous hermaphrodite sea slug Chelidonura sandrana showed that longer copulations occurred with larger or sexually isolated partners, indicating strategic ejaculation. However, the underlying assumption of a tight correlation between copulation duration and sperm transfer remained untested. Using a novel, nonlethal sperm-counting method, we show that sperm transfer in C. sandrana occurred at a predictable rate only early during copulation but subsided thereafter. As a result, total sperm counts varied independently of copulation duration, making the latter an unreliable proxy for sperm transfer. Our work offers perspectives to revisit strategic ejaculation in C. sandrana and to study in detail the fitness effects of consecutive copulatory phases.

AB Mate localization in insects that use acoustic, vibrational or visual displays often involves a maleefemale duet. Female signals provide cues not only to the duetting male, but also to competitors that may attempt to disrupt the duet. Mate localization based on substrate vibrations may be especially vulnerable to such disruption, because localizing vibrations is difficult, and mating success often depends on localization efficiency. We tested the hypothesis that a specialized signal produced by male treehoppers, Tylopelta gibbera, disrupts competitors' duets. This hypothesis predicts that the signal occurs during competition to locate a female, and that it decreases the frequency of female responses. We first characterized the search paths of single males duetting with a female. Males walked along host plant stems, frequently stopping and producing signals that elicited female replies. Males made forward/reverse decisions only after the female responded and their accuracy decreased with distance from the female. We then characterized the behaviour of two males duetting with the same female. Single males never produced the putative disruption signal, but pairs of males frequently did, timing it to overlap with the rival's signal. The overlapping signal strongly decreased female responses, both during natural signalling interactions and in response to playbacks. Males took longer to localize the female in the presence of a competitor. The overlapping signal apparently functions to reduce the directional information available to competing males, probably through signal masking. This is one of the few experimental demonstrations of a specialized signal whose function is to disrupt communication. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Observational field studies were conducted on two remote populations of feral horses in Australia to determine whether lateralization is a characteristic of Equus caballus as a species or results from handling by humans. Group 1 had been feral for two to five generations and Group 2 for 10-20 generations. In both groups, left-side biases were present during agonistic interactions and in reactivity and vigilance. Therefore, as in other vertebrates, the right hemisphere appears to be specialized to control agonistic behaviour and responses to potential threats. The leftwards bias was stronger in measures of behaviour involving more aggression and reactivity. Preferences to place one forelimb in front of the other during grazing were also determined. No population bias of forelimb preference was found, suggesting that such limb preferences present in domestic horses may be entrained. Since stronger individual limb preferences were found in immature than in adult feral horses, limb preference may be modified by maturation or experience in the natural habitat. Stronger limb preference was associated significantly with elevated attention to the environment but only in younger feral horses. No sex differences in lateralization were found. The findings are evidence that horses show visual lateralization, as in other vertebrates, not dependent on handling by humans. Limb preference during grazing, by contrast, does appear to depend on experience. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During courtship, specific signals are transmitted and received between the male and the female. To understand the evolution and function of courtship behaviours, these signals must be tested individually to determine their relative effects. Drosophila species have a variety of courtship patterns that use different sensory modalities, including chemosensory, tactile, visual and auditory cues, and thus provide an opportunity for exploring different sensory modalities. In most species of the Drosophila willistoni group, males produce an auditory cue (courtship song) through wing vibration. One species, Drosophila nebulosa, does not produce an auditory signal in courtship, although both sexes perform wing-lifting movements and males fan an anal droplet towards the female. We compared the sensory modalities important for mating success in D. nebulosa and D. willistoni through a series of phenotypic manipulation experiments in which individuals had disrupted transmission or reception of signals. In D. nebulosa, females had to be able to smell, presumably to detect the anal droplet, for successful mating to occur, whereas for males of the same species, vision was essential. In contrast, no single sensory modality was absolutely necessary for D. willistoni mating success, although hearing greatly increased mating success for females and courtship song greatly increased mating success for males. Thus, these species are divergent in the sensory modalities necessary for courtship success, indicating that courtship behaviour may change rapidly within species groups.

AB Individual behavioural differences, consistent over time and/or across situations, have been included under the term of personality. These behavioural differences have been shown to affect a variety of major ecological traits, all of which have a strong effect on the fitness of the individual. However, the personality of an individual could also have a strong influence on the decisions of other individuals, in situations such as selecting or avoiding a social companion or a mate. Under this scenario, indicators of different personalities would have evolved, but the possible signalling of personality has received little consideration to date. We hypothesized that birds can signal their personality through feather coloration and tested this hypothesis in siskins relating different colour patches to their exploration score. To measure exploration, we presented the siskins with a novel object and calculated how long they took to approach it. We found that siskins with larger black bibs showed shorter approach latencies. This finding supports the idea that plumage coloration traits can provide information about personality traits of the bearer. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Behavioural endocrinologists have shown that stressors including competition for resources can affect an individual's circulating level of cortisol, whereas agonistic interactions typically affect androgen levels. Conservation biologists have used such data to facilitate the restoration and management of biodiversity by monitoring social interactions and stress among individuals and species. Here, we examined whether competition and agonistic interactions with non-native salmonids is hindering restoration of native Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, in Lake Ontario. Using semi-natural streams, we examined the effects of competition with non-native brown trout, Salmo trutta, and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, on plasma cortisol and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) concentrations in juveniles from three Atlantic salmon strains, as well as the relationship between these hormones and social dominance and growth. Basal hormone levels and the hormonal response to the presence of the trouts varied among the strains. Cortisol increased in the presence of the trouts for two strains and was associated with lowered aggression and food consumption. Conversely, the presence of the non-native species had little influence on overall concentrations of 11-KT in the Atlantic salmon, although unexpectedly, there was a negative relationship between 11-KT and initiated aggression when either one of the trouts was present. Interestingly, elevated 11-KT levels were associated with declines in both food consumption and growth. Overall, our results suggest that competition with non-native salmonids negatively impacts Atlantic salmon. We discuss how our results can improve poststocking success and restoration of Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The macroparasite Xenos vesparum affects both the behaviour and the physical traits of its host, the social wasp Polistes dominulus. Female wasps, if parasitized, do not perform any social tasks and desert the colony to gather at specific sites, where the parasite mates; at the end of summer they form prehibernating clusters joined by healthy future queens to overwinter. Parasitized wasps become highly gregarious. In April, healthy wasps leave the aggregations to found new colonies, while parasitized wasps remain in overwintering groups and release parasites to infect wasp larvae only later in the season. We studied the prolonged gregarious behaviour of parasitized wasps and analysed the morphology of parasitized and healthy wasps in aggregations collected over a 7-year period to determine whether the parasite affects host size, wing symmetry, ovarian development and lipid stores. All parasitized wasps were smaller and had undeveloped ovaries and more wing fluctuating asymmetry than unparasitized wasps, irrespective of time of year, parasite load and parasite sex. If infected only by one or two X. vesparum females, the wasps had large fat bodies, which could facilitate their overwintering. In contrast, wasps infected by at least one male parasite had little lipid and died at the end of the summer. Thus, X. vesparum, may play a role in the fate of its host, by exploiting wasps' tendency to form aggregations outside the colony and by altering its caste system, nutrient allocation, diapause timing and life span to achieve its own reproduction and dispersal.

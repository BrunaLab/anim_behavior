AB During agonistic interactions the motivation of each contestant is expected to vary because of increased information and changes in fighting ability. In shell fights between hermit crabs over gastropod shells, attackers rap their shell in a series of bouts against that of the defender whereas defenders remain withdrawn into their shells until the encounter is resolved; either the defender is evicted from its shell or the attacker 'gives up' and the defender retains its shell. We assessed the motivational state of attackers for performing rapping by measuring the duration of startle responses elicited by a novel stimulus. We staged fights between pairs of crabs in six different groups defined by the potential gain in shell quality available to attackers (high or low) and by the point at which the novel stimulus was applied (prior to rapping, after one bout or after four bouts). Startle response duration decreased during the first four bouts of fighting and showed a U-shaped relationship with the relative difference in size between the crabs. There was, no difference in startle response duration between high- and low-gain groups. Individuals showing short startle responses were likely to be victorious and we conclude that the relationship between the relative size difference of the opponents and. startle duration reflects that between size difference and the cost of gaining an eviction.

AB Recent attention has focused on the foraging and food-provisioning strategies that allow procellariiform seabirds (e.g. albatrosses and shearwaters) to exploit pelagic food resources whilst providing food for dependent offspring at the nest. Several studies have found sexual differences in foraging and provisioning strategies in sexually dimorphic procellariiforms. However, there are few such data for species such as Manx shearwaters, that have negligible sexual size dimorphism. We used radiotracking coupled with periodic weighing of chicks to examine foraging trip durations and overall contributions to food provisioning by individual male and female Manx shearwaters at Skomer Island, U.K. Both sexes made trips of 1-4 days but females also made longer trips of up to 7 days. As a result, mean trip duration was significantly longer in females (2.1 days) than in males (1.5 days). Males fed their chick on a greater proportion of nights, delivered food to chicks at a higher rate, and made a greater contribution to overall food provisioning than females. Meal size increased with foraging trip duration but the yield to the chick in g/day was greater after short trips. Trips of 5-7 days would give females access to the highly productive nursery grounds for sardines, Sardina pilchardus, in the southeast Bay of Biscay, which were previously thought to be exploited by birds from Skomer but were more recently thought to be beyond the foraging range of chick-rearing adults, based on a mean trip duration of 2 days.

   TEMPERATURE; SELECTION; EVOLUTION; CONSEQUENCES; PATTERNS; PREDICTS
AB Evolutionary thermal adaptation is increasingly being elucidated in a variety of systems. However, one of the most striking examples, temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in reptiles, has proven stubbornly difficult to decipher. Theoretical models suggest that selection on and heritable variation in thermal sensitivity of embryonic sex determination and maternal behavioural choice of thermal qualities of nest sites control the microevolutionary potential of TSD. To begin addressing this important issue, we conducted a multiyear field study of nesting behaviour in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), which display TSD. We detected a significant field repeatability for overstory vegetation cover around nests at oviposition, a trait that is correlated inversely with nest temperature during embryonic sex determination and positively with offspring sex ratio (percentage of male). Neither clustered nesting nor individual spatial repeatability in nest site choice caused this striking pattern. Instead, females consistently preferred nest environments with particular quantities of overstory vegetation cover. These findings confirm a crucial assumption of models concerning the microevolution and adaptive significance of TSD in reptiles. The results also indicate that this system may be able to evolve via long-term maternal nesting behaviour in response to skewed sex ratios caused by environmental perturbations, such as gradual long-term climate change.

AB Although snow petrels, Pagodroma nivea, show a tendency to assortative mating by size morph, the existence of mixed pairs producing viable young reveals that reproductive isolation between the two size morphs is imperfect. However, the degree of isolation depends on breeding locality. A given area can harbour either (1) only small birds, or (2) only large birds, or (3) small bird colonies close to large bird ones, or (4) mixed pairs, the percentage of which varies from one locality to another. We investigated the mating and nesting patterns that result in mixed pairings and can explain the speciation process considered to be in progress by modern authors. Data from a 34-year demographic study in Terre Adelie, Antarctica, showed that mate and nest fidelity were very high. Nest changes, but not divorces, generally led to higher fecundity. Snow petrels did not seem to choose their mates on the basis of age or experience, and divorcees tended to form new pair bonds with neighbours; nevertheless, there was evidence for active mate fidelity. Pairs involving mates of the same size morph and mixed pairs had similar fecundity. Despite its heterogeneity, the breeding habitat of snow petrels was relatively predictable. Ice repeatedly made some nests unsuitable for breeding. Obtaining a nest that was not frozen was therefore the primary requirement for breeding. Strong competition for nests may explain high fidelity rates and, combined with the absence of reproductive costs in mixed pairs, may have promoted decreased choosiness during mate choice, preventing total reproductive isolation between the two morphs.

AB The notion that females prefer to visit and mate with grouped over solitary males is an oft-advanced hypothesis for the evolution of lek behaviour. A corollary of this hypothesis is that per capita mating success of males increases with increasing lek size. Few field studies have tested this prediction via experimental manipulation of lek size. Here, I describe field studies that monitored female visits to artificially created leks of varying size in two species of tephritid fruit flies, the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, and the Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis. No support for the female preference hypothesis was detected for B. dorsalis. However, in C. capitata, mean ratios of female sightings:signalling males were significantly greater for leks containing 18 or 36 males than leks that contained only six males. The observation that C. capitata males in natural populations typically form small leks suggests that a female-male conflict exists regarding optimal lek size.

AB Ravens, Corvus corax, yell when they approach rich but defended food sources. As in other species, such food-associated calls attract conspecifics. These calls may provide information about the sender, such as its behaviour or motivation, and about the type of stimuli to which the caller is responding, such as the location, quality or quantity of a food source. We investigated whether yells convey information about different types and amounts of food. We experimentally exposed a group of free-ranging ravens foraging in a game park near Grunau, Austria to six feeding situations. Food of one of three types (meat, kitchen leftovers, wild boar chow) and either of two quantities (one or three buckets) was shown to the ravens 10 min before they could gain access to it during the feeding of wild boars, Sus scrofa. Ravens responded to the sight of food with one type of yell, the long haa call. Haa calling rates varied with the type but not with the amount of food, and decreased during feeding. Although juveniles produced long yells (chii calls) in response to food they changed the context of calling with increasing independence from their parents. Ravens gave short 'who' yells when approaching the food. Who calling was thus not affected by the sight of food but by the feeding situation in general. This is comparable to other calls given in a foraging context, such as appeasement and intimidation calls. The different use of long and short yells relative to food availability suggests that who calls provide information about the caller, such as its behaviour at food, whereas haa calls may also provide information about the food itself. Our data are consistent with the idea that haa calls are functionally referential. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID HYBRIDIZATION; EVOLUTION; COMPLEX; CALLS; ANURA; SONG
AB Vocal communication is important for species recognition in colonial breeding species such as fur seals, especially where closely related species that can hybridize breed sympatrically. This is the first study to describe the calls of hybrid fur seals. We investigated whether these vocalizations are intermediate to those of their parental species (Antarctic, Arctocephalus gazella, subantarctic, A. tropicalis, and New Zealand, A. forsteri) and discuss the evolutionary implications of hybrids having intermediate vocal traits. Hybrid males' bark calls were intermediate between two distinct groups formed by A. tropicalis and A. gazella/A. forsteri. Patterns of intermediate call characteristics were also discernible for pup attraction calls (given by females) but not for full threat calls (given by males), nor female attraction calls (given by pups); however, for all call types hybrid calls were distinct from those of their parental species. The pattern of hybrid calls being intermediate is consistent with the expectation that call traits are genetically inherited. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study Animal Behaviour.

ID SONGBIRDS; BIRDS
AB Song intensity has been neglected in studies on the song development of oscine birds. We analysed this ontogenetic trajectory in the singing of hand-reared nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos, from their earliest song vocalizations (subsong) through plastic singing, to their adult full song. Embedded in an age-dependent increase in overall sound level, nightingales showed systematic amplitude differences within their song performances. Episodes of song performance containing many imitations of acquired model songs (IPA phases) were produced with a higher amplitude than episodes with only few or no imitations (UPA phases). Further analysis of song patterns revealed that this difference was mainly due to the high number of imitations occurring during the IPA phases. However, unidentified patterns (UPA) that were vocalized during IPA phases had a significantly higher vocal amplitude than UPAs vocalized during UPA phases. This finding indicates that, besides pattern-related amplitude differences, performance phases as a whole also differed in amplitude. The consistent pattern- and phase-related differences in sound level indicate that the control of vocal amplitude should be viewed as an integrative part of the vocal learning process.

AB The pupal parasitoid Pimpla (=Coccygomimus) turionellae L. (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) attacks a broad range of lepidopteran pupae. The variation in host size translates into substantial differences in size among adult parasitoids. Pimpla turionellae shows a strong host size-dependent sex allocation, which indicates that parasitoid body size influences sex-specific effects on fitness costs. We tested whether the body size of females affects their capacity to locate hosts by vibrational sounding. We investigated parasitoids from three size categories with respect to their ability to find artificial hosts (cigarette filters) in cylinders made of thin or thick paper (20 or 65 g/m(2), respectively). Using laser Doppler vibrometry, we measured vibration signals produced by large and medium-sized females during vibrational sounding. Large females produced vibrations of a higher intensity than, but a similar frequency to, their smaller conspecifics. The parasitoid's ability to locate a hidden host model by vibrational sounding also improved with size. This indicates that parasitoid size is an important factor in determining the female's host-searching success. We discuss the results in relation to the parasitoid's behavioural ecology.

AB The oviposition decisions made by insect parasitoids when encountering hosts of variable quality have been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental investigation. For parasitoids that lay their eggs inside the host, the possible outcomes of encounters with parasitized hosts have been assumed to include only oviposition (superparasitism), rejection, or in some cases feeding on host haemolymph. We document another outcome in Encarsia formosa Gahan (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), a species that has been a model system for the study of oviposition behaviour. In E. formosa, females may kill eggs previously laid within the host by jabbing them with their ovipositor before ovipositing themselves. (1) Our observations indicated that jabbed eggs were indeed killed. (2) In experimental arenas in the laboratory, ovicide occurred in the majority of encounters with parasitized hosts and at highest frequency in encounters resulting in oviposition. (3) There was no significant difference in the handling time associated with oviposition+ovicide in parasitized hosts in comparison with oviposition alone, suggesting that there is no time cost to ovicide. (4) Ovicide did not appear to be incidental to normal probing within a host. Radial analysis of the direction of ovipositor movement with respect to the centre of the previously laid egg within the host showed that females engaged in ovicidal bouts probed most often in the direction of the egg. This is the first well-documented study of ovicide in an endoparasitoid. We suggest ovicide may be under-reported in other endoparasitoid species due to the difficulty of observing it.

AB Palatability of plant foods may change over time in relation to the concentration of toxic secondary metabolites. We investigated the behavioural response of capuchin monkeys to this type of change and assessed the influence of social conditions. Twenty-seven tufted capuchin monkeys were presented in Social or Individual conditions with a familiar palatable food (phase 1), with the same familiar food to which pepper had been added, making it unpalatable (phase 2), and with the same familiar palatable food of phase 1 (phase 3). Five sessions were carried out in each phase. The capuchins adapted quickly to the change in food palatability by reducing (phase 2) and increasing (phase 3) the amounts of food eaten. The unpalatable food prompted an increase in olfactory exploration and in food processing. The experimental conditions (Social versus Individual) did not influence consumption, or any of the other behaviours. In addition, capuchins were more often near subjects with food in phases 2 and 3 in which palatability changed than in phase 1. These findings show that capuchins readily adjust to changes in flavour and palatability of a familiar food and that sudden unpalatability has no carry-over effects. Therefore, capuchins behave differently towards a familiar food whose palatability has changed than they do towards novel foods. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Glowlight tetras, Hemigrammus erythrozonus, show a conspicuous visual display ('fin flicking') upon detecting a conspecific chemical alarm signal (alarm pheromone). We conducted laboratory studies to test two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses regarding the function of this behaviour. To test the hypothesis that fin flicking acts as a visual alarm signal to conspecifics, we paired shoals of tetras with a stimulus tetra in an adjacent tank (separated by a one-way mirror) and exposed the stimulus tetras to conspecific skin extract (with alarm pheromone) or swordtail skin extract (which lacks ostariophysan alarm pheromone). Stimulus tetras significantly increased their frequency of fin flicking when exposed to conspecific skin extract, but not to the swordtail skin extract control. The test shoals showed a significant increase in antipredator behaviour in response to fin-flicking stimulus tetras, but not to stimulus tetras that did not fin-flick. To test the hypothesis that fin flicking serves as a predator deterrent, we paired predatory Jack Dempsey cichlids, Cichlasoma octofaciatum, with tetras in adjacent tanks and exposed the tetras to either conspecific or swordtail skin extract. Predators remained further away from the stimulus tetra, took longer to initiate a bite and displayed fewer bites towards tetras that fin-flicked compared with tetras that did not fin-flick. These results support our hypothesis that fin flicking in tetras serves as both a visual alarm signal to conspecifics and a deterring signal to predators, and suggest that individual tetras may reduce their risk of predation by fin flicking upon detecting a predation threat.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID SPATIAL MEMORY; SITES
AB Clark's nutcrackers regularly store large numbers of pine seeds and remember the locations of the cached seeds. Although they are very accurate, they do make same errors during recovery. In an attempt to determine whether any behaviours during caching predicted the occurrence of errors during recovery, we videotaped Clark's nutcrackers while they cached and recovered seeds under laboratory conditions. We used the videotapes to develop complete, quantitative descriptions of caching and recovery behaviour, with an emphasis on body orientation and directions of movement. During caching, the birds showed the greatest change in their orientation and direction following cache creation. During cache recovery, in contrast, body orientation changed most following successful recovery of a seed. When orientation while making a cache was compared with orientation when recovering the same cache, orientations were similar more often than would be expected by chance. However, this consistency of direction was not related to the accuracy of cache recovery, indicating that such consistency is not necessary for accurate cache recovery. The location in which the birds chose to place their caches was the only variable that predicted the location of probes during recovery. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Signal design and meaning are dependent on the condition of the sender and receiver as well as the response of the receiver. This study examined (1) whether female Asian elephants, Elephas maximus, can distinguish between a conspecific male in musth and nonmusth states using urinary signals, (2) how the oestrous condition of the female affects discrimination, and (3) correlation of female responses with the testosterone level of the male. Musth is a rut-like state displayed by healthy adult male elephants. Males in musth dominate nonmusth males and may be preferred by females as mates. Urine was collected from two captive male Asian elephants during nonmusth periods and from one or these males during times of musth. Samples of musth and nonmusth urine and control liquids were placed in an elephant enclosure weekly for 16 weeks, the length of a female oestrous cycle. Primary response behaviours were approach and four trunk-tip motions, namely sniff, check, place and flehmen. Musth urine consistently elicited greater responses than nonmusth and control samples. Females were more responsive during their follicular (sexually receptive) than luteal (unreceptive) stages of oestrus. Furthermore, females appeared to be sensitive to the degree of musth as responses increased with rising serum;testosterone levels of the male donor. Chemical signals from males are a likely source of honest signals related to status and reproductive condition. Female elephants appear capable of detecting differences in a male based upon urinary chemosignals. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID WHITE-TAILED DEER; CAPREOLUS-CAPREOLUS; BEHAVIOR; ALARM; VOCALIZATIONS;
   POPULATIONS
AB We studied the barking behaviour of free-ranging roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, in response to disturbance provoked by a human observer and in response to the playback of recorded barks. Three alternative functions of this behaviour were hypothesized: barking is an alarm call, a pursuit-deterrent call or a territorial call. Our observational data showed that, in the presence of a source of disturbance, solitary individuals barked more frequently than deer in groups, suggesting that barking does not serve to warn conspecifics of potential danger, but rather to inform any potential predator that it has been identified. The frequencies of both barking and counterbarking (barking of a second deer in response to the barks of an initiator) were inversely correlated with ambient luminosity, probably because the assessment of danger is more difficult when visibility is low. Males barked more frequently than females when disturbed. Moreover, when we played back a series of barks from within a buck's territory, this provoked counterbarking or aggressive behaviours rather than flight. Older bucks responded more frequently to playbacks than younger bucks. We suggest that while barking may initially have evolved as a signal to deter predator pursuit, it could play an important, secondary role in the territorial system of this species.

AB Homo sapiens is increasingly being studied within the evolutionary (adaptationist, selectionist) framework favoured by animal behaviour researchers. There are various labels for such work, including evolutionary psychology, human behavioural ecology and human sociobiology. Collectively, we call these areas 'human evolutionary psychology' (HEP) because their shared objective is an evolutionary understanding of human information processing and decision making. Sexual selection and sex differences have been especially prominent in recent HEP research, but many other topics have been addressed, including parent-offspring relations, reciprocity and exploitation, foraging strategies and spatial cognition. Many HEP researchers began their scientific careers in animal behaviour, and in many ways, HEP research is scarcely distinguishable from other animal behaviour research. Currently controversial issues in HEP, such as the explanation(s) for observed levels of heritable diversity, the kinds of data needed to test adaptationist hypotheses, and the characterization of a species-typical 'environment of evolutionary adaptedness', are issues in animal behaviour as well. What gives HEP a distinct methodological flavour is that the research animal can talk, an ability that has both advantages and pitfalls for researchers. The proper use of self-reports and other verbal data in HEP might usefully become a subject of future research in its own right. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In any problem-solving situation, there are features associated with the problem that are relevant from a functional perspective and other features that are irrelevant. To determine whether animals are sensitive to the distinction between functionally relevant and irrelvant features of a problem, we conducted two main experiments with a New World monkey, the cotton-top tamarin. In the first condition of both experiments, subjects were required to pull a piece of cloth to gain access to a piece of food. The first experiment involved choosing between food that was on the cloth and food that was off the cloth. The second experiment involved choosing between food that was on a connected piece of cloth and food that was on two pieces of cloth separated by a horizontal gap. Having learned to solve either of these two problems, we conducted a series of probe conditions to determine whether the tamarins would generalize to changes in the shape, size, colour, and texture of the cloth and food, the position of the food relative to the cloth, and the type of,connection between two pieces of cloth. For most of the probe conditions, the tamarins readily generalized, showing no decrement in performance, even on the first trial. For other conditions, involving apparently more subtle discrimination (e.g, a narrow vertical gap between the two pieces of cloth), explicit training was required. These results indicate that tamarins solve means-end relationships, and that their ability depends on a discrimination between properties that are functionally relevant as opposed to irrelevant.

AB Sex differences in immune function are well established among laboratory rodents, with males typically having lower immunity than females. This sex difference may reflect the suppressive effects of testosterone on immune function. Because polygynous males generally have higher circulating testosterone concentrations than monogamous males, sex differences in immune function are hypothesized to be more pronounced among polygynous as compared to monogamous species. Sex differences in immune function have not been consistently observed among individually housed Microtus in the laboratory; thus, social interactions are hypothesized to be necessary for the expression of sex differences in immune function. We assessed the effect of differential housing conditions on humoral immunity and steroid hormone concentrations in polygynous meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, and monogamous prairie voles, M. ochrogaster. We examined humoral immunity by immunizing voles with keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) and measuring antibody production 5, 10, 15 and 30 days postimmunization. Overall, meadow voles mounted higher anti-KLH immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG responses than prairie voles, regardless of the housing condition. Sex differences in antibody production were only observed among meadow voles housed in pairs, in which females had higher anti-KLH IgM and IgG responses than males. Sex differences in antibody production were not observed among prairie voles or meadow voles housed individually. Sex and species differences in circulating oestradiol, testosterone, and corticosterone concentrations were not related to differences in humoral immunity. These data suggest that sex differences in immune function are more pronounced among polygynous species than monogamous species, but may be context dependent.

AB Environmental demands that require intensive search for mates, food and nest sites are correlated with efficient spatial memory in many mammalian and avian species. This convergence of evidence has led to the view that spatial memory, and the neurological structures associated with it, have been selected in niches that require memory for the location,of goal objects. Whether such evolutionary demands are also correlated with nonspatial abilities that require flexible use of associations similar to those required for spatial memory has not been well studied. In addition, correlations between niche types and the use of spatial or nonspatial memory have not been investigated in nonmammalian, nonavian taxa. In this study, we investigated the relationship between foraging strategies and performance on two; tasks, one spatial and the other nonspatial, in congeneric lizard species: Acanthodactylus boskianus, an active forager that collects clumped sedentary prey, and Acanthodactylus scutellatus, a sit-and-wait predator that collects distributed mobile prey. The two species did not differ in their performance of a spatial memory task, but A. boskianus, the active forager, performed better on the reversal of a visual discrimination, a nonspatial task. These findings question the generality of the spatial adaptation model for vertebrates. We present the pliancy hypothesis, which we developed to account for these results.

ID ORB-WEB; BEHAVIOR; FEATURES; GEOMETRY
AB The garden cross orb-spider, Araneus diadematus, shows behavioural responses to leg loss and regeneration that are reflected in the geometry of the web's capture spiral. We created a virtual spider robot that mimicked the web construction behaviour of thus handicapped real spiders. We used this approach to test the correctness and consistency of hypotheses about orb web construction. The behaviour of our virtual robot was implemented in a rule-based system supervising behaviour patterns that communicated with the robot's sensors and motors. By building the typical web of a nonhandicapped spider our first model failed and led to new observations on real spiders. We realized that in addition to leg position, leg posture could also be of importance. The implementation of this new hypothesis greatly improved the results of our simulation of a handicapped spider. Now simulated webs, like the real webs of handicapped spiders, had significantly more gaps in successive spiral turns compared with webs of nonhandicapped spiders. Moreover, webs built by the improved virtual spiders intercepted prey as well as the digitized real webs. However, the main factors that affected web interception frequency were prey size, size of capture area and individual variance; having a regenerated leg, surprisingly, was relatively unimportant for this trait.

ID BEHAVIOR; TRANSMISSION
AB Opportunities for social learning within a group of animals are likely to be influenced by the social dynamics of that group. Some individuals may be more influential demonstrators than others even when there are no differences in their skill level or performance. In this study of domestic hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, differences in demonstrator salience were examined. From 24 separate flocks we selected as demonstrators a dominant cockerel, a dominant hen, a mid-ranking hen or a subordinate hen. Demonstrators were pretrained to perform an operant discrimination task to obtain food. Six observers from each flock individually watched the demonstrator perform the task for four 5-min sessions held on consecutive days. On the fifth day observers were tested individually in the operant chamber. We analysed data from 19 flocks, where there were no quantitative differences in demonstrator performance. Observer hens of relatively high social status performed more correct operant pecks than observer hens of relatively low social status. Demonstrator category also had a significant effect on subsequent observer behaviour. Hens that had observed cockerels performed very few general pecks or operant pecks. Hens that had observed dominant hens performed more operant pecks, but hens that had observed subordinate hens performed more general pecks in the chamber. The results suggested either that there was an interaction between dominance and gender in demonstrator salience or that dominant hens might have been influential because of some factor imperfectly associated with their dominance status. A possible candidate was the foraging ability of the dominant hens. In a second experiment using the same protocol, we manipulated the prior foraging success of dominant hens from four additional flocks but this had no significant effect on their subsequent influence as demonstrators.

AB From 1987 to 1994, the annual frequency of adoption by breeding pairs at a Lake Erie ring-billed gull, Larus delawarensis, colony ranged from 3 to 37% (average 8%/year, N=7 years) and, on average, foster parents raised 0.5 fewer of their own chicks to fledging than pairs that did not adopt. The key evolutionary question is: why do some individuals apparently suffer the costs associated with a behaviour that appears to enhance the fitness of others? From 1992 to 1995, I investigated the proximate and ultimate causes of adoption in ring-billed gulls from the perspectives of both the foster parents and adopted chicks, and tested predictions that differentiated between various competing adaptive and nonadaptive hypotheses that have been proposed to explain it. While I was able to demonstrate a breeding cost, I failed to identify any benefits to foster parents. Thus, the adaptive hypotheses that rely on the foster parents benefiting were not supported (e.g. kin selection, reciprocal altruism, acquisition of parenting experience). From the foster parent's perspective, adoption was mediated through errors in parent-offspring recognition. Under natural conditions, most fostering pairs were tending small chicks (<6 days old) at the time of adoptions; in chick-transfer experiments, resident parents did not discriminate against foreign chicks until their own chicks were 7-9 days old. Chicks (N=25) that subsequently abandoned their natal nests were lighter, and grew at a slower rate, than chicks that survived to fledging in their home broods. Thus, departing chicks were at a survival disadvantage in their home broods. Chicks that gained acceptance into foreign broods where they were older/larger than the resident chicks realized high survival at the expense of their foster siblings and parents. Based upon individual growth rates and the corresponding survival probabilities, disadvantaged chicks approximately doubled their survival chances through foster care. Why has selection not eliminated adoption? I argue that adoption is an evolutionary arms race between the two principle actor groups; disadvantaged chicks, which benefit through foster care, and host parents, which avoid providing foster care (e.g. infanticide). In ring-billed gulls, selection has failed to eliminate adoption because the long-term reproductive cost (estimated at 4%, this study) of an occasional adoption is probably offset by the relatively higher costs associated with stricter kin discrimination mechanisms (e.g. parental infanticide).

AB In this study, I tested whether the courtship behaviours that facilitate patterns of assortative pairing and mating could be culturally transmitted across generations of brown-headed cowbirds. In an earlier study, I housed a first generation of young South Dakota cowbirds in one of two cultural backgrounds: (1) with adult social models from the;same population; or, (2) with adult social models from a behaviourally distinct Indiana population. During the breeding season, the first cultural generation of South Dakota cowbirds paired and mated assortatively based upon their cultural backgrounds. In the present study, I tested whether these courtship patterns could be culturally transmitted to a second generation of young South Dakota cowbirds. Serving as adult social models for birds of the second cultural generation were the first cultural generation of South Dakota birds from the previous study. During their first breeding season, the birds of the second cultural generation paired assortatively by cultural background at roughly a 3:1 ratio. In addition to the pairing data, the behavioural responses of females to the vocalizations of males indicated the influence of cultural backgrounds. This experimental demonstration of the cultural transmission of courtship patterns points to the importance of social environments as mechanisms whereby behavioural systems are inherited from one generation of animals to the next.

AB Procellariiformes are well known for their low rates of food provisioning to their slow-growing chicks. In some species, the patterns of food delivery to chicks have been deduced from changes in their weight, obtained from periodic weighings. However, the behaviour of individual parents cannot be resolved using this method. In this study, we used a periodic weighing protocol with Gory's shearwater chicks on Selvagem Grande island, in the northeast Atlantic. In addition, we used an automatic logging system to examine the attendance of individual parents. In 1997, the chicks were fed infrequently, and were in significantly poorer condition, than in other years and at other colonies. This suggests that the adults were experiencing some difficulties in finding an adequate food supply close to the colony. Under these conditions, individual parents adopted a dual provisioning strategy, making both short and long foraging trips, a previously undescribed behaviour in any northern hemisphere petrel species. Although meals delivered to chicks were larger after long trips than after short trips, the average amount of food provisioned per day spent at sea decreased with increasing trip length, and so chicks did not benefit from longer trips. This finding suggests;that long trips can be used to restore the adult's body condition, presumably depleted during short trips as shown previously for some petrels and albatrosses. The adoption of this flexible foraging strategy, which differs from the uniform intervals observed in Gory's shearwaters experiencing situations of 'normal' food abundance, may represent a mechanism through which breeding birds compromise between the needs of their chicks and the maintenance of their own body condition.

AB In insects and spiders, the pattern of sperm priority is often attributed to the shape of the spermathecae and should entail marked consequences for mating behaviour. Since last-male priority is assumed to occur in haplogyne spiders such as the cellar spider, females of this species are predicted to be more attractive to males shortly before, than shortly after, egg laying and males may guard females after copulation until oviposition. To test these predictions, I individually marked spiders of a natural population and recorded their position and the distance between potential mating partners twice a day over 100 days. The distance between female and male was taken as a measure of the female's attractiveness. The behaviour of cellar spider males was not in accordance with the predictions; females were visited throughout the observation period with no significant increase in attractiveness before egg laying and there was no evidence for mate guarding. However, female attractiveness was correlated with female size, which was correlated with the number of eggs laid. Behaviour and genital morphology suggest sperm mixing occurs in this species. This is discussed in the light of conflicting data on sperm priority. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We developed a technique that assists in objective identification of pulse and sine components in the Drosophila,melanogaster courtship song. The song was recorded digitally and subjected to wavelet analysis, which decomposed the signal into a series of bands of decreasing frequency in which acoustic power appeared as a function of time. This time-frequency analysis expresses characteristic 'fingerprints' of the pulses, which appear in all frequency bands, and characteristic 'fingerprints' of the sine song, which appear only in the band containing its frequency. Means of the interpulse intervals (IPIs) for each second of 10-min recordings of song in which pulse singing occurred constituted an irregularly sampled time series, intractable to common spectral analysis techniques. Therefore, we took the discrete Fourier transform of this series, which retained all the spectral information in the Fourier coefficients, and used the inverse Fourier transform of these coefficients to yield a new series that was regularly spaced, with an estimate of IPI for each second in the interval. We observed an IPI period of 67.9 s in wild type, 31.1 s in per(O), 45.9 s in per(s), and 72.0 s in per(L). (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Richardson's ground squirrels, Spermophilus richardsonii, issue vocal alarm responses to avian and terrestrial predators. Recipients of those calls presumably benefit from enhanced detection and subsequent avoidance of predators. If receivers of alarm calls differentiate among callers, they could use that information to tailor their behavioural response to the perceived level of threat. A neighbour's call may indicate more imminent danger than that of a non-neighbour; with individual recognition, recipients could adjust their response according to the reliability of the caller. I elicited and recorded alarm calls of juvenile Richardson's ground squirrels using an avian predator model. Series of five calls were then played back to focal juveniles in the field. Within each series, playbacks involved an initial 'habituation series' of four calls of either a neighbour or a non-neighbour. In 'control' series, the fifth call was from the same individual but differed from the four preceding it. In 'experimental' series, the fifth call was from a different individual than those played earlier. Juveniles showed greater vigilance in response to playbacks of neighbours' calls relative to non-neighbours' calls, but habituated rapidly to call playbacks, showing a significant decline in vigilance by the second call. In control series, a different call from the same individual did not significantly increase vigilance. In experimental series, a call from a different individual restored vigilance to a level similar to that recorded prior to habituation. These results suggest that juvenile Richardson's ground squirrels discriminate among callers and use that ability to respond differentially to alarm calls issued by neighbours and non-neighbours.

AB The question of whether, and how, male birds should change their parental effort in response to reduced paternity is a controversial issue among behavioural ecologists. We report a study on pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, in which paternity was manipulated through experimentally induced mate switching during the female's fertile period. The paternity of care-giving males ranged from 0 to 100% of the brood, The number of parental males per nest varied between zero and two, and the amount of male assistance in nestling provisioning had a marked effect on female reproductive success. For 17 monogamous males, provisioning effort and the body mass of nestlings on day 12 were reduced at low levels of paternity. However, the shape of the effort function was not unambiguously determined. Male provisioning effort showed a curvilinear decline, whereas nestling body mass showed a linear decline. Two important assumptions of the theory of optimal parental effort seem to be fulfilled in this case: that males had reliable cues to their paternity, and that paternity is likely to be increased in future (normal) breeding attempts. The fact that males reduced their effort at the expense of the welfare of the offspring suggests that there are significant costs of parental care in this species. Whether a similar response to cuckoldry occurs in unmanipulated breeding situations remains to be studied. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID ALLONEMOBIUS-FASCIATUS; BODY SIZE; MICE
AB Maternal effects on offspring phenotype are well known in organisms inhabiting seasonal environments. Mothers that perceive climatological changes indicative of winter's onset will often produce increasing numbers of offspring that enter a state of arrested morphogenesis known as 'diapause'. In this study of bivoltine Allonemobius socius ground crickets, we manipulated the abiotic environment experienced by ovipositing females (i.e. maternal-oviposition environment) and that experienced by offspring incubating as eggs (i.e. egg-incubation environment) to assess the degree to which mothers contribute to the expression of embryonic diapause in her offspring. Analysis of variance components indicated that variation in maternal-oviposition environment contributed only about 4% to the total variation in diapause incidence, compared to about 24% from embryos responding directly to variation in their incubation environment. Moreover, the 8% contribution from between-family variation was significant, suggesting that parental genes and maternal biotic and abiotic environments contribute to diapause expression in offspring. Although these findings suggest that maternal physiology itself contributes little to embryonic diapause variation in A. socius, they do not preclude other maternal behaviours (e.g. placement of eggs at different soil depths) that may affect offspring diapause.

Males have red plumage, and females have tan plumage with limited areas of red feathering. Cardinals were used to address the two models and determine whether plumage brightness signals level of parental care by both sexes. Absolute effort in feeding nestlings by males was not correlated with male breast plumage colour, but effort by females was positively correlated with female underwing plumage colour. Absolute feeding effort by females was also inversely related to brightness of the mate's breast colour. As a consequence, the proportion of a pair's total feedings provided by the male was positively correlated with male breast colour. Proportion of total feedings provided by the female was positively correlated with female wing colour. Feeding efforts (both per nest and per nestling) were correlated between mates, but birds did not mate assortatively in relation to colour. These results support the good parent hypothesis, suggesting colour brightness is a signal of parental care. The results also indicate that ornamentation of both members of the pair may be important determinants of relative efforts in provisioning nestlings by parent birds.

TI Influence of comfort and social stimuli on a comfort movement and a

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB We tested the extent of emancipation of the Whistle-shake display of male shelducks, Tadorna tadorna, from causal factors controlling its presumed evolutionary precursor, the Body-shake, a comfort movement. Both motor patterns show similarities in form and alternate in a yearly rhythm. First, in an artificial rain experiment, we analysed the influence of a stimulus controlling comfort movements. In spring almost exclusively Whistle-shakes were induced even in the absence of social stimuli, while in summer the birds performed predominantly Body-shakes. This is probably related to the seasonal production of sex hormones. Second, we tested the influence of social stimuli by confronting shelducks with displaying and non-displaying males. During moult when males almost exclusively perform Body-shakes we found no influence of social stimulation on the frequency or form of shakes. However, an effect of social stimulation was found in a period when the drakes gradually replace the Body-shake by the Whistle-shake which is after moult in autumn. In this experiment, birds were confronted with either an empty cage (control), artificial rain, a non-displaying or a displaying male conspecific. In relation to the control situation the birds performed more Whistle-shakes when stimulated socially and more Body-shakes when stimulated with artificial rain. The extent to which both shaking patterns share the same causal factors is discussed. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Mercury vapour lamps interfere with the bat defence of tympanate moths
   (Operophtera spp.; Geometridae)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Bats often forage near streetlamps, where they catch moths in particular. At least two hypotheses may explain the apparent increase in the availability of moths to bats feeding around streetlamps: (1) the moths become concentrated near the light and therefore more profitable to exploit; and (2) the light interferes with the moths' evasive flight behaviour. We tested the second of these hypotheses by exposing flying male winter moths, Operophtera spp., to bursts of ultrasound (26 kHz, 110 dB sound pressure level) from an electronic source. The light from a 125 W mercury vapour lamp had a quantitative effect on the moths' evasive flight response at close range (within ca 4 m), inhibiting it totally in nearly half (43%, N=125) of the cases. By contrast, moths flying in the surrounding woodland and without interference from the lamp always responded to the sound. Streetlamps of the mercury vapour type (white lamps) thus interfere with the defensive behaviour of moths and presumably increase their vulnerability to echolocating bats. This may have implications for the conservation of both moths and bats. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Queens from three colonies of feral honey bees, Apis mellifera, were removed and placed in separate nucleus colonies. For each colony, eggs and larvae were taken from the nucleus and placed in the main hive on each of 3-4 consecutive weeks. Workers in the queenless parts selected young larvae to rear as queens. Queen pupae, together with the surrounding worker pupae, were removed from each colony and analysed at two to three microsatellite loci to determine their paternity. In all three colonies, the paternity of larvae chosen by the bees to rear as queens was not a random sample of the paternities in the worker brood, with certain subfamilies being over-represented in queens. These results support an important prediction of kin selection theory: when colonies are queenless, unequal relatedness within colonies could lead to the evolution of reproductive competition, that is some subfamilies achieving greater reproductive success than others. The mechanism by which such dominance is achieved could be through a system of kin recognition and nepotism, but we conclude that genetically based differential attractiveness of larvae for rearing as queens is more likely.

AB We measured whether males of five species of poeciliid fish made detours to the right or left of a vertical-bar obstacle in order to approach a group of females. Three of these species, Gambusia holbrooki, Gambusia nicaraguensis and Poecilia reticulata showed a significant bias to the left, whereas Brachyrhaphis roseni and Girardinus falcatus showed a significant bias to the right. When tested for direction of turning in front of an opaque barrier, or when a dummy predator was used as a target in a detour test, G. holbrooki and G. falcatus showed similar biases to the right (opaque barrier) and left (predator), thus suggesting that the difference observed when females were used as a target could arise from species differences in the degree of sexual motivation in a novel environment. The two species that showed bias to the right with the females were less likely to exhibit sexual behaviour when placed in a novel environment. Moreover, manipulation of the factors affecting the relative strength of sexual motivation and of fear of a novel environment, such as how long fish were maintained in captivity or in the test apparatus before being tested, caused shifts in the direction of the lateral asymmetries. These results suggest that the presence of functional asymmetries in behaviour could be widespread among vertebrates and that the direction of such asymmetries tends to be strikingly similar in closely related species, thus supporting the hypothesis of an; early evolution of laterality in brain and behaviour.

TI Patch departure decisions by spice finches foraging singly or in groups
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID PUBLIC INFORMATION; COMPETITION; STARLINGS; HABITATS; RISK
AB The marginal value theorem predicts that when resources are clumped in space, a forager can maximize its rate of intake by deciding to leave a patch when its current feeding rate falls below the average for the habitat. A group version of the model predicts that when rate-maximizing group members share a patch, they should leave sooner, and each with less gain, than single animals exploiting the same patch. We tested these predictions in the laboratory by measuring patch departure decisions of spice finches, Lonchura punctulata, exploiting food patches alone or in groups of three under two habitats that require different travel times. As predicted, group members left the patch sooner and with fewer seeds than single foragers. Unlike the model's assumptions, however, birds did not share the patch equally, and their exploitation curves could not be simply derived from those of single foragers. Grouping decreased the effect of travel time on patch exploitation. Moreover, within each group the bird expected to leave first delayed its departure although it collected fewer seeds than the others. This delayed departure could aim to maintain group membership. We noted an increased variability in seed number collected by group members compared with single foragers, which could be a cost of group foraging.

AB Immigration patterns and the frequency of breeding dispersal in tree squirrels are predicted to be related to the amount of temporal and spatial variation in tree seed crops, their primary food supply. We studied Eurasian red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris, dispersal patterns in a stable habitat with predictable food supply and a variable habitat with large temporal and spatial variations in food availability. In both habitats, we observed a male-biased immigration in spring and a female-biased immigration in autumn. However, there were more adults among immigrating red squirrels in the variable (66%) than the stable (31%) habitat and large differences in the extent of site fidelity between the two squirrel populations. Multivariate analyses indicate that food availability appeared to be the main factor affecting female dispersal behaviour. The data also suggest that female red squirrel dispersal patterns are an adaptive response to the predictability of food resources in space and time. Male dispersal behaviour seemed to be influenced by the distribution of the females. Their level of site fidelity was high in the stable habitat, whereas they appeared to track the movement of females in the variable habitat.

AB Male western bluebirds, Sialia mexicana, show patterns of mate following consistent with mate guarding. The hypothesis that males prevent extra-pair copulations by guarding their mates was tested using I-h male detention experiments. Males were caged on territory in view of the female, visually occluded on territory or removed from the territory altogether (visually+vocally occluded). Extra-pair males were more likely to join females within 15 m and attempt to copulate with them in the three detention treatments than in treatments where males were captured and released or not manipulated at all. Detention also increased the number of females accepting one or more extra-pair copulations. The increased frequency of extra-pair copulations was not caused by movement of females away from their nests, nor by increased rates of vocalization by resident males or females. Extra-pair events occurred shortly after the resident male was caught, suggesting that extra-pair copulations can occur during brief lapses in mate following. Intruding males were usually neighbours with mates and nests of their own. Half intruded;when their own mates were at peak receptivity, suggesting that males leave their own fertile mates to seek extra-pair copulations. Detained males did not compensate for detention by increasing the frequency with which they copulated with their mates after they were returned to the territory. Acceptance of extra-pair copulations by females did not increase with;he number of extra-pair copulation attempts and females were no more likely to participate in extra-pair copulations when resident males were visually occluded than when they were visually present. Only half of the females that experienced extra-pair copulation attempts accepted one or:more extra-pair copulations. Although male detention resulted in an increase in the frequency of extra-pair copulations in western bluebirds, females appeared to be selective about participating in extra-pair matings.

AB The links between ecology, behavioural plasticity and brain size are often tested via the comparative method. Given the problems in interpretating comparative tests of learning and cognition, however, alternative measures of plasticity need to be developed. From the short notes section of nine ornithological journals, two separate, exhaustive data sets have been collated on opportunistic foraging innovations in birds of North America (1973-1993; N=196) and the British Isles (1983-1993; N=126). Both the absolute and relative frequencies (corrected for species number per order) of innovations differ between bird orders in a similar fashion in the two geographical zones. Absolute and relative frequency of innovations per order are also related to two measures of relative forebrain size in the two zones. The study confirms predicted trends linking opportunism, brain size and rate of structural evolution. It also suggests that innovation rate in the held may be a useful measure of behavioural plasticity. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ability of naked mole-rats, Heterocephalus glaber, to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics and their response to intruders was investigated. Odour cues used by mole-rats in recognition contexts were identified in a three-way choice apparatus and 'decision rules' for accepting or rejecting conspecifics were explored in a series of odour manipulation experiments. Naked mole-rats were highly xenophobic, even to closely related foreign conspecifics, and a division of labour existed amongst the non-breeders in colony defence. The principal mechanism of recognition appeared to be distinct colony odour labels, contributed by each colony member and distributed among, and learned by, all colony members. Differences in the mixture of these odours may provide even genetically similar colonies with a unique odour label. These odours persisted despite controlling for exogenous cues. Fitness consequences of these phenomena are interpreted with respect to the need for closely related neighbouring colonies to maintain autonomy and the importance of excluding foreign competitors from within-colony rivalry for reproductive succession.

AB Play-partner preferences were investigated in 38 sable antelope calves observed in semi-captivity at the National Zoological Park's Conservation and Research Center near Front Royal, Virginia. All calves initiated play with peers but rarely played with yearlings or adults. Calves initiated play with most calves in their cohort but had strong preferences for one or two peers. Preferences were highly symmetrical and stable over time. Partners of similar age were preferred. Calves did not prefer individuals of the same sex, nor did they consistently favour individuals of one sex over the other. Calves initiated less play with related peers than expected by chance. Patterns of play-partner preference in infant sable antelope supported the concept of play as self assessment, whereby individuals continually compare their developmental competence with that of their peers.

   FERTILIZATIONS; PATERNITY; SWALLOWS; BIRDS
AB The western bluebird, Sialia mexicana, is a socially monogamous passerine with extra-pair offspring in over one-third of nests. Copulatory behaviour and mate attendance were observed for 5 years to determine whether males protect their paternity by mate guarding. Western bluebirds copulated frequently but the frequency of copulation did not increase in the hour after laying, when fertilization is thought to occur. Males attempted to copulate with their mates at a steady rate from 60 days before laying until the onset of incubation. Female acceptance of within-pair copulations increased to 80% 10 days before laying and remained high throughout the laying period. Proximity of paired males and females corresponded with changes in the frequency of within-pair copulation attempts, but following of females by their mates corresponded with peak receptivity of females to copulation. Neither proximity nor following corresponded with temporal changes in the rate of courtship feeding. Pairs were closer and following of the female more frequent when nearest neighbour distances were reduced, as expected with mate guarding if the threat of extra-pair copulation increases with local density. Pairs were also closer when vegetative cover around the nest increased, suggesting that one function of mate attendance may be to keep the female in view. Male western bluebirds may ensure their paternity by thwarting extra-pair copulations and by increasing copulatory access; however, paternity assurance provides a more comprehensive explanation than copulatory access for spatial and temporal variation in associative behaviours of pairs.

AB Aposematic prey tend to live gregariously. A recent study using artificial prey has shown that a gregarious life style can be advantageous by generating faster avoidance learning in predators (Gagliardo & Guilford 1993, Proc. R Soc. Lond. Ser. B, 286, 149-150). However. a predator may react differently to artificial and live prey. This study investigates whether chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, react differently towards aggregations and solitary individuals of the seed bug Spilostethus pandurus (Heteroptera: Lygaeidae). There was no significant difference in the speed of avoidance learning between chicks presented with grouped prey and chicks presented with solitary prey. The aggregated prey did, however, generate greater unconditioned aversion than prey presented singly. This indicates that a possible advantage of grouping in aposematic prey is a more effective aposematic signal. The greater unconditioned aversion is comparable to the generally greater initial reluctance of predators to attack aposematic than cryptic prey.

AB Willow tits, Parus montanus, spend the winter in flocks and hoard food especially in the autumn to be used later. For caching to be an evolutionarily stable strategy, the hoarder should be more likely to retrieve its caches than conspecifics. The effects of individual differences, the time of day and, especially, the presence of conspecifics and heterospecific birds on caching behaviour of free-living willow tits were examined with a legit model. The presence of conspecifics had the strongest influence on caching: if there were other willow tits near the observed individual, it was less likely to cache. Willow tits stored food at a greater intensity in the morning than in the afternoon. Yearlings stored more intensively than adults. Individuals differed in their caching intensities. However, there were no significant interactions between the factors investigated, indicating, for example, that individual birds responded similarly to the factors studied. The presence of heterospecific Paridae or non-Paridae had no effect on the caching rate in the willow tit. It is possible that conspecifics are perceived as potential kleptoparasites (immediate threat) or pilferers (long-term threat) and therefore avoided when hoarding.

AB The relationship between parental and alloparental behaviours and prolactin was examined by measuring plasma levels of prolactin in cooperatively breeding Florida scrub-jays during three breeding seasons. The seasonal trends were similar to those in several other avian species, with low prolactin titres during the pre-nesting phase that steadily increased to a maximum during the incubation and nestling periods. Females had higher prolactin levels than males, and breeders had higher levels than non-breeders. Circulating prolactin in non-breeders was elevated prior to the time when they were exposed to a nest or young, suggesting that high prolactin levels were not a simple response to the stimulus of begging young. To further assess correlations between prolactin and parent-like behaviours, the number of nest visits and the amount of food delivered to focal nests was monitored. Prolactin levels were significantly correlated with the number of visits to the nest, as well as the amount of food delivered to the young. Non-breeders that fed nestlings had higher prolactin titres than non-breeders that did not help, lending further support to the hypothesis that helping behaviours are mediated by prolactin.

AB Genetic parentage was examined in the territorial and predominantly monogamous bluethroat, by means of multilocus DNA fingerprinting. Thirty-five per cent (11/31) of nests contained one or more offspring sired by extra-pair males, in total 20% (30/150) of all offspring. The frequency of extra-pair paternity was similar in the two study years. All offspring were genetically related to their putative mother, thus no evidence for intraspecific brood parasitism was found. Extra-pair offspring were not randomly distributed, but were clustered in certain broods, in which on average 54% of the young were sired by extra-pair males. Ten copulations were seen, one of which was an extra-pair copulation. Males guarded their mate intensely around the start of egg laying, staying within 1 m of her for more than 60% of the time. The male typically followed the female, and not vice versa. Henck, mate guarding was not a cooperative behaviour of the two sexes. Male singing activity declined gradually during the breeding season without reaching a peak during the females' fertile period. Male bluethroats thus apparently use mate guarding and not song as their primary paternity guard. For a subset of pairs (N=8) the observed behaviour could be related to paternity. These data indicated that, during the fertile period, there were more intrusions in territories with extra-pair offspring than in territories with only legitimate offspring. There was also a non-significant tendency for males with full paternity in their nest to mate guard more intensely than males with reduced paternity.

AB Moorhens, Gallinula chloropus, are predominantly monogamous, but, annually, 21-35% (N=74-78) of the territories in a high density breeding population of moorhens at Peakirk, Cambridgeshire, were occupied by cooperative breeding groups in which three or more adults collaborated in caring for young from a single nest. In most cases, these consisted of a pair and their previous offspring. Often a mother and daughter laid their clutches synchronously, together in a communal nest. Eggs experimentally introduced into the nest before either female began to lay were rejected, suggesting that communal nesting could not begin until both females had begun to lay. DNA fingerprinting revealed that a polygynous male gained full paternity of all offspring in the communal nest, even when one of the females was his daughter. The deleterious effects of inbreeding were reflected by a low survival rate of offspring that were the products of father-daughter incest. Communal nesting may be the only breeding option for some first-year females that hatch late in the season and overwinter on their natal territories. Mothers do not incur a cost from allowing their daughters to nest communally. However, daughters would do better by leaving and breeding in a monogamous pair if they could. Limited evidence suggested that daughters favoured this option. Consistent with the predictions of current models, the degree of reproductive skew was greater when communally breeding females were relatives than when they were unrelated. The ways in which a predisposition for communal nesting could have facilitated the evolution of intraspecific brood parasitism in this population are discussed.

AB The social behaviour of many species of non-human primates suggests a capacity for both individual and kin recognition. In these species, the ability to signal and perceive identity at a distance may be an important adaptation facilitating intra-group social communication. Variation in vocalizations is hypothesized to provide a basis for this ability. Playback experiments were conducted to test for vocal recognition of contact calls between adult female rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta. Single-trial playbacks of the contact call of either a matrilineal relative or a Familiar, non-relative group member were used to test for discrimination of kin from non-kin. Females responded significantly faster and longer to the contact calls of matrilineal relatives;A habituation-discrimination paradigm was then used to test for individual recognition. Females habituated to successive presentations of different exemplars of the contact calls of one matrilineal relative, then showed a significant rebound in response to the subsequent presentation of a contact call from a second matrilineal relative. These results indicate an ability for vocal recognition of both individuals and kin. Females' responses to playbacks suggested the additional possibility for categorical recognition of matrilineal kinship, or its correlates. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Ontogenetic changes in behaviour often reveal ecological forces that influence particular life-history stages. Postlarval 'algal phase' Caribbean spiny lobsters, Panulirus argus, live solitarily in vegetation, whereas older,'postalgal' juveniles aggregate in crevice shelters. The shelter choice, activity patterns and social influence across the ontogenetic phases that span this period of habitat transition were experimentally examined in mesocosms. Algal juveniles (6-16 mm carapace length; CL) did not seek shelter with conspecifics or alter their activity pattern in their presence. However, postalgal juveniles (24-45 mm CL) both congregated in shelters and altered their activity pattern in the presence of conspecifics. The presence of same-sized conspecifics caused increased walking activity and decreased time spent in algal cover. These particular ontogenetic behavioural changes are concomitant with the habitat shift from vegetation (solitary) to crevice sheltering (aggregated). Social interactions, especially through the formation of groups, may influence the timing and character of the ontogenetic habitat shift in juvenile spiny lobsters.

AB The hermit crabs Clibanarius vittatus and Pagurus pollicaris overlap considerably in the species of gastropod shells occupied. Patterns of epibionts on shells suggested interspecific transfer between the crab species. In laboratory observations, however, even when crabs were highly motivated to get new shells, no direct transfers occurred. This lack of exchanges is correlated with different shell exchange behaviour patterns of the two crab species. When simulated snail predation sites were set up in the laboratory and in the field, indirect interspecific transfers were observed as crabs moved from occupied shells to recently vacated shells.

AB The courtship song of the cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus plays an important role in inducing the female to mount the male, which is necessary for mating. The song consists of a short, amplitude-modulated chirp, followed by a long trill of constant intensity and high syllable rate. Using playback techniques, it was determined which physical parameters of courtship song are necessary and/or sufficient to evoke normal female mounting of muted, courting males. The higher harmonics of natural courtship song were neither necessary nor sufficient for the effectiveness of the song. The chirp component alone was sufficient to evoke normal levels of mounting, but the trill was only partially effective on its own. The conspicuous amplitude modulation of the chirp was not necessary to evoke normal responses. The results suggest that the high effectiveness of the chirp is due to its characteristic temporal pattern. As in other cricket species, the song repertoire of T. oceanicus also includes distinct calling and aggression songs, which contain chirps that are structurally similar to the courtship chirp. Both calling and aggression songs evoked normal mounting responses when played back in the context of courtship. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The effect of burrow acoustics on the reception of sounds by a leptodactylid frog, Eupsophus emiliopugini, from Southern Chile was investigated. Burrows occupied by E. emiliopugini males amplified vocalizations produced by conspecific individuals calling nearby and conspecific calls played back through a speaker positioned in the vicinity of the burrow by 5.2 dB (N=4) and 4.3 dB (N=5) on average, respectively. The spectral contents of calls recorded from inside burrows matched the resonant frequencies of the cavities measured with pure tones. Playback calls of a sympatric species, Batrachyla antartandica, which have spectra that do not overlap E, emiliopugini calls, were not amplified inside burrows to the same extent. Amplification of conspecific calls inside burrows may influence vocal interactions in chorusing assemblages of E. emiliopugini. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Unlike most Old World monkeys, male Barbary macaques frequently associate with and care for infants shortly after birth. Three functional hypotheses have been proposed to explain male-infant interactions in this and other species. (1) The 'paternal investment hypothesis' proposes that males invest in their own progeny or otherwise related infants, (2) the 'mating effort hypothesis' proposes males care for infants to increase their access to mothers, and (3) the 'agonistic buffering hypothesis' proposes that males use infants to regulate their relations with other males. These hypotheses were tested using data on male-infant interactions, paternity and sexual behaviour obtained during a longitudinal study on Barbary macaques living in a large outdoor enclosure. Paternity of 91 infants was determined by DNA fingerprinting. Hypothesis 1 was not supported, because males did not preferentially interact with closely related infants. Similarly, hypothesis 2 was not supported because male caretakers were not more likely to sire the next infant of the mother than non-caretakers. Hypothesis 3 was supported because (1) the direction of at least one type of triadic interactions was significantly biased towards higher-ranking males, (2) the patterning of triadic interactions was strongly dependent on the rank distance between the males, and (3) interaction frequency increased significantly during periods of high inter-male tension. While kin relations were unimportant, the use of infants familiar with the opponent suggests that males make use of their knowledge of relationships between other group members. Beyond agonistic buffering, triadic interactions may serve an important function in coalition formation. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

TI FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF DIFFERENCES IN MALE MATING-BEHAVIOR IN RELATION
   TO FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE STATUS IN FLOUR BEETLES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In those species where females mate multiply, males that mate with non-virgin females will generally share fertilizations with previous mates. As a result, males are expected to have evolved mechanisms to assess female reproductive status to maximize their fertilization success. This study examined whether male flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum, can distinguish between virgin and previously mated females by comparing mating behaviour of males given equal access to females differing in reproductive status. Males preferentially approached and contacted virgin females, and copulated significantly more often with virgin females compared to previously mated females. Female reproductive status did not appear to affect the probability of a copulation attempt once contact had been made with the female, or the probability that a copulation attempt would be successful. Males mating with virgin females gained a significant reproductive advantage compared to matings with previously mated females, siring more progeny with each mating. Possible factors that may influence selection for male ability to distinguish and preferentially mate with virgin females are discussed, including patterns of sperm precedence and female re-mating intervals.

AB Male Madagascar hissing cockroaches, Gromphadorhina portentosa, produce a variety of sounds or 'hisses' during social interactions. The agonistic signals produced during male-male competition were examined, specifically the intra- and inter-individual variation of agonistic hisses, to determine if these sounds could be reliable indicators of male rank or male size. The relationship between characteristics of the agonistic hiss and social rank were also examined. Among males, agonistic hisses ranged from sounds without clear frequency bands to those with frequency modulation. Agonistic hisses varied in dominant frequency, which was measured at the beginning, middle, and end of the hiss, duration, and hiss rate (number per min). Within males, the characteristics of a hiss were repeatable within and between days. Dominant males hissed significantly more than middle-ranking or subordinate males. While dominant, middle-ranking and subordinate males differed in the rate of hissing, there were no significant differences in the duration or dominant frequency of their hisses. Finally, the relationship between male weight and features of agonistic hisses was examined. Both duration and frequency were significantly correlated with male weight. Larger males had longer, lower frequency hisses than smaller males. The possible function of agonistic hissing during male-male interactions and the role of hisses in discrimination between individuals is discussed.

AB In species where sexually advertising males signal in groups, the timing of an individual's signals relative to those of neighbours may be a critical aspect of mating success. Temporal signal interactions and their relation to female attraction were examined in the tarbush grasshopper, Ligurotettix planum. The acoustic signals of neighbouring L. planum males form a crudely alternating chorus. Alternation within male pairs is effected by an (inhibitory resetting) mechanism that causes a male to refrain from calling for at least a 1.8-s interval beginning 0.2 s after the onset of a neighbour's call. This mechanism is not equally applied to all neighbours. Rather, males are selectively inhibited by only their nearest one or two neighbours, whereas more distant, but audible, callers are ignored. Males also time their calls to occur shortly before calls at the ends of predictably recurring silent intervals. Consequently, males do not decrease their calling rates in high population density, and they compete effectively for females. Phonotaxis in L. planum females is characterized by preference for leading calls, a psychoacoustic feature that would select for timing mechanisms that avert the production of following calls in males. The inhibitory resetting mechanism averts such calls. Moreover, because males are only inhibited by nearest neighbours, their strongest competitors, they can avoid producing unattractive following calls and still maintain normal calling rates. By calling at the ends of silent intervals, males may actively compete with neighbours via 'attempting' to relegate the neighbours' calls to ineffective, from the neighbour's perspective, time intervals following the focal male's call.

AB The social preferences of captive, juvenile golden-mantled ground squirrels, Spermophilus lateralis, were studied as a first step towards explaining the development of kin-differential behaviour, which occurs frequently in the genus Spermophilus. Three groups of young (four litters/group) were reared in the laboratory and then transferred as juveniles at about 36 days of age to an outdoor, semi-natural environment in which social interactions between juveniles were recorded. In group 1, littermates (young born to a common dam) were reared together until behavioural observations began. In groups 2 and 3, pups were cross-fostered between dams shortly after birth to examine how rearing (together or apart) and relatedness (littermates or non-littermates) affected juveniles' social interactions in the semi-natural environment. Social interactions were recorded for a 9-14-day period beginning when juveniles reached about 37 days of age, which coincides with when they would come above ground for the first time in nature. In all three groups, juveniles' social preferences were manifested most clearly in social play. In group 1, littermates (reared together) played together about twice as often as non-littermates (reared apart) on a per pair basis, which suggests that a shared rearing environment influenced the development of social preferences. In groups 2 and 3 in which pups had been cross-fostered, play-bout frequencies were ordered (high to low): littermates reared together>non-littermates reared together>littermates reared apart>non-littermates reared apart, and statistical analysis revealed that both rearing and relatedness contributed to this ordering. The sex of a pair also affected play-bout frequencies (M-M>M-F>F-F) independently of rearing and relatedness. Results from S. lateralis are compared with studies on other congeners, including parallel work on S. beldingi, in an effort to link interspecific differences in ecology and social organization to differences in the developmental systems that underlie the extent of kin favouritism in ground squirrels.

AB Female baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, often grunt when approaching lower-ranking females. These grunts appear to have a mollifying effect on subordinates. Observations of 19 adult females conducted over an 11-month period in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, revealed that high-ranking females were less likely to supplant more subordinate females, and more likely to engage in friendly interactions with them, when they grunted to their lower-ranking partners than when they remained silent. Grunts also functioned to reconcile opponents following Sights. In a series of playback experiments, subjects were played the potentially threatening scream of a higher-ranking female that had recently attacked them. Subjects responded less strongly to these screams when the dominant opponent had apparently reconciled after the fight by grunting to them than when the opponent had not interacted with them again. Subjects' responses after a vocal 'reconciliation' were similar to their responses following a control period when the two females had not interacted at all. Even in the absence of more overt friendly behaviour, therefore, baboon grunts act to restore the relationship of opponents to baseline tolerance levels.

AB In contrast to the matrilineal dominance system reported for several primate species, sooty mangabeys, Cercocebus torquatus atys, exhibit a dominance system that is independent of matriline except in the first years of life. Beginning as early as 2-3 years of age, juveniles may begin to outrank both their mothers and other initially higher-ranking individuals. The present study followed 12 juvenile sooty mangabeys ranging in age from 2 to 5 years over a 6-month period to assess the means by which higher dominance rank is attained. Four behavioural patterns were identified: (1) directly challenge a higher-ranking animal (57.1%); (2) join with an aggressor against a higher-ranking opponent (27.6%); (3) challenge a higher-ranking individual while seated next to or in the general area of (and/or grooming) an even higher-ranking animal and then enlist their support against the former (13.4%); and (4) challenge a higher-ranking animal when an adult male is in the area and enlist support of the male (1.8%). The use of the above strategies was not affected by age group or sex. The main points of interest are that juvenile sooty mangabeys do move up the dominance hierarchy using a variety of behavioural patterns and that this is accomplished without aid from matrilineal kin.

AB Black-capped chickadees, Parus atrocapillus, scatter-hoard food and recover items at a later time. Loss of cached food to robbers, however, is high in natural populations. A laboratory study was conducted to determine whether individuals would avoid re-use of storage sites that had been pilfered. Following an initial caching episode, an experimenter pilfered half the stored seeds, and allowed the subject to (1) recover remaining unpilfered seeds, (2) discover pilfered sites and (3) cache seeds. In two trials (N=16, N=13), there was no evidence that the subjects avoided pilfered sites when caching the second time. High cache loss and large numbers of potential cache sites in the wild may preclude the evolution of short-term memory for pilfered sites.

AB The parasitic wasp Bracon hebetor suffers severe inbreeding depression. This study examined two behavioural mechanisms that minimize mating between close relatives. First, the majority of males and females were unwilling to mate immediately upon emergence. Receptivity to mating slowly increased with age of the adult. By the time most individuals were willing to mate, the majority of wasps had dispersed from the natal site. Second, females tended to avoid mating with brood-mates when given a choice between a male that developed on the same host and one that developed on a different host. Experiments using eye-colour mutants and broods composed of relatives and non-relatives indicated that females discriminated against male brood-mates on the basis of environmental cues. Females consistently mated with brothers and non-brothers if they developed on another host, but tended to reject brothers and non-brothers from the same brood as themselves. Females maintained the ability to recognize brood-mates for at least 5 days after eclosion.

TI DISCRIMINATION OF SONG TYPES AND VARIANTS IN SONG SPARROWS

ID REPERTOIRE SIZE; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; RESPONSES
AB Male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, sing highly variable songs. Traditionally, researchers have partitioned this variability by assigning songs to discrete categories termed 'song types', but researchers also have recognized that songs classified as the same song type are themselves variable. Territorial playbacks were used in a habituation/recovery design to investigate whether songs sparrows perceive songs classified as separate song types to be more distinct from one another than songs classified as variants of the same song type. Cluster analysis was used to classify playback songs as song types or variants. Playbacks consisted of focal songs repeated for 1 h, followed by a switch to 6 min of either (1) a second variant of the focal song type from the same source male or (2) a second song type of the same source male. Twelve sets of playback tapes were used in a total of 96 trials. Subjects showed habituation in the response measure (distance to the speaker) during playback of the focal songs. Response recovered for between-song type switches, with mean distance to the speaker decreasing significantly between the last 3 min pre-switch and the first 3 min post-switch, and between the last 6 min pre-switch and the 6 min post-switch. For within-type switches, recovery was significant when comparing only the last and first 3 min. Recovery was significantly greater for between-type switches than for within-type switches on both measures. These results suggest that in the perception of male song sparrows, different song types are more distinct than are different variants of a single type.

AB The influence of the parasitic trematode, Cryptocotyle sp., on male mate choice in a species of pipefish, Syngnathus typhle, was studied. This parasite induces visible black spots in the skin of pipefish, but cannot be transmitted directly from one pipefish to another. In a mate-choice experiment the males spent more time with females with few or no black spots than with females with many black spots. This result was obtained in experiments with natural variation in parasite load, and also in experiments in which black spots were manipulated using tattoo ink. This suggests that males discriminate against parasitized females by using visual cues. In another choice experiment, males did not show any preference between males with or without black spots, suggesting that the discrimination occurs only in a sexual context. There was a negative correlation between parasite load and female fecundity. As a result, males mating with unparasitized females may benefit directly by fertilizing more eggs.

AB Cage cleaning is an unavoidable but frequent source of disturbance for mice maintained in the laboratory. A series of tests was conducted to assess how physical disturbance, the removal of odour cues and exposure to the odours of strangers experienced during cage cleaning affects aggression within established groups of male CFLP mice, Mus musculus. Handling mice decreased the latency to attack and increased the frequency and duration of aggression within groups. Transferring mice into completely clean cages reduced aggression compared to those replaced in home cages that had not been cleaned. Exposure to the odours of strangers while males were held temporarily in a handling bin had no significant effect on aggression when the males were transferred to clean cages or returned to their home cages. Aggression was greatest when mice were replaced in home cages that had not been cleaned but that had a clean sawdust substrate, and decreased with increasing removal of home cage odours on the cage base and grill. Common cage-cleaning practices in which only the substrate and parts of the cage are cleaned, and other procedures that involve daytime handling and replacing mice in their home cage may thus promote aggression within male groups. Transferring mice into completely clean cages is recommended when aggression within caged groups of males is a concern.

AB The hypotheses that variation in male mating success and use of aggression by competing males increase with decreasing synchrony of female arrival were experimentally tested. Groups of three male Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes (Pisces, Oryziidae) were allowed to compete for females that were placed in the tank either simultaneously (synchronous treatment, male-to-female operational sex ratio=0.5) or sequentially (asynchronous treatment, operational sex ratio=3). In these experiments, the mating system of medaka was scramble-competition polygyny because male mating success was primarily determined by their persistence in following and courting females rather than by dominance and aggression. As predicted, the coefficient of variation of male mating success and the rate of aggression by males was higher in the asynchronous than in the synchronous treatment. In addition, the percentage of matings in which a sneaker participated was also higher in the asynchronous than in the synchronous treatment. Operational sex ratio, mediated by female synchrony, seems to be an important proximate factor influencing the intensity of male-male competition. These results suggest that differences between males in their ability to scramble for females can generate important variance in mating success, a mechanism that is often overlooked in the literature on mating systems.

AB In birds, it has proved difficult to demonstrate conclusively that females prefer particular male traits. One problem is that females may sample few males before settling. To circumvent this problem, the mate sampling behaviour of female pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, was followed in the field by using video-cameras, and the plumage colours of the accepted and the rejected males were compared. Females mated preferentially with the more brightly coloured males. In territorial species, another problem in the study of mate choice has been to separate the effect of female choice on the male trait from the effects of territorial quality and other male characteristics, since they will often be intercorrelated. In aviary experiments, the effect of territory quality was controlled for by giving females a mating option between a bright and a dull male, each occupying a nestbox in compartments of the same size. In one experiment, females could choose between males with natural plumage colours (bright versus dull). In another experiment, the effects of age and behavioural correlates of male plumage colour were controlled for by painting one of two dull males bright black. In both these aviary experiments, females preferred the more brightly coloured male. This shows that male plumage colour per se represents a cue for mate choice by female pied flycatchers.

AB Many female primates give loud calls during copulation, the evolutionary function of which has been little investigated. The copulatory behaviour of wild female baboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, was studied to test four hypotheses concerning the function of such calls: reduced inter-birth interval; reduced female harassment; promotion of male-male contest competition (the conventional explanation); and promotion of male-male sperm competition. Data from 157 copulations involving six females produced no evidence that either predation risk or energetic stress was responsible for the observed variation in call production. However, call length did vary consistently with the females' oestrous cycles, peaking at full sexual swelling. Females called in 97% of copulations but ejaculation occurred in only 35% of cases. Calls were given at the end of mounting, following ejaculation when it occurred. They were longest when females mated with adult males and when ejaculation took place. These results are contrary to the first three explanations, but support the hypothesis that female copulation calls promote sperm competition. Calls might thus act to enable females to (1) obtain high quality sperm for their sons, and/or (2) create paternity uncertainty, hence reducing the risk of infanticide. Call production in a unimale group suggests that males from both within and outside the female's social group may be targeted.

ID SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; GROUP-SIZE; BEHAVIOR; RANDOMNESS
AB The temporal organization of vigilance behaviour was examined. The durations of inter-scan intervals of preening sanderlings, Calidris alba, were not predictable from any of the preceding inter-scan interval durations. However, examination of the differences between successive inter-scan interval durations provided a means of describing the sequences: the differences were predictable using models based on negative autocorrelations, Similar results were obtained for sequences from other species. The predictability of vigilance sequences is therefore dependent upon the level of analysis. Some causal and functional interpretations of the derived autoregression models are discussed. Simulations showed that the models could account for periodicities previously reported without invoking oscillatory mechanisms.

AB Female house mice readily learn to retrieve their pups 50 cm from the centre of an open arena and take them to their nest outside the arena's periphery. Experimental manipulation to reveal the spatial-orientation constituents of this behaviour disclosed three submechanisms. Guided orientation, the direct response to objects. Path integration, the continuous monitoring of spatial displacements combined with computation of the locomotor vector to the starting point of the path. Landmark navigation, the movement by means of distal visual cues toward a goal not directly perceived. Learning to home passes through three stages. First, the exploring mouse is directly guided to objects of interest. Second, the homing mouse adds path integration; that is, it keeps a running, integrated spatial record derived from locomotion. Finally (circumstances permitting) the homing mouse links path integration with spatial references to distal visual landmarks. Sparse comparative evidence from other species of rodents suggests that such a system of short-range topographical orientation is universal among rodents.

ID RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD; EXTERNAL VALIDITY; GREAT TIT; SPARROWS;
   PSEUDOREPLICATION; RESPONSES; DIALECTS; HABITUATION
AB In playback experiments, a mismatch between the experimental design and the intended hypothesis often prevents the intended hypothesis from actually being tested. A review of the literature reveals for example, that, despite numerous studies, available data do not provide a strong test of the hypothesis that larger song repertoires are especially stimulating to songbird listeners. Single exemplars are often used to represent all possible repertoires of a given size, i.e. the treatment is unreplicated. Repeated response measures to one repertoire are often then used in statistical tests as if those measures were the mean responses to different repertoires of a given size. Because studies usually do not control for variation present in successive renditions of a single song type, they test for the overall effects of ''song variation'', not specifically for the effects of song type repertoires. Additional concerns include controls for observer-expectancy bias and re-use of either individuals or stimuli to generate inflated sample sizes. Several improved experimental designs are proposed and an increased awareness of these critical issues in experimental reseach in all subfields of animal behaviour is encouraged.

TI THE BASIS FOR CONTROL OF POST-MATING SEXUAL ATTRACTIVENESS BY
   DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER FEMALES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Drosophila melanogaster males court mated significantly less actively than they court virgins. Courtship-inhibiting chemicals (anti-aphrodisiacs) released by mated females when males are presented could play a role in controlling the sexual attractiveness of mated females. To test this hypothesis, the attractiveness of intact mated females, which are able to release aversive chemical signals, was compared to that of decapitated mated females, which do not release the signals. By 24 h after mating, reduced female sexual attractiveness was due almost entirely to anti-aphrodisiacs released when males were present. Anti-aphrodisiacs vary between strains, and have been identified as hydrocarbons found primarily on the cutile of mature males. The quantitiy of these hydrocarbons and mated females increases when males are present, but the increase is not due to transfer from the males. When males with radiolabelled cuticular hydrocarbons were paired with mated females, no transfer of label could be detected. Interstrain comparisons showed that males from one strain do not necessarily respond to the anti-aphrodisiac of another, and that male cuticular hydrocarbons may provide a chemical stimulus that induces release of anti-aphrodisiac by mated females.

TI MALE MATE CHOICE AND FEMALE FEMALE COMPETITION FOR MATES IN THE PIPEFISH
   NEROPHIS-OPHIDION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male mate choice and female-female competition for access to mates were studied in the pipefish Nerophis ophidion, with the aim of evaluating the function and importance of female size and ornamental skin folds. Nerophis ophidion is sex role-reversed in the sense that paternal care limits female reproductive success. Furthermore, females are larger, possess a sexual coloration, and develop an ornamental skin fold during the spawning season. Females are also more active than males during  courtship. In mate-choice experiments males actively preferred both larger females and females with larger skin folds. When several females were kept together, only one female in each group developed a large skin fold. Females interacting only with males invariably developed skin folds whereas isolated females did not. The skin fold affects choice of females by males, and since females are socially stimulated to develop their skin fold, interaction with conspecifics indirectly affects male mate  choice. Female-female interactions may suppress the development of the skin fold. Hence, both active male mate choice based upon female secondary sexual characters and female-female interactions determine the non-random mating pattern observed.

TI ONTOGENY OF MIGRATORY ORIENTATION IN THE SAVANNAH SPARROW,
   PASSERCULUS-SANDWICHENSIS - CALIBRATION OF THE MAGNETIC COMPASS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The ontogeny of magnetic orientation was examined in the savannah sparrow by manipulating the early experience of hand-raised birds with visual and magnetic cues. Tests of magnetic orientation were performed indoors in orientation cages covered by translucent sheets so that the birds could see nothing outside the cages. Control birds, raised entirely indoors, oriented in a magnetic north-northwest to south-southeast axis during autumn migration. Birds raised outdoors, exposed to clear daytime  skies in a normal magnetic field, showed north-south magnetic orientation. Three groups were given experience with the natural sky only within a set of coils that shifted magnetic north clockwise to geographical east-southeast: one group saw only the daytime sky, one group saw only the clear night sky, and the third saw both day and night skies. The birds of all three groups oriented magnetic northeast-southwest, significantly different from the controls. Magnetic northeast-southwest corresponded approximately to geographical northwest-southeast within the magnetic coils in which the birds obtained their visual experience. The differences in the orientation directions chosen by the groups that the primary magnetic compass may be calibrated early in life by some reference to geographical directions. Experience with either the clear daytime or night sky was sufficient to effect this modification. Celestial rotation, which provides a source of geographical directions both day  and night, is proposed to be that geographical reference. At night the birds presumably used the stars to assess celestial rotation. In the daytime sky, both the sun itself and patterns of polarized skylight provide a means of determining geographical north. Experiments designed to determine which of these two visual cues was the relevant stimulus in the calibration of the magnetic compass were inconclusive.

TI MECHANISM OF TEMPLATE-LABEL MATCHING IN FIRE ANT, SOLENOPSIS-INVICTA
   BUREN, NESTMATE RECOGNITION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Aggression bioassays were used to investigate how fire ant workers ''match'' perceived odor labels of encountered individuals with a learned template of nestmate odors. A split-colony design was used, with parent colonies and subcolonies receiving different diets. Diets either shared all components, shared some components but contained no unshared components, or contained both shared and unshared components. Results suggest that workers compared their colony odor template with labels of  encountered kin by ''overall similarity'' rather than by a ''discrete odor mechanism requiring either (1) exact cue correspondence between templates and labels. (2) rejection of an individual whose label contains any cue not present in the template (foreign label rejection), or (3) acceptance of an individual whose label contains any cue present in the template (habituated label acceptance).

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

AB True armyworm males Pseudaletia unipuncta (Haw.) flying upwind toward a 300-.mu.g source of synthetic female pheromone in a wind tunnel were exposed to one of three stimuli: a freshly excised hairpencil (male pheromone gland), a solvent-rinsed hairpencil or a small paintbrush. The proportion of males touching the lure, the time and flight trajectory taken to reach it, and the time spent in attempted copulation with it did not differ significantly between treatments. In a second experiment, males flying to a 30-.mu.g lure were exposed to either a freshly excised hairpencil or a paintbrush. Again, behavioural measures did not differ significantly between treatments indicating that males are not inhibited or repelled by male pheromone.

TI VIGILANCE AND SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION IN 2 SPECIES OF PRIMATES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Animals that live in groups may accrue anti-predator benefits by virtue of their association with other individuals. While a number of factors (e.g. habitat quality, group geometry, dominance rank) have been shown to affect the relationship between group living and individual rates of visual vigilance, sociality and vigilance have not been studied specifically in terms of the two competing demands they impose upon an individual''s visual time. Two captive groups each of tamarins, Saguinus  labiatus, and squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sciureus, were used in three related experiments to determine whether they looked at the social or non-social environment while they engaged in a simulated foraging task. The tamarins, whose social behaviour is quite pacific and cooperative relative to the more hierarchical squirrel monkeys, looked at the non-social environment when they visually interrupted their foraging. Squirrel monkeys, however, looked more often at group mates. Detection of predators is probably more likely when an individual directs its attention not to conspecifics, but to the environment. Hence, social organizations in which individuals must pay social attention in order to monitor threats and a void aggression may reduce individual rates of vigilance for predators. Failure to consider various targets of attention may well overestimate vigilance for predators by including other sorts of attentional phenomena in the measurement of vigilance.

TI BRITTLE-STAR BIOLUMINESCENCE FUNCTIONS AS AN APOSEMATIC SIGNAL TO DETER
   CRUSTACEAN PREDATORS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behaviour of three species of nocturnally active, visually orienting crabs (Portunus sebae, P. spinnimanus and P. ordwayi) was observed to determine whether the luminescent signals produced by Ophiopsila riisei (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) function as an aposematic deterrent against crustacean predators. In repeated experimental trials, crabs showed more rapid rejection of luminescent unpalatable ophiuroids than of non-luminescent controls. After five trials, unpalatable luminescent  prey were rejected three times as quickly as either unpalatable or palatable non-luminescent controls. Over the course of the trials, crabs damaged fewer luminescent ophiuroids than non-luminescent controls. Furthermore, blind crabs (that could not perceive the luminescent flashes) caused significantly more damage to luminescent brittle-stars than did crabs with intact eyes (that could see the light signals). All three species of crab showed increases in avoidance behaviour and decreases in predatory behaviour in response to luminescent ophiuroids versus non-luminescent controls. Ophiopsila riisei survived the majority of crab attacks, and crabs can therefore learn to reject unpalatable luminescent prey without killing them. This suggests that individual selection may be an important mechanism for the evolution of aposematic luminescent signals in this, and probably other, luminescent species.

TI GENETIC DIFFERENCE IN FEMALE CHOICE BETWEEN 2 GUPPY POPULATIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The pattern of mating preferences of female guppies, Poecilia reticulata, differs genetically between two Trinidadian [West Indies] populations. Males from the Aripo and Paria rivers of Trinidad differ in the extent and intensity of orange pigment in their colour patterns. The relative area of orange in Paria colour patterns was nearly twice that in Aripo colour patterns. To test the hypothesis that a difference in female mating preferences could have contributed to the difference in colour patterns, patterns of female choice between laboratory-reared Paria and Aripo females were compared. The frequency of sexual responses to male courtship displays was used to measure the average preference of females for individual males. Paria females discriminated significantly between Paria males based upon differences in the extent of orange in the colour pattern. Aripo females showed no evidence of discrimination between Paria males, and thus differed significantly from Paria females in choice behaviour. Neither group of females discriminated between Aripo males. These results are evidence that female choice behaviour can vary genetically within a species and suggest that differences in preferences may have contributed to divergence in colour patterns among guppy populations.

TI THE EFFECT OF AGE AND VISUAL CUES ON FLORAL PATCH USE BY BANANAQUITS
   (AVES, EMBERIZIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The foraging abilities of naive, hand-reared juvenile bananaquits, Coereba flaveola, were compared to those of captive wild adults foraging in an artificial flower patch containing either open or closed flowers. Foragers removed the tops from covered flowers in order to feed, thereby marking all visited flowers. Open flowers provided no clues as to previous visitation. Adults searched the patch more thoroughly and made fewer flower revisits during each foraging bout than did juveniles. Flower  revisitations by juveniles were more than expected by chance while those made by adults were fewer than expected by chance. This was true for both open and covered flower types. The increase in foraging efficiency with age involves several different characteristics. On open flowers, adults and juveniles differed in the frequency of their patch departures and returns, and in their pattern of turning in the patch, thus resulting in a more complete search of the patch by adults. On covered  flowers, however, the two age classes differed primarily in their patterns of turning, and adults made a more complete search of the patch. Both age classes used the presence or absence of flower covers as a clue to previous visitation.

TI SONG LEARNING IN FEMALE-RAISED ZEBRA FINCHES - ANOTHER LOOK AT THE
   SENSITIVE PHASE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Captive male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, that were raised by females, in complete isolation from adult males, retained the ability to learn song from an adult male when this tutor was later made available to them. Despite their lack of experience of adult males, youngsters recognized the more suitable quality of adult male song, learning it even when they were sexually mature if a tutor became available. They did not use female call notes as song elements unlike those that remained isolated from adult males. The results therefore suggest that, first, young birds do not need to experience adult male song during the dependent period for song learning to occur later and, second, until sufficient suitable material has been heard the sensitive phase remains open-ended, and the young male remains capable of song learning.

TI THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY AND COURTSHIP IN THE
   MELANOGASTER SPECIES SUBGROUP OF DROSOPHILA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Changes in locomotor activity, courtship latency and mating between 1 and 6 days following eclosion and over the 9 h after ''dawn'' were measured for six species of the Drosophila melanogaster species sub-group. No consistent changes in locomotor activity was found for the six species in relation to age or time of day. Male flies were significantly more active than females, with melanogaster, teissieri and yakuba the most active species. D. melanogaster consistently had the highest proportion of pairs copulating and the shortest latencies. D. erecta consistently showed the lowest levels. No effect of time of day was found for courtship latency. Overall there was a tendency for courtship latencies to decrease between 1 and 2 days, with all species showing an increase in latency between 5 and 6 days after eclosion. Negative correlations were found between locomotor activity and courtship latency in both sexes. In melanogaster, simulans and mauritiana, the three species showing the highest levels of copulation, no significant correlations were found between courtship latency and courtship duration. The implications of these results for models of Drosophila courtship are discussed.

TI AVERSIVE-CONDITIONING IN A MODEL MIMIC SYSTEM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When a complement of vertebrate predators was exposed in an experimental field situation to a Batesian mimicry system involving the tenebrionid beetle Eleodes longicollis as the noxious model, and the cerambycid beetle Moneilema appressum as the edible mimic, the predator complement quickly became conditioned to avoid both models and mimics. Meanwhile, predation on familiar prey (the scarab beetle Polyphilla decemlineata) remained high, indicating that the experimental design did not  prevent the predators from eating acceptable prey. Models and mimics were individually placed at risk in plastic buckets in a proportion of six:one; approximately the same proportions that they are found in the field. The model-mimic system was initially sampled by the predators at a relatively high rate, but sampling dropped off within 4 days of exposure of the models and mimics to predation risk. By day 4 of the experiments, sampling had ceased. During the sampling period, models and mimics  were eaten in the same proportions as they occurred in the field, suggesting that the predators did not discriminate between the edible mimic and the noxious model. These results suggest that the selective advantage of mimicry may be very high if the model is noxious enough and the predator complement is not able to distinguish between the model and the mimic.

TI KIN RECOGNITION IN MICE - AGE, SEX AND PARENTAL EFFECTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mice were tested for their ability to discriminate close but unfamiliar kin in pairwise interactions. Pairs were set up to control for the effects of age, sex, and experience with the maternal parent on kin discrimination measured as differences in social interaction between full sibling, half-sibling and unrelated pairs. Comparisons between single-sex pairs showed that, as in previous studies, males and females differed in their patterns of kin discrimination, males showing more investigative activity towards unrelated individuals. No differences emerged between maternal and paternal half-siblings. In mixed-sex pairings, however, the pattern of discrimination depended on the relative ages of males and females. In adult female-juvenile male pairs there was no evidence of kin discrimination, but in adult male-juvenile female pairs discrimination was evident in a wider range of social interactions than in male pairs. Furthermore, adult male-juvenile female pairs showed significant  differences between full and half-siblings and between maternal and paternal half-siblings. This is keeping with the findings of other workers that parental effects on social behaviour in mice are most pronounced in inter-sexual interactions. When pairs were analyzed for age effects, discrimination turned out to be due mainly to differences in the behaviour of adult animals but with some pair-level effects.

AB Dominance-subordinance relationships among a captive group of adult female bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis californiana) were studied from May 1977 to December 1978. Social interactions between females were brief in duration and infrequent. Although a dominance hierarchy was evident among the females, it was not linear. Horn length and body weight were not consistently correlated with social status. The highest ranking females were the most aggressive individuals, initiating more agonistic  interactions than subordinates. Females with high social status did not have higher quality diets, lower activity costs, or higher productivity than low ranking females.

TI NESTMATE RECOGNITION IN SOCIAL WASPS - THE ORIGIN AND ACQUISITION OF
   RECOGNITION ODORS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Laboratory studies of nestmate recognition in gynes (potential queens) of the social wasp, Polistes fuscatus, indicate that recognition odours have both a heritable and an environmental component. In addition, both endogenous odours (acquired as brood) and adult-acquired odours appear to mediate nestmate recognition. Heritable and environmental, as well as endogenous and adult-acquired recognition odours, are not additive in their effect on tolerance, suggesting a ''cue similarity threshold''  model of recognition rather than a model that postulates tolerance continuously increasing with increasing degree of similarity between the learned and perceived cue. Young gynes (1.7-71.8 h after emergence) clearly possess recognition odours and there is no evidence that the age of a young gyne affects its expression of recognition odours. The failure of a wasp, isolated from its natal nest at emergence, to recognize its nestmates is due to the disruption of its learning of recognition odours, not to its acquisition of recognition odours. Gynes appear not to learn recognition odours directly from themselves. Young gynes deprived of the opportunity to learn recognition odours from their natal nest treat all gynes as nestmates, regardless of relatedness. This latter result, together with additional evidence, suggests that the ontogeny of nestmate recognition ability involves the development of intolerance to unfamiliar odours rather than the development of tolerance to familiar  odours.

TI MALE MATE CHOICE IN FISHES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Selection generally favours male competition for females, and female mate choice of mates. If, however, females vary in quality, and if males are limited in the maximum number of females with which they can mate, then selection should also favour male mate choice. We report on male mate choice in two species of fishes with different mating systems: the threespine stickleback, which has male parental care, and the coho salmon, which has female parental care. In both species, males allocated their mating effort in direct proportion to female quality.

TI ON THE NATURE OF LEARNING IN OVIPOSITION SITE ACCEPTANCE BY APPLE MAGGOT
   FLIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a previous study, we found that after a female apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, had arrived on a host fruit, its propensity to accept (bore into) or reject that fruit prior to egg deposition was modifiable through experience, and hence involved learning. Here, we aimed to determine whether the true nature of the learned response was either (a) one in which a conditioned female, as a result of having become familiar with a particular fruit type, formed a greater propensity to accept that type in a future encounter than had a naive female, or (b) one in which a conditioned female formed no greater propensity to accept a particular fruit type but simply was less prone than a naive female to accept a novel fruit type. The results of two experiments supported the latter mechanism, while the results of a third experiment provided evidence for both mechanisms. The possible adaptive significance of learning to refuse a novel resource type is discussed.

TI FORAGING JUNCOS - INTERACTION OF REWARD MEAN AND VARIABILITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent stochastic theories of feeding strategy propose that a risk-averse forager will trade off increases in reward variability against increases in average reward. Two models of risk-aversion (variance discounting and the z-score model) imply different forms for this interaction of mean and variability. Variance discounting suggests constant risk-aversion, since the effect of reward variance on expected fitness is assumed to be independent of the mean. The z-score model suggests decreasing risk-aversion, since the effect of a given level of reward variance on expected fitness is assumed to decrease as the mean increases. Two series of experiments were made with dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis). Each series investigated the mean-variability trade-off under physiological conditions promoting risk-aversion; reward sizes were generally greater in the 2nd series. The results clearly indicate a trade-off, but within a series the data do not discriminate between the 2 models''  predictions. Comparing the 2 series suggests that the juncos'' level of aversion to reward variability decreases after an overall increment in environmental profitability.

TI INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ADULT ROBINS AND CHICKS BELONGING TO OTHER PAIRS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Adult robins are able to discriminate between chicks hatched in their own and in other territories. The latter are much less likely to be fed and are more likely to be attacked than the adult''s own young. As chicks grow older they become less likely to beg at adults other than their parents. Adults rarely feed chicks from other territories unless they have fledged young of their own. Possible causes of these different responses are discussed and it is emphasized that these need not involve individual recognition. Males appear to be more likely than females to feed chicks hatching in other territories. This could be the result of the females learning about their chicks while brooding them. Males may benefit more, on average, from feeding other pairs'' chicks than do females. There has been a previous report that robins are unable to make the discriminations reported in this paper and possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. It is conceivable that it reflects a  difference between populations.

   BOUSFIELD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB In G. lawrencianus, females of a given fecundity and proximity to copulation day are assessed by males to be more valuable as mates, the longer the males have amplexed with the females (i.e., the greater their past investment in the act of amplexus). This behavior is consistent with the hypotheses that males are uncertain of the true reproductive state of a female on 1st contacting her; the prior distribution of unamplexed females likely to be encountered by the males affects their initial estimates of a female''s state; and the time spent amplexing with a female allows information to be gathered which reduces a male''s uncertainty of the famele''s state.

TI MODELS OF PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT .5. EFFECTS OF THE BEHAVIOR OF THE 2
   PARENTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In the absence of any parent-offspring conflict, the total parental investment per offspring should be less when 2 parents collaborate for the offspring than when only 1 parent invests. This does not necessarily mean that offspring fare less well when both parents invest. The ''ideal'' amount of parental investment for an offspring to take is always greater than is ''ideal'' for the parent to allocate (Trivers 1974). The offspring''s optimum is higher if the offspring''s action affects the reproductive success of only one parent and lower if both parents are affected (e.g., 2-parent investment, or lifelong monogamy). The difference between the parental optimum and the offspring optimum depends on the mating system and on the form of conflict (between successive broods, or within broods), and prescribes a ''conflict range''. The extent of conflict cannot be deduced solely from a knowledge of the average relatedness between siblings. The conflict is likely to be resolved by an ESS [evolutionarily stable strategy] in which intermediate (compromise) levels of investment are paid out to offspring, which nevertheless continue to make costly demands for yet more investment. The degree of conflict can be measured by the extent to which offspring subject their parents to aggressive demands for extra investment, and is likely to be greater when 2 parents collaborate equally over investment than when only 1 parent invests. When only 1 parent invest, conflict is higher if sibling-competition is between siblings in the same broods (intra-brood) than when it is between progeny in successive broods (inter-brood). The reverse will tend to be the case when both parents invest equally.

TI EVIDENCE FOR RELIABLE BADGES OF STATUS IN TERRITORIAL YELLOW WARBLERS
   (DENDROICA-PETECHIA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID PLUMAGE VARIATION; SEXUAL SELECTION; DOMINANCE; COLORATION; EVOLUTION;
   SPARROWS; STRATEGY; AGE
AB We examined the continuous variation in the breeding plumage of male yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia) to determine if the amount of brown streaking on the breast function as a badge of relative status in territorial males. Conspecific mounts differing in the amount of breast streaking were presented as simulated intruders to a sample of territorial males. Individual males exhibited higher levels of total aggressive response toward brighter models, i.e. those with more brown streaking.  This indicates that the streaking is used to assess prospective opponents prior to a response, and that bright intruding males are regarded as more of a threat to the resident than are duller males. The level of response was also correlated with the brightness of the resident males. Bright males responded more aggressively than duller residents to model presentations, and also allocated more time and effort to territory maintenance. We conclude from this that bright males are signalling social dominance, but suggest that the proximate source of high status is a costly increase in the level of aggressive motivation, and not simply an intrinsic superiority in fighting competence. Thus the amount of brown streaking would be a reliable signal of the level of aggressive effort a male is willing to expend in escalating contests and defending resources. We propose that the reliability of the signal is ultimately maintained by the use of different, but, overall, equally successful  reproductive strategies by males of different appearance. An important implication of this is that ''cheating'' on signalled status may be neither possible nor necessary.

TI MECHANISMS AND EVOLUTION OF INTER-MALE SPACING IN THE PAINTED REEDFROG
   (HYPEROLIUS-MARMORATUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Inter-male spacing in Hyperolius marmoratus choruses was studied at a natural breeding site. Calling males maintain minimum inter-individual distances of 50 cm. Agonistic behaviour and encounter calling appear to help maintain spacing. Males wrestle with one another by grappling with their forelimbs and attempt to displace each other with powerful kicks from the hindlimbs. Acoustic playback experiments demonstrated that inter-male spacing was vocally mediated and that signal intensity  provides cues regarding the proximity of near neighbours. When given a choice of three identical calls, differing only in their spatial separation, females displayed selective phonotaxis to the most widely spaced call. Such discrimination by females must generate strong selective pressure for males to maintain adequate spacing if they are to attract mates successfully.

TI HEARING AND COMMUNICATION IN BLUE MONKEYS (CERCOPITHECUS-MITIS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Hearing and vocal communication in blue monkeys (C. mitis) was studied within an ecological context. Field measurements of the acoustical characteristics of the blue monkey''s natural habitat were conducted in the Kibale forest (Uganda) and in Kakamega forest (Kenya). Measurements of background noise levels indicated that vocal communication pitched in the 100-1000-Hz frequency band would be relatively unimpeded by disruptive background noises. Measurements of the propagation rate of audio signals indicated that cells pitched in the 125-200-Hz region penetrated the forest with minimal decrement in amplitude. Tests of the blue monkey''s acoustic sensitivity and range of hearing were conducted in the laboratory with standard audiometric procedures. Hearing in the blue monkey was characterized by a U-shaped function, with maximum sensitivity of about 5 dB SPL [sound pressure level] spanning a 4-octave range from 1-16 kHz. The hearing of blue monkeys was superior to human hearing for tones below 500 Hz and above 8 kHz infrequency. A comparative analysis of primate hearing indicated that the blue monkey was approximately 18 dB more sensitive to low-frequency tones than the comparably sized, semi-terrestrial rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). Blue monkeys exhibit phonatory specializations for vocal production in this relatively unused, low-frequency band of 125-200 Hz. These specializations for low-frequency vocal production and low-frequency hearing collectively act to increase the effective  distance of long-range acoustic communication in the forest canopy.

TI FORAGING PREFERENCES - RESPONSE TO REWARD SKEW
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent theoretical and empirical work on foraging behavior suggests that animals may respond to both the means and variances in benefits associated with available resources. This analysis is extended by asking if reward skew (3rd moment about the mean) might influence preference when 2 options have equal means and equal variances. How minimizing the probability of starvation might induce response to skew was examined. An expected fitness model is developed which follows from economic theory and  indicates more general conditions concerning responses to skew. Experiments are reported involving foraging white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys). Under conditions where positive skew should be favored, the birds'' behavior supports the prediction. Their response to skew is not as strong as responses to variance noted in the same individuals.

TI NIPPLE-SEARCH PERFORMANCE BY RABBIT PUPS - CHANGES WITH AGE AND TIME OF
   DAY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Developmental changes in the nipple-search behavior of rabbit pups (O. cuniculus) were investigated from day 1-day 13. The performance of 4 litters was tested 1 h before and 6 h after the once-daily nursing and of 2 litters 6 h before and 1 h after nursing on lactating does restrained on their back. During the 1st 5 days, the median times taken by pups to attach to nipples decreased from 11.8-3.2 s. This improvement was mainly due to a decrease in the latency to search and suggested an  improvement in the ability to react to the nipple-search pheromone. Except for the 1st day, pups located nipples faster before than after nursing and were best 1 h before. After the 1st wk, latencies to search remained minimal at this time, but increased again at the other times and were longest on day 13 at 1 h after nursing. Performance changes with time of day corresponded to daily changes in activity and, after the 1st week, suggested a further development of underlying motivational mechanisms.

DT Article
AB The maternal behavior of 3 species of voles was compared using a semi-naturalistic laboratory system. Meadow vole females spent more time out of the nest, and exhibited less maternal behavior in terms of nursing and brooding, and more non-social behavior such as locomoting, eating, and drinking, than the females of the other 2 species. Across all species, maternal behavior decreased from parturition onward, while non-social behavior increased. Paternal care was well developed in the prairie vole and pine vole, but was never observed in the meadow vole. During the 1st postnatal wk, male prairie voles showed a tendency to enter the nest when the female left the young unattended. This trend was not apparent in the male pine vole. The physical parameters of pup development, including eye opening and the development of fur, were similar in all 3 species. Behavioral development was most rapid in the meadow vole, intermediate in the prairie vole, and slowest in the pine vole. These results were compared with those of previous field and laboratory studies, and were discussed with reference to the life-history strategy of each species.

TI APPLICATION OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD PAIRED COMPARISON RANKING TO
   ESTIMATION OF A LINEAR DOMINANCE HIERARCHY IN ANIMAL SOCIETIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Dominance hierarchies have been widely used for describing the outcome of competitive interactions in an animal group. A procedure for estimating the linear dominance hierarchy is presented. The procedure uses the statistical method of paired comparisons, assuming weak stochastic transitivity to model interactions within a linear dominance hierarchy. The linear dominance hierarchy is estimated using a maximum likelihood ranking procedure. This method allows unequal numbers of encounters between pairs and does not require all pairs to have observed encounters. The method is illustrated by application to behavioral data from a group of 10 baboons (Papio cynocephalus anubis).

TI BARN SWALLOW MOBBING - SELF-DEFENCE, COLLATERAL KIN DEFENSE, GROUP
   DEFENSE, OR PARENTAL CARE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Stimuli (human and stuffed owl) were presented to a marked population of barn swallows (H. rustica) during the 1980-1982 breeding seasons at the Cranberry Lake Biological Station, Saint Lawrence County, New York [USA]. In experiment 1, the stimuli were presented at various distances from active nests during various stages of the reproductive cycle. Both the probability and intensity of mobbing varied during the breeding season, increasing with the probable reproductive value of young of the year and the degree of danger posed to them. Mobbing group sizes varied positively with local nest densities. In experiment 2, mobbing group structure was analyzed in greater detail. Barn swallow mobbing groups usually contained active mobbers (those that emitted mobbing calls, and approached the stimulus closely, < 2 m, or even hit it) and passive mobbers (which were silent and flew in circles at greater distances, 2-10 m, from the stimulus). Passive mobbers were a random sample of the local population with respect to sex, age, nest location and reproductive status. This pattern is consistent with a hypothesis that passive mobbing, the less risky type, is a form of self-defense that reduces an actor''s chance of being eaten, probably by providing information about the identity or probable behavior of potential predators. Active mobbers were not a random sample of the source population. Mated birds and especially parents with nestlings were over-represented; non-breeders, juveniles and incubators rarely mobbed actively. The seasonal changes in mobbing and the identity of active and passive mobbers are inconsistent with hypotheses that mobbing is a form of cooperative group defense or altruism conditioned by reciprocity or kin or group selection. The data are consistent with other hypotheses which propose that mobbing benefits the mate or the young. Even though active mobbers may be at risk, they benefit directly by increasing the personal component of their inclusive  fitness, probably by alerting mates and young and defending them from predators. In this light the behavioral complex of mobbing appears to be a form of parental care (active) as well as self-defense (passive) and mate defense (active).

TI THE PROBABILITY OF LINEARITY IN HIERARCHIES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The common practice of ranking a group of animals in the closest possible order to a linear dominance hierarchy assumes that dominance among those animals is generally transitive. Analysis of groups in which dominance relationships are random shows that this method has a surprisingly high probability of producing an apparently linear or near-linear hierarchy by chance. The existence of transitive dominance should be tested before it is used in ranking. A suitable statistical test is described here. Chance may also contribute to the linear appearance of hierarchies based on other factors.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of estradiol benzoate (OB) administration on running-wheel activity was compared in gonadectomized male, female and neonatally androgenized female rats. In the 1st experiment, conducted on 300-400-day-old animals, OB stimulated running-wheel activity of female rats to a significantly greater extent than that of males or neonatally androgenized females. In the 2nd experiment, conducted on 91-day-old rats, females exhibited maximal activity at lower doses of Ob than males. Previous experiments have shown that open-field activity, a putative measure of susceptibility to fear, is subject to group differences in OB responsiveness (i.e. between male, female, androgenized female) which parallel those seen in the present study; gender differences in open-field activity may reflect group differences in general activity rather than male/female differences in emotionality or susceptibility to fear.

TI ORGANIZATION AND PATTERNS OF INTER SPECIFIC AND INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION
   IN THE BEHAVIOR OF DROSOPHILA LARVAE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Larval behavior is described in terms of a series of discrete components, the frequencies of which vary in relation to environmental factors. The rate of locomotion is high in the absence of food and reduced when feeding occurs on a suitable food source. If larvae encounter food containing a high concentration of ethanol they show a decrease in feeding rate and an increase in locomotor activity. This may be a behavioral response to suboptimal nutritional conditions involving potential alcohol toxicity. Larvae of D. melanogaster and D. simulans exhibit both inter- and intraspecific variation in the frequency of behaviors. The organization of larval behavior, represented in ethograms showing the patterns of transitions between elements, is comparatively stable across species, strains and environments. Functional significance of the different behaviors is discussed.

AB Field experiments using models showed that Darwin''s ground finches (Geospiza) can recognize conspecifics by their morphology. In choice experiments, males and females respond more aggressively towards male conspecific models than towards heterospecifics. Females also prefer to attack conspecific female models. Males preferentially court conspecific females in natural encounters and during experiments. Species recognition by males is an important component of premating isolation in the genus. Bill size by itself does not function as a sign stimulus; recognition depends on combined stimuli of both the head and body.

Matching is a graded function of song dissimilarity: the more similar the stimulus song is to the bird''s own song of the same type, the less it is matched.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of prior residence on contests for status within dominance hierarchies of captive male dark-eyed juncos (J. hyemalis) were studied to test predictions of a game-theory model of contest behavior (Maynard Smith and Parker 1976; Hammerstein 1981). Several predictions of the model were supported. Encounters between birds that were equally matched in size, age, experience and prior residence were more aggressive than those involving residents and non-residents of equal size, age and experience. Residents usually dominated non-residents when the contestants were equally matched in size, age and experience. In a few cases, residents dominated non-residents that may have been slightly superior in other respects as measured by previous dominance rank, but in most cases, superior non-residents dominated residents. Not all predictions of the game-theory model were supported.

LA English
DT Article
AB Tracking radar and visual observation techniques were used to observe the orientation of free-flying passerine nocturnal migrants in situations in which potentially usable directional cues were absent or gave conflicting information. When migrants had seen the sun near the time of sunset and/or the stars, they oriented in appropriate migratory directions even when winds were opposed. Under solid overcast skies that prevented a view of both sun and stars, the birds downwind in opposing winds and thus moved in seasonally inappropriate directions. The data point to the primacy of visual cues over wind direction, with either sun or stars being sufficient to allow the birds to determine the appropriate migration direction.

TI BEHAVIORAL DOMINANCE AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN FEMALE JAPANESE MONKEYS
   (MACACA-FUSCATA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Eight years of reproductive data (including 248 birds) from a translocated troop of Japanese monkeys (M. fuscata) living in a 42-ha enclosure provided 3 measures of female reproductive success: fecundity, survival of infants to 1 yr of age, and age at 1st parturition. No significant relationship was found between social dominance and these measures. Social dominance was considered with respect to both matrilineal and individual female rank. Additional data on female dominance ranks over 4 generations of adult females revealed no significant concordance over time. The finding that ranks may not be stable over the lifetime of a female is a significant one because the variation in reproductive success among the females of a group is likely to be further diminished by any instability. For 34 females that were adults for the 8-yr period considered, no significant correlation was seen between the average rank of a female and either fecundity or survivorship of infants to 1 year of age. These data considered along with the results of other studies of female dominance and reproduction suggest that any effect of female social dominance on reproductive success is probably dependent upon resource availability, significant benefits accruing to high-ranking individuals only during subsistence periods. Dominance competition among female macaques may be a behavioral strategy with a variable payoff.

Previous attempts to suggest functions for time-sharing are incorrect. If time-sharing is to make functional sense, there must in general be some asymmetry in the costs and benefits of the activities involved.

TI BEHAVIORAL SHIFT FROM COURTSHIP SOLICITATION TO MATE AVOIDANCE IN FEMALE
   RINGLET BUTTERFLIES (APHANTOPUS-HYPERANTHUS) AFTER COPULATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In butterflies where nutrients contributed to males through mating are caused by females for egg production and/or somatic maintenance, females may benefit from mating more than once. In species where sperm is used only for the fertilization of eggs and the sperm received in one copulation is sufficient for fertilization of all of the eggs, females should benefit from mating only once. In these species the reproductive success of females is likely to be proportional to the time they can allocate to egg-laying activities. Thus these females should be selected to minimize the time spent in an unmated condition, and to minimize time-consuming interactions, like courtship, with males after mating. As shown by spermatophore counts, females of the ringlet butterfly, A. hyperanthus, generally mate only once. These females exhibited behavior consonant with the above view: they solicit courtship before copulation and actively avoid males after mating.

AB The intensity of nest-defense aggression by female redwinged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) with eggs decreased late in the breeding season, while aggression at this time increased among females defending broods. High predation pressure late in the breeding season decreased the probability of survival of the late nesting attempts, so that females with young had a much greater chance of success than females with eggs at this time. The observed changes in aggressive responses are predicted by the theory of parental investment.

AB An objective method for defining a play bout is derived and applied to data collected from 6 143- to 146-day-old captive marmosets living in family groups. Temporal patterns within and between play bouts are investigated. There is a tendency for play bouts to occur in sessions. Play sessions are terminated by short rather than long play bouts. The pattern of components within play bouts is non-random. Chasing tends not to be performed either at the beginning or at the end of a play bout. Typical latencies from play bout onset to the onset of components within the bout vary from one component to another. Mechanisms controlling social play must operate at 2 levels: the play sessions, and the play bout.

TI FOOD STORING BY MARSH TITS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Wild marsh tits (P. palustris) were allowed to hoard radioactively labeled sunflower seeds, which were subsequently formed using a portable scintillation counter. Seeds were stored singly, in various sites close to the ground. Different birds favored different types of sites, although this preference was changeable. Seed density decreased with increasing distance from the feeder, and there was a negative correlation between seed sequence number and the distance it was carried. Hoarded seeds disappeared more rapidly than control seeds in identical sites 100 cm away, suggesting that the birds remember their exact location. Seeds tended to be stored and recovered in the same sequence. The adaptive significance of these results is discussed.

AB The ability of minnows to accept home ranges in aquarium tanks was confirmed. Observation of individually marked fish indicated that there was variation in the tendency for individual movement. Minnows which spent the majority of their time at home showed differences in the number of forays out of their home area. Nonhoming fish also varied from individuals which moved a lot and showed no preference for any area to others which spent most of their time in a strange area and made few forays.

TI AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF SCENT-MARKING IN COYOTES, CANIS-LATRANS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Urination and defecation patterns of free-ranging coyotes (C. latrans) were studied in the Grand Teton National Park, Jackson, Wyoming [USA], for 2 yr. The vast majority of urinations by adult males and females was involved in marking and differentiating between marking and elimination may not be necessary. Raised-leg urinations (RLU) performed by males were most frequently used in marking. Females marked throughout the year using the squat (SQU) posture. Snow tracking and reading snow sign resulted in a gross underestimate of the relative frequency of SQU and a large overestimate in the relative frequency of defecations (DEF) when compared to results obtained by direct observation. There was sexual dimorphism for the contexts in which marking occurred. Marking by males was associated with courtship and mating, with traveling and with aggression. Marking by famles was associated with the acquisition and possession of food and with the denning season. Marking rates per coyote increased in groups larger than 2 animals. RLU marking rates were greatest in areas of high intrusion when compared to denning areas and areas in which non-group members infrequently trespassed. SQU marking rates were highest in denning areas and high-intrusion areas. Scent odors may be important in orienting individuals in space but do not represent barriers to movement.

TI VALIDATING THE FEMALE BIOASSAY OF COWBIRD SONG - RELATING DIFFERENCES IN
   SONG POTENCY TO MATING SUCCESS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female cowbirds (M. ater), maintained in isolation from males during the breeding season, respond to the playback of male song with copulatory postures. They respond more often to some songs than others. Song potency can be operationally defined by the number of copulatory responses a song elicits. This measure of song potency was validated by investigating its relationship to mating success. Two colonies of cowbirds were observed during the breeding season and details of their courtship were recorded. Song potency of the males was tested by playback with a different group of captive females. The results indicate a relationship between maximum song potency and mating success: the males that obtained the most copulations had songs of higher maximum potency and were more dominant during the winter and early spring.

TI THE ROLE OF HOOD-BUILDING IN DEFINING TERRITORIES AND LIMITING COMBAT IN
   FIDDLER CRABS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In Panama, courting males of 3 spp. of fiddler crabs sometimes construct semi-domes of mud (= hoods) over their burrow entrances. Males that do not construct hoods court in a circular area surrounding their burrow entrance. Males with hoods restrict their general activity and courtship to the semi-circular area in front of the hood opening. For Uca latimanus hoods are an integral part of the courtship ritual and are constructed by all courting males. In the other 2 spp., U. musica terpsichores and U. beebei, hood-building is associated with high population density and the presence of hoods reduces the frequency of combat among neighboring males.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB Courtship turning of the male German cockroach, B. germanica, was analyzed with respect to rotational and translational movements. Three different sources of orientation information are postulated for the control of this behavior: external sensory information (perception of sex pheromone) releases courtship, proprioception from the legs is required to curtail turning when the specified turn angle is reached, and internally stored information determines the sign of turning and patterns the courtship actions.

TI VIGILANCE AND GROUP-SIZE IN OSTRICHES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Wild ostriches were observed while feeding alone or in groups of up to 4 birds and their vigilance (proportion of time with the head up) was recorded. Individual vigilance declined as group size increased, mainly through a decrease in the frequency with which the head was raised. Males were more vigilant than females, mainly because they kept their heads up longer. Vigilance was influenced more by the presence than by the vigilance of a companion. It was impossible for a predator to predict when a head would stay down for a long time. Grouping by ostriches when feeding results in only a slight reduction in the group''s vulnerability to successful predator attack, but in a considerable decrease in individual vulnerability.

TI MATING SYSTEMS, PHILOPATRY AND DISPERSAL IN BIRDS AND MAMMALS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Review
AB Many species of birds and mammals are faithful to their natal and breeding site or group. In most of them one sex is more philopatric than the other. In birds it is usually females which disperse more than males; in mammals it is usually males which disperse more than females. Reproductive enhancement through increased access to mates or resources and the avoidance of inbreeding are important in promoting sex differences in dispersal. The direction of the sex bias is a consequence of the type of mating system. Philopatry will favor the evolution of cooperative traits between members of the sedentary sex. Disruptive acts will be a feature of dispersers.

TI MEAL OCCURRENCE IN JAPANESE QUAIL IN RELATION TO PARTICLE-SIZE AND
   NUTRIENT DENSITY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Japanese quail ate shorter meals with pellets than with mash, and longer and more frequent meals with diluted mash (40% cellulose) than undiluted mash. The differences with particle size were due to different rates of ingestion, and those with nutrient density to different meal volumes and different rates of passage. Average meal size was about the same with all foods in terms of weight eaten, but not nutrients digested. Short-term adjustments in feeding were concerned mainly with changes in meal frequency, and longer-term adjustments mainly with changes in meal size. The control of meal-eating may be concerned with emptying and filling of the digestive tract and not with changing levels of circulating nutrients, and parts of the gut that may be involved are suggested.

AB A method is described for determining the speed above which the mink can no longer reliably perceive the direction of movement of a stimulus. An electronic logic system controlled presentation of the stimulus, a bright spot of flight, 4 mm in diameter, subtending an angle of 2.4 min at the eye, which was moved across a viewing screen representing 77.degree. C of visual field in the left or right horizontal direction. The stimulus speed at which the mink could no longer discriminate direction was approximately 300 cm s-1. It is suggested that this threshold represents behavioral rather than physiological limitation. The result is discussed in terms of the hunting behavior of the mink.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An experiment aimed at testing whether foraging efficiency for great tits is limited by light intensity at the time of the dawn chorus is discussed. Captive great tits hunting for prey under different luminance conditions were less successful in finding prey when foraging, hunted for a lower proportion of their time, and handled individual prey items for longer when luminance was under approximately 7 cd/m2. This luminance is not reached in the field until after the time of the dawn chorus, suggesting that in the early morning foraging is limited by light intensity. A satisfactory functional explanation of the dawn chorus might take into account the comparatively low foraging opportunity early in the morning, and the factors affecting the opportunity for singing and other territorial activities.

Songs associated with sexual and aggressive behaviors are similar in structure; female mate choice may have driven sexual selection in favor of the more aggressive males. Song sequence is non-random with repetition of all song types and alternation of some, and songs with similar messages are often associated in sequence. Predictions from alternative models were tested, but the significance of the large song repertoire in this species is largely explained by the message content of the different song types.

Changes in female behavior, which could be related to known changes in her hormonal state, resulted in changes in the male-female interaction not only at estrus but also within the 3 diestrous days of the cycle. These changes were in the amount of time the animals spent together or apart. This in turn was affected by which sex initiated the approaches and leaves. During estrus proximity measures correlated well with latency to 1st lordosis which is a sensitive measure of degree of receptivity. Proximity measures provide a detailed description of the male-female interaction and should prove useful in studying the effects of experimental alteration of previous experience and hormonal state.

TI EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO MALES ON SEXUAL PREFERENCE IN FEMALE MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female mice born and reared in a room housing both adult males and females preferred normal males to castrated males when tested at 15 wk of age, even if there had been no males in the same cage. By contrast, females born and raised in a room housing no males preferred castrated males to normal males. Even without direct contact exposure to males for 4 days within 4 wk of age was sufficient to produce postpuberal preference for normal males. Females exposed to males for 4 days between 14 and 25 days of age preferred normal males even after sexual experience with preputialectomized males. The learning process resembles imprinting.

TI QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSES OF ONTOGENY OF PREDATORY BEHAVIOR IN COYOTES,
   CANIS-LATRANS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Infant coyotes (4 C. latrans) were studied in order to describe quantitatively the development of predatory behavior. Prior play and agonistic experience had virtually no effect on later predatory success. There was no relationship between an individual''s social rank and its prey-killing ability. Latency to kill was shortened when animals were tested in, pairs and hunger level was not related to latency to kill. The results are discussed with respect to current ''functionalist'' theories of play behavior and Layhausen''s concept of the relative hierarchy of moods. The practice theory of play should be reconsidered in light of the results of this and other recent studies.

TI EFFECT OF MATING ON RESPONSE OF FEMALE PHOTURIS FIREFLY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Laboratory cultured virgin fireflies (P. versicolor) answered triple flashes of intervals 200 to 550 ms significantly more frequently than field-captured femmes fatales while the latter answered double flashes of 600-1950 ms significantly more frequently. Laboratory cultured virgins mated to sterile males did not answer double or triple flashes of any interval class but maintained the courtship posture. Mating probably terminates virgin answering behavior but something transferred by the male seems necessary to induce femme fatale behavior.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Vocalizations and associated behavior of 6 mated pairs of captive pinon jays (G. cyanocephalus) were recorded under various conditions in an effort to understand functions of the calls. One vocalization, the near, was analzyed for components that would allow for individual recognition by pinon jays. Fifteen vocalizations are recognized and most are described quantitatively. Much gradation occurs within and between calls, which may allow for a subtle and complex system of communication in this highly social species. Wild flocks of pinon jays were observed to corroborate the conclusions.

TI SOCIAL SYSTEM OF ROUND-TAILED GROUND SQUIRRELS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The social system of round-tailed ground squirrels Spermophilus tereticaudus is quantitatively described in terms of seasonal changes in interaction rates, the effect of age and sex on type and frequency of interaction, the differential response to kin and non-kin, the determinants of dominance, including territoriality, the associations between classes of individuals, and the dispersion of home ranges and core areas. From Jan. to March, the adult squirrels were sociable and non-territorial. Following copulation in March, they were unsociable and territorial. In May and June, juveniles lived mainly within their mothers'' territories. Those juveniles that did not disperse from the study area in late June established territories near their mothers. From Sept. to Dec., all squirrels were inactive underground.

TI CHICKS PREFERENCES FOR FAMILIAR AND NOVEL CONSPICUOUS OBJECTS AFTER
   DIFFERENT PERIODS OF EXPOSURE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When length of exposure to a flashing rotating light was varied, the subsequent preferences of day-old chicks for the familiar object 1st increased as a function of exposure, then decreased and finally increased once again. The temporary reversal of the trend for an increasingly restricted preference for the familiar object occurred after 30 min of exposure. The reversal was not critically dependent on the time from exposure to testing. It is attributed to the chicks'' preferences for slight novelty which were superimposed on their growing preference for familiarity.

TI VOCAL REPERTOIRE OF CHIPMUNKS (GENUS-EUTAMIAS) IN CALIFORNIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A study of the vocalizations of chipmunks was conducted in the field and laboratory, utilizing sonagrams made from tape recordings, and observational data. Most observations were made on Eutamias townsendii, but interspecific variation in alarm calls was studied in all 10 California [USA] species of Eutamias [E. alpinus, E. minimus, E. amoenus, E. panamintinus, E. umbrinus, E. speciosus, E. quadrimaculatus, E. merriami, E. sonomae]. The vocal repertoire of Eutamias includes several alarm calls: the chip, chuck, chippering, and in some species also the trill, and in other the whistle. Other calls include the agonistic chatter, courtship chatter, growl and squeal. The chip is the most common call. There is consistent interspecific variation in structure and temporal arrangement of chips. Most of this variation correlated with body size.

DT Article
AB Crickets appear to rely less upon olfactory communication than do their non-acoustical relatives, but males and females of house (Acheta) and field (Gryllus) crickets can determine sex by odor, and males can distinguish odors of conspecific and heterospecific females. In the presence of female odors, female-deprived males groom more vigorously and are more aggressive.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The reaction of the termite Zootermopsis angusticollis (Hagen) toward distant chemical stimuli from biological and non-biological odors was classified into 2 categories: olfactory responses and common chemical reactions. The olfactory receptors were located on the antennae and the basiconic sensillae regarded as the specialized sites. The role of the palpi and the tracheal system in the mediation of the common chemical reaction was demonstrated. The sensitivity of the olfactory senses, assessed by measuring the reaction thresholds was found to be affected by increase of temperature and starvation.

TI SPECIES DIFFERENCES IN EFFECTS OF AN ANTICHOLINESTERASE ON ROCKING
   RESPONSE OF HEMILEUCINE MOTHS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In some species of hemileucine moths [Automeris spp., Hylesia nigricans] the number of side-to-side oscillations in a rocking response (rocking score) is raised by a factor of 2 or more after injections of physostigmine, while in others this effect is less prominent. These differences may reflect species variations in the excitability of the neural system mediating the response. The variability of rocking scores and the ease with which rocking can be evoked differ from species to species. The greater the variability of the score and the more easily the response is evoked, the larger is the increment induced by physostigmine. Evidence is provided that physostigmine can affect the rocking response of a species even though it does not normally raise the rocking score.

TI LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY IN DROSOPHILA .3. A DISTINCTION BETWEEN ACTIVITY AND

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to distinguish between changes in activity and reactivity in selectively bred strains of Drosophila melanogaster the response of active, inactive and control populations was measured over 25 successive min. in a circular runway. Fitting a regression equation of the form Y + A + b log10x showed that the rate of decrease in scoring was greater for both the experimental populations than for the control. The asymptotes of this decay did not overlap for any of the 3 populations. The results show an increase in reactivity in both experimental populations, but the similarity of the active and inactive strains indicated that the primary phenotypic difference between them is in terms of their level of spontaneous activity. The similarity is due to a decrease in the genetic variability of the experimental lines.

TI LEARNING AND RETENTION BY MONKEYS OF CONCURRENT CONDITIONAL
   DISCRIMINATION REVERSALS INVOLVING STIMULUS MANIPULATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Five macaque monkeys learned a concurrent series of 4 pairs of conditional shape discrimination reversals to a criterion of 90% correct over 40 trials. Problems were formed from 4 different shapes, organized arbitrarily into 2 categories with a right-left intercategory position relationship. Stimuli were presented 2 or 3 at a time; 1 or 2 serving as movable discriminanda and the other as a fixed cue or conditional sign. Four sets of transfer problems were then given, involving the introduction of new object shapes, one by one, into the basic problems, either as discriminanda or as cues. Positive transfer was significant when new objects were cues, but not when new objects were movable. Retention after 33 mo. was poor, but the appropriate motor skills rapidly returned during a single daily session.

TI MATING SUCCESS AND GENOTYPE FREQUENCY IN DROSOPHILA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The mating success of different strains of Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. paulistorum was studied in Elens-Wattiaux observation chambers. When 2 kinds of females and of males are present, the mating success depends upon their relative frequencies. The less frequent kind, especially of males, is more successful in mating. In D. pseudoobscura this is so when strains with different chromosomes, of different geographic origins, mutant v. wildtype flies, and flies raised at different temperatures are tested. The frequency effect is not observed with 2 sexually isolated strains of D. paulistorum. The mating advantage fostered by rarity may increase the genetic diversity on the population concerned.

AB Quantitative analyses of the social communication in 2 species of hermit crabs were carried out. Populations of the same species, Pagurus bonairensis, were studied in Curacao, North America, and Miami, Florida, and the social behavior patterns functioned similarity in the 2 areas. In addition, the communications process was studied in size-restricted groups of Clibabarius vittatus and the results compared with groups in which natural size variation was present. The amount of information transferred per visual display, the number of displays per aggressive interaction, and the information transferred per individual per interaction all increased when size variability of the interacting animals decreased.

TI A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONDITIONING AND COMMUNICATION IN HONEY BEES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB That simple discrimination conditioning, which is readily accomplished in the laboratory, is important in the foraging activity of a colony, especially with respect to communication, is suggested. Results of a conditioning experiment indicate the following virtually all bees conditioned to visit a given site continue to do so with reduced frequency after the feeding dish is empty; a renewed provision of sugar results in an immediate exponential increase in total number of bees visiting a dish in a manner suggestive of recruitment; efficiency of recruitment as a result of the dance maneuver appears to be very low; the exponential increase can occur without dancing by returning successful foragers. These results suggest that the colony exploited the experimental food source by some means other than by dance recruitment.

DT Article
AB Two closely related lines of White Rock chicks were compared at varying ages for development of fear responses. Half the birds of each line were held in isolation, and half in groups. All were tested individually for responses to a sudden loud noise. The lines differed significantly in their responsiveness to the bell, and line-method-of-rearing interactions were evident. Responsiveness increased, then declined to a plateau still well above the initial level with increasing age. These results are discussed in relation to 2 hypotheses on the nature of fear and its development.

TI INBREEDING AND SOCIAL DOMINANCE ABILITY IN CHICKENS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A composite sample of moderately inbred chickens from 5 lines was compared with the non-inbred base population for social dominance ability. Initial pair contests for males at 6 ages covering late adolescent and early adult stages of development indicated that lowered social dominance was associated with increased genetic homozygosity. Peck-order status of inbred females in 6 flocks assmbled at similar ages was also inveresely associated with coefficient of inbreeding. Inbred mles showed an upward trend in relative social status with age, but levelling off occurred well below the 50 per cent level. Such an age associated trend was not observed in inbred females. Sexual maturity of males as indicated by age at first semen production was not associated with social dominance ability when social competition effects were minimized.

DT Article
AB Ten food-deprived rats and 10 non-deprived rats were observed for 15 mln. each in an exploration box allowing free choice between novel and familiar units. Although all subjects showed a preference for novelty, there were no significant differences in these preferences between the 2 groups as measured by the number of 10-sec. periods spent in the novel half of the box and by the percentage of novel units entered. However, the food-deprived rats entered a significantly greater total number of units. It was concluded that, contrary to earlier studie, food deprivation had not affected exploration of novelty but had possibly influenced activity of some origin other than strict exploratory tendencies.

TI RUTTING BEHAVIOUR IN A BARREN-GROUND CARIBOU POPULATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Among the barren-ground caribou of northwest Alaska, migratory behavior was observed to continue throughout the breeding season. A peak of rutting activity occurred during the 3rd week of Oct. in both 1960 and 1961. In contrast to non-migratory populations of Rangifer tarandus, there were no harems formed. Social groups were open and usually contained several mature males. Rutting activities of mature males are divisable into 2 phases: the preliminary, in which the male appears to test the estrous state of females, and the tending phase in which the male follows closely and defends a single cow. During both phases bulls directed towards cows a modified threat posture called the "threat-display".

TI EFFECTS OF SENSORY DEPRIVATION LEVEL VISUAL COMPLEXITY AND AGE UPON
   LIGHT CONTINGENT RESPONSES DURING REARING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rats were reared and tested for 44 days after eye-opening under different light levels, complexity, light intensity, and opportunity for producing light change. Lever pressing frequency was greater for light than for dark reared animals. Rearing condition interaction revealed that light onset from darkness increased responses producing a change from homogeneous to heterogeneous visual stimulation, but depressed responses producing a change from darkness to homogeneous lighted stimulation. With light offset, a change from homogeneous stimulation to darkness increased responses, while a change from heterogeneous stimulation to darkness depressed responding. One conclusion suggests that light deprivation decreases the degree of visual stimulus change from adapation level acceptable to the organism. Responding increased steeply with age in most conditions. A decrease and subsequent increase in the age function suggests the operation of a "sensitive" period in rat development, whose onset is driven by degree of sensory input and differs with sex.

AB The study reports observations on 21 lambings from Masham and Clun Forest ewes. Photographic evidence is offered for an instinctive response by the lamb to place its head under any projecting surface at about the height of its own shoulder and initiate the bunting and tail-wagging movements associated with suckling. The licking of the new born lamb accompanied by low pitched "maa-ing;" by the ewe, appear to be instinctive. The possibility of very rapid learning during an especially sensitive period, or''imprinting'' by the ewe on the olfactory and vocal characteristics of the lamb and by the lamb on the vocal characteristics of the ewe, is advanced.

AB Certain patterns (components of waltz display, cloacal lowering copulation) directed by domestic chicks to the imprinting object after treatment with testosterone appear to be quite new. Others (pecking, seeking bodily contact, mounting) are increased in frequency and exaggerated in form by the hormone but appear in their new contexts still to correspond basically in causation and form to responses given by the normal chick during imprinting. This may be one of the processes whereby the elicltation of adult responses is affected by imprinting. A similar situation exists in the guinea pig.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB With light as the UCS (unconditioned stimulus), groups of warm (23O-25[degree]C) and cold (10[degree]-12[degree]C) earthworms were conditioned to perform a withdrawal response to a vibratory CS (conditioned stimulus). Both warm and cold conditioning groups evidenced increments over the 50 conditioning trials. The increase for the warm group was significant (p< .01) while that for the cold group was not, suggesting that redution in responsiveness results from lowered body temperature. Neither the cold nor the warm sen-sitization or pseudoconditioning control groups gave evidence of increased responsiveness. After the cold conditioning group had warmed to room temperature, the 2 conditioning groups did not differ in the number of responses given in extinction. These results are discussed in terms of the effects of reduced body temperature on conditioning and on neural transmission.

AB Groups of tropical fish (Acquidens latifrons) were given discrimination training on outline triangles and circles with the triangle as the positive stimulus. The response was to "nosebang" the preferred shape. The shapes were suspended in the home tank and the activity of the fish was not constrained. After attaining the criterion of 80% correct over 10 successive days, unrewarded generalization trials using a pair comparison method were given using modified or different, rotated or unrotated shapes. Response tendencies were determined by similarities to parts of the training shapes, although the parts used seemed to differ as a function of the testing stimuli. Rotations through 180 degrees almost completely reduced any earlier observed response control. The findings suggested difficulties for several theories of shape perception.

AB When navigating homewards, central-place foragers can use landmarks and sun angle to adjust their return movement behaviour. However, for tropical oceanic species foraging from low-lying atolls, the effectiveness of their homing journeys on their time returns remains unclear. Thus, in this study, the navigation behaviour of red-footed boobies, Sula sula rubripes, in the Chagos Archipelago, central Indian Ocean, was investigated. Using GPS tracking data from 207 breeding adults across four colonies, the homing duration, bearing and trajectory straightness during central-place foraging were explored to elucidate the navigational constraints and temporal dynamics. Return distances and orientations were modelled in relation to the time of day and distance to the colony to assess whether birds adjust their homing behaviour to return before dusk. We found that red-footed boobies navigated efficiently back to their colony on fast, straight and direct flights and adjusted their homing behaviour to arrive at the colony around dusk: the closer to the evening twilight they start their homing journey, the shorter, faster and more direct their routes become. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of seabird navigation in tropical environments, as well as insights into the adaptive mechanism underlying successful navigation over expansive oceanic territories.

AB The study of personality in animals requires methods for quantifying consistent among-individual differences in behaviour. Typically, standardized behavioural assays are used rather than in situ tools. We evaluated whether assays and accelerometry, a relatively novel method of quantifying animal behaviour in the field, yielded similar personality measurements in a wild population of North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, by comparing among-individual correlations of behaviours across these methods. Both methods described two behavioural axes, with assays capturing activity and exploration, and accelerometry capturing foraging and movement. We found higher trait repeatability (R) for traits measured with assays (Radj: adults: 0.37-0.40; yearlings: 0.18-0.48) than for traits measured with accelerometry (Radj: adults 0.11-0.19; yearlings: 0.07-0.11). Additionally, we found a significant positive among-individual correlation between the assay behavioural axis associated with exploration and the accelerometry behavioural axis associated with foraging. We also found that the repeatability of traits measured with accelerometry was related to the amount of behavioural data captured by this method. Given that accelerometry was able to quantify animal personality in situ for adults, accelerometer collars may present a possible alternative to assays for species in which assays are impractical. Our results also underscore the importance of considering the amount of behavioural data captured by different methods when assessing trait repeatability. As researchers strive to measure behavioural variation under natural conditions, sufficient behavioural sampling remains a priority. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Mosquito-borne pathogens continue to pose a significant health threat worldwide. Efforts to combat mosquito-borne diseases mainly focus on the elimination of either adult mosquitoes or their breeding habitats. A comprehensive understanding of larval physiology and behaviour, particularly in response to light and temperature conditions, might advance the efforts of breeding habitat elimination. This study aimed to investigate the behavioural responses of mosquito larvae to temperature, light and the interaction between these two. The research was performed with Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae, which were tracked for 31 min with an infrared camera in water-filled aluminium trays that were subjected to different temperature and lighting conditions. The larvae exhibited a preference for cooler temperatures in all three gradients (10-20 degrees C, 20-30 degrees C, 30-40 degrees C) under light conditions, aligning with the behaviour of adult mosquitoes. This preference is believed to be an adaptive response to avoid heat stress in their natural breeding habitats. However, in the 20-30 degrees C gradient without light, the larvae displayed a more even distribution around the point of release. Furthermore, when both temperature and light gradients were present, the larvae initially (until minute 15) demonstrated negative phototaxis. Only later (after 15 min) did they prefer the cooler side. This suggests that Ae. aegypti larvae eventually prioritize thermotaxis. Movement analysis revealed that larval velocity was higher at the initial release site and at higher temperatures. Intriguingly, the larvae were more active during the dark phase, possibly to enhance their exploration and foraging abilities when visual predators are less active. These results highlight the complex interplay of the environmental cues temperature and light in shaping the behaviour of mosquito larvae. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity especially because of their influence on native species. Their behaviours, including those in nonsocial contexts, significantly influence species fitness, drive invasion processes and can result in the competitive exclusion of less dominant species. Understanding these behavioural patterns is vital for the protection of native species and the control of invasive species spread. There is still a controversy regarding the success of invasive species, whether it is attributed to inherent behavioural traits or to adaptations to new environments. This study focused on native populations of two sympatric lizard species in Croatia: a lizard known for its invasiveness, Podarcis siculus, and the eastern Adriatic endemic Podarcis melisellensis. We evaluated nonsocial behaviour associated with competition, including food consumption, exploratory behaviour and risk-taking behaviours, using two primary apparatuses: an open field and a radial maze. Podarcis siculus exhibited higher levels of exploratory behaviour, reduced risk-taking behaviours and greater food consumption than P. melisellensis. These behavioural traits are consistent with behaviour observed in invasive populations of P. siculus, suggesting that they may be intrinsic to the species. Our results indicate that a successful invader is more likely to explore and at the same time be more cautious. Research on behavioural traits in native populations sheds light on preadaptive features of invasive species that could characterize a successful invader, highlighting the importance of researching invasive species in their native range.

AB Hatching asynchrony is understood as a female tactic that shapes family dynamics, but its adjustment mechanisms and adaptiveness remain unclear. Using 32 years of individual data on a Neotropical seabird, the blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii, we examined variation in hatching asynchrony in relation to sea surface temperature, a proxy for food abundance, and hatching asynchrony's adaptiveness. Under warm sea surface temperature, signalling low food abundance, females extended laying interval, resulting in increased hatching asynchrony. Longer hatching asynchrony was associated with more probable and earlier brood reduction. When brood reduction occurred, longer hatching asynchrony improved females' prospect of breeding the next year but not their timing of laying or production of fledglings and recruits. By extending laying interval, female boobies increase hatching asynchrony to cope with poor food conditions by prompting early brood reduction, thereby reducing reproductive costs and enhancing the probability of breeding the next year. Understanding the temperature sensitivity of plastic reproductive traits is crucial for predicting organisms' responses and resilience to global warming. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB In internally fertilizing species, an individual's mating history (whether they have previously participated in a successful mating interaction) can influence a range of mating behaviours. For example, mating often leads to a reduction in how responsive individuals are to future mating opportunities, especially for females. This fits the prediction of sexual selection theory that unmated individuals should be highly responsive to sexual stimuli to ensure a mating. This has led many researchers to prefer to use only unmated females in mating experiments, to maximize the likelihood that females will respond to sexual stimuli. However, other studies show contrasting results, and this effect has not yet been quantified formally. There is also some evidence that males of some species become less responsive after mating. This means it is unclear how general this behavioural change is, whether it occurs in both sexes, or whether it differs across taxonomic groups. I present a formal meta-analysis of 41 studies and 38 animal (mostly arthropod) species, which confirmed that female responsiveness to future mating opportunities is significantly reduced after mating. However, I found no consistent evidence for such an effect in males. This may be due to the greater mating potential of males compared to females, meaning that males typically benefit from further matings while females do not. I also collate evidence suggesting that most mating experiments probably exclusively use only unmated females. I use this evidence to consider how male and female mating history should influence how we design mating experiments. (c) 2024 The Author.

AB Noise from human activity is a global concern that threatens wildlife, including by disrupting acoustic communication. This disruption is often assumed to be caused by masking, where signals are difficult to hear in the presence of noise of similar frequency to the signals. However, other mechanisms can also lead to reduced responses to signals: animals may be distracted by noise and so miss the signal, or noise may increase their vigilance and so lead them to use personal information instead of responding to signals from others. Previous experimental work on superb fairy-wrens, Malurus cyaneus, found evidence that masking disrupted responses to conspecific alarm calls but could not rule out distraction. We therefore designed experiments using responses to heterospecific alarm calls to distinguish masking from distraction. We tested responses to low- and high-frequency heterospecific alarm calls during lowand high-frequency noise. Fairy-wrens responded to both heterospecific alarm calls during nonoverlapping noise, but not during overlapping noise, regardless of noise frequency, and vigilance was similar during the two types of noise. We conclude that the alarm call response was compromised by masking, not distraction or increased vigilance. Overall, the assessment of mechanisms helps predict the consequences of noise pollution and provides suggestions on managing anthropogenic noise at the community level, such as avoiding noise whose frequency overlaps either conspecific or heterospecific calls.

AB Recreational activities often result in a spatial and/or temporal activity shift in wildlife. With the concurrent development of outdoor activities and increase in temperatures due to climate change, mountain species face increasing pressures in terms of managing their activity pattern to limit both risk exposure and thermal discomfort. Using more than 15 years of long-term GPS and activity sensor data, we investigated how female northern chamois, Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra , adjust their summer circadian activity to spatiotemporal variation in both temperatures and hikers ' presence. Chamois' behaviour was more affected by high temperatures than by hikers ' presence. During the hottest days, they shifted their activity peak earlier in the morning, were more active at night and during activity peaks, less active during daytime and had longer morning and evening peaks compared to the coldest days. Yet, total daily activity was only slightly different during the hottest days compared to the coldest days. Conversely, hikers' disturbance had weak effects on activity levels and on the timing of activity peaks. This is especially true for temporal disturbance (weekdays versus weekends and public holidays), possibly because most weekdays in summer fell during school holidays. Only during the hottest conditions, the morning activity peak was shorter and the evening peak longer in females living in the most exposed areas compared to females living in the least exposed areas. One possible explanation for the overall low effect of hikers' disturbance may be that behavioural changes buffering animals from high temperatures and hikers' presence (e.g. moving away from trails) allow them to just marginally modify their activity pattern. In the context of ongoing socioenvironmental changes, it is critical to conserve habitats providing thermal refuges against summer heat and protection from disturbance to mitigate potential detrimental consequences.

AB Social living provides benefits to group members, but these benefits come at a cost. In fissionefusion societies, individuals or small groups leave and join different groups as ecological constraints on group size fluctuate. Little research has been conducted on how human disturbance influences fission efusion groups after accounting for ecological conditions. As a large, wide-ranging species with large resource needs facing increasing human disturbance (e.g. poaching and habitat loss), African forest elephants, Loxodonta cyclotis, provide unique insight into how environmental, social and anthropogenic factors influence group size. We reconstructed forest elephant social groups using noninvasive genetic samples extracted from elephant dung collected while tracking GPS-collared forest elephants. Through a novel application of hierarchical markerecapture models, we estimated group size and the anthropogenic, demographic and environmental factors associated with fluctuations in group size. We found that high fruit availability was associated with a decrease in group size and that human disturbance (measured as an index of the global human footprint) was associated with an increase in group size, but to a lesser degree. Understanding social group dynamics is important for ensuring effective population management of forest elephants, both for tracking when large groups might be at risk from poaching and preventing the negative health associations of suboptimal group sizes such as increased stress and decreased reproduction. Additionally, our integration of genotyping, satellite remote sensing and statistical methods can inform the study of forest elephants and other cryptic species into the future.

AB Behavioural plasticity may require energetically expensive sensory and neural adaptations to detect, process and respond to social cues. These costs could lead to selection against behavioural plasticity and its eventual loss. We found that males from the behaviourally plastic alternative reproductive tactic (ART) in the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus had relatively larger brains, in addition to a trade-off with testes size, that was not detected in the males from the behaviourally fixed ART. Given these costs, we consider the hypothesis that plasticity in mating behaviours is maintained due to intralocus tactical conflict, where a shared genome can constrain one or both ARTs from evolving to their optima. When we reduced any potential for intralocus tactical conflict by removing the behaviourally fixed ART from longterm breeding mesocosms, males from the behaviourally plastic ART were less plastic and had smaller brains compared to their counterparts from control mesocosms (both male ARTs). We also detected evidence for a genetic correlation between the ARTs for behaviour, which is required for intralocus conflict. Our findings suggest that intralocus tactical conflict could be maintaining behavioural plasticity, in which case behavioural plasticity may not be adaptative in some cases.& COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Competition for acoustic space is key for sound-communicating animals, yet little is known about whether and how it may drive evolutionary pathways, for example signal structure, as well as species distributions or individual spatial behaviour. Here we assessed the occurrence of interspecific acoustic competition in sound-communicating taxa by testing three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses explaining variability of song structure and singing activity, in two sibling species of tree crickets of the genus Oecanthus. By comparing song acoustic parameters, diel activity patterns and relative densities of singing crickets in both sympatry and allopatry, we found that the local co-occurrence of the two species drives changes in all the considered factors of song production. Namely, we report changes in temporal and structural song traits, as well as in singing activity patterns and apparent population density, with strongly asymmetrical effects, only evident for one of the two species considered. Our results highlight the role of acoustic space as a key resource that shapes biotic interactions, and eventually behaviours, in sound-communicating taxa, and represent a replicable approach in the study of acoustic assemblages. & COPY; 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Optimal foraging theory has guided much of the research on foraging behaviour in the past five decades, with the notion of optimality deeply embedded in most models today. However, assuming that all for-agers strive to maximize a certain predefined currency, such as amount of food per unit time, restricts what can be learned about the factors influencing foraging decisions. Here we applied a different approach: the discrete-choice model, which does not assume an optimal strategy as the starting point, but instead examines foraging decisions directly, modelling interpatch movements as the consequence of a choice of destination from a limited set of options. We analysed a set of foraging decisions by both adult male and female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, from two habituated communities in the Budongo forest, Uganda, to investigate the influence of foraging variables including food patch characteristics and interpatch distance on patch choice, with a view to identifying the strategy underlying these decisions. Despite differences in habitat between communities, we found that foraging strategies were remarkably similar across both communities and sexes, with chimpanzees exhibiting a clear preference for closer and novel (not previously visited) food patches. Individuals of both communities frequently chose to forage on food patches providing young leaves, highlighting the importance of this food type in their diet.Contrary to expectation, patch size did not predict foraging decisions, except for adult males of one community that chose larger patches, while both sexes aimed to minimize travel distance between consecutive patches. This study provides the first direct evidence that chimpanzees consider travel distance and whether they have recently visited a patch when choosing between potential foraging sites and demonstrates that new insights can be gained (even in a well-studied system) from integrating several important variables describing feeding ecology into a coherent model of patch choice.

The life-history trade-off between current and future reproduction, combined with individual variation in age or condition and therefore in residual repro-ductive value, may explain this apparent paradox. Specifically, individuals that are old or of low condition and therefore of low residual reproductive value should take risks and thus elevate current reproduction at the expense of future reproduction. The opposite should be true for individuals that are young or of high condition and therefore of high residual reproductive value, which should be risk averse. Over the course of a long-term study on Lincoln's sparrows, Melospiza lincolnii, we discovered a behavioural phenotype based on trappability that predicts both condition (but not age) and current reproductive success but, surprisingly, in a way that was not expected based on our assumption of how this phenotype is associated with risk taking. We found that, relative to individuals that did not enter traps (the nontrap phenotype, assumed as risk averse), those of the trap phenotype (assumed as risk taking) showed elevated indices of energetic condition and, for females, reduced reproductive success. Assortative mating may be a proximate mechanism for the populationwide maintenance of multiple behavioural phenotypes, and we found that assortative pairings based on trappability phenotype occurred more frequently than random pairing would predict. However, assortative pairing, when compared to dis-assortative pairing, did not affect reproductive success. Nevertheless, the contrasting relationships be-tween current reproductive success and condition that we found for each phenotype are consistent with life-history theory. However, our results are not consistent with the assumption that the trap phenotype is a manifestation of risk-taking behaviour and may, in fact, arise from just the opposite: a risk-averse, shy or neophobic behaviour for the trap phenotype.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal groups regularly lose group members as a result of death and dispersal, but the consequences of such a loss on the social relationships among the remaining group members remain generally under-studied. Moreover, some of the few studies on this topic reported destabilizing effects of group member loss in some species, whereas in other species individuals apparently compensated for lost partners by strengthening remaining relationships. However, it remains unknown what may drive these contrasting effects in different species. Here, we investigated the impact of the loss of an individual on subsequent social patterns in a basal group-living primate, the redfronted lemur. Using focal animal observation data surrounding 16 disappearance events (five dispersals and 11 predation events) in four groups of wild redfronted lemurs, we tested for changes in the coefficient of variation of relationship strength in affiliative interaction networks, as well as for changes in affiliative and agonistic interaction rates. We found no evidence for significant changes in any of the three measures, indicating that the disappearance of a group member is not reflected by a change in social interactions among redfronted lemurs. Yet, the fact that rates of social interactions did not change significantly indicates that they compensated for the loss of a group member by redistributing their social behaviour towards other individuals. Our study therefore indicates that redfronted lemurs' social interactions are resilient to group member loss. Alternatively, the number of unpredictable disappearance events in our retrospective study may have been too small to detect any effects, underscoring the need for additional comparative research on this topic to determine whether methodological constraints or particular coping mechanisms underly this apparent contrast with anthropoid primates.

AB Accessory gland proteins contained within male ejaculates influence female reproduction and survival in insects. Nuptial food gifts offered by male crickets and katydids, the consumption of which may also alter female behaviour and physiology after mating, also contain accessory gland proteins. However, because nuptial feeding promotes the transfer of sperm and ejaculatory substances, it is unclear whether it is accessory gland proteins in the ejaculate, nuptial gifts or both that mediate these effects. Here we evaluate the effects of mating, nuptial gifts and accessory gland proteins on female reproduction in a gift -giving cricket (Gryllodes sigillatus) using a crossed experimental design. We injected females of varying mating experience with male accessory gland extract, permitting some females to consume the nuptial food gift, while experimentally preventing others from doing so. Mating resulted in a significant decrease in female sexual receptivity, an effect likely mediated by accessory gland proteins contained in the male's ejaculate. Consumption of the nuptial food gift resulted in the premature cessation of nuptial feeding following the female's next mating, leading to a concomitant decrease in sperm transfer by a rival male. This is a novel finding, demonstrating that fitness benefits to males of nuptial gift provisioning can also accrue over later copulations by their mates. Neither injection of accessory gland extract nor nuptial feeding influenced female oviposition; the absence of any effect of the injection of accessory gland proteins on female reproduction suggests that their efficacy may depend on their direct introduction into the female reproductive tract. More research is required to identify the specific accessory gland proteins in ejaculates and nuptial gifts that modulate female behaviour and physiology, potentially illuminating the evolution of these mechanistic tactics underlying sexual conflict.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Inhibitory control requires an individual to suppress impulsive actions in favour of more appropriate behaviours to gain a delayed reward. It plays an important role in activities such as foraging and initiating mating, but high within-species variation suggests that some individuals have greater inhibitory control than others. A standard index of inhibitory control used in many taxa is measuring how long an animal persists in trying to move itself or an appendage (e.g. its hand) through a transparent barrier to reach a reward. Although recent nonhuman studies have investigated how different factors are associated with variation in inhibitory control, these studies have rarely considered how these factors interact. Here we investigated how sex, age, personality (boldness) and the type of reward stimulus interact to predict the degree of motor inhibitory control in eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki. We measured inhibitory control using a standard detour assay, 'boldness' (time to emergence in a novel environment), and the rate of learning. There were three different reward stimuli: a shoal of females, a shoal of males or a mixed-sex shoal. Individuals were tested in four consecutive trials, always with the same reward type, to quantify short-term learning. These measures were repeated at 7,14 and 21 weeks after maturation to examine the effect of age. Females had significantly greater inhibitory control than males. Regardless of sex, older fish had significantly greater inhibitory control than younger fish, and boldness predicted learning ability. The type of reward stimuli had no sex-specific effect on inhibitory control. We discuss the biological significance of these sources of variation in inhibitory control, and the importance of accounting for them in studies examining individual differences in cognitive abilities.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many animal species use vocal and nonvocal acoustic signals to communicate over large distances. Wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, drum on the buttress roots of trees, generating low-frequency sounds that can reach distances of over 1 km. Buttress drumming is produced in bouts of beats and is often accompanied by pant hoots, the species-typical long-distance vocalization. We investigated whether individual differences exist in the acoustic structure of drumming bouts produced by male chimpanzees of the Waibira community in the Budongo Forest in Uganda, and whether individual, contextual and social factors affected their use of drumming. We found individual differences in drumming bouts produced by seven male chimpanzees during travel events as well as in their timing within the pant hoot, and discriminated specific patterns of beats for some chimpanzees. In contrast, we found no evi-dence for individual differences in the acoustic structure of drumming bouts produced by four males during displays. Together these findings suggest that chimpanzees may be able to choose to encode identity within individual drumming 'signatures'. Chimpanzees drummed less frequently as their party size increased. We found no evidence that the age of the signaller or the presence of preferred social partners, higher-ranking males or females in oestrus affected the use of drumming. These findings suggest there may be flexibility in buttress drumming across social and behavioural contexts and provide support for the hypothesis that, by encoding individual identity, long-distance drumming may be used to facilitate chimpanzee fission-fusion social dynamics.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Task specialization is a hallmark of social success as it can minimize among-individual conflict in task participation, and thereby optimize colony productivity. Task specialization is therefore predicted to manifest as a consequence of social evolution. While age or caste in some species explains task partic-ipation, a recent hypothesis states that personality type determines differential task participation and thereby facilitates specialization. The social spider Stegodyphus sarasinorum exhibits no castes or con-spicuous dominance hierarchies or age polyethism yet shows consistent among-individual differences in prey capture. We tested whether one personality trait (boldness) determines task specialization by exploring the determinants causing consistent participation in prey attack. By integrating a personality type and individual hunger, we tested two mutually exclusive hypotheses. (1) Among-individual dif-ferences in personality determine consistent differences in participation in prey capture, leading to specialization. (2) Individuals are flexible, and individual hunger state determines the propensity to capture prey. We found that hunger state was the only significant determinant of attacking prey. By reversing individual hunger state, we were able to dramatically increase or decrease individual attack propensities. Spiders exhibited consistent among-individual differences in boldness, yet this personality type did not predict foraging participation. Therefore, we found no evidence for behavioural speciali-zation in prey capture. Our study emphasizes the importance of internal state as a mechanism underlying variable task participation, suggesting caution in attributing behavioural specialization to personality without appropriate integration of state-dependent effects.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Social media platforms, such as Twitter, provide the opportunity for academics to network and to disseminate research to colleagues and the general public. More recently, Twitter in particular has become a platform for hosting academic conferences in addition to or as an alternative to either traditional in-person academic conferences or virtual conferences, now typical since the onset of COVID. The Animal Behavior Society (ABS) and the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour (ASAB) hosted their first global Animal Behaviour Twitter Conference in January 2021, in which researchers in animal behaviour from around the world shared recent work with fellow academics. Here, we explore the impact of the first global Animal Behaviour Twitter Conference (#AnimBehav2021) using questionnaires and Web site analytics to assess the dissemination of research and networking opportunities the event provided. Ultimately, this Animal Behaviour Twitter Conference increased the global reach and the accessibility of communicating animal behaviour research in comparison to in-person events. Furthermore, we use this case study to describe the logistics of organizing a Twitter conference in the field of animal behaviour, the novel opportunities this conference brought along and how other academic societies in behavioural biology can adapt our approach and benefit from this conference format.

AB Acoustic signals in animals serve to convey context-dependent information to receivers. Birds and mammals combine diverse sounds into complex sequences to communicate, but the role of temporal sequencing of signals remains understudied in other taxa. Anuran vocalizations are a prominent feature of their life history, and function in defence of territories and to attract mates. However, there are few data on whether anurans pattern their calls into sequences, and whether temporal sequences convey information about context. Here, we investigated the context-dependent vocal repertoire and the use of vocal sequences by two anuran species belonging to different lineages, comparing frogs vocalizing alone and in the presence of a territorial rival. Using a robust analytical framework, we present evidence that both species modify their vocal sequence structure according to context. Specifically, one species (with a smaller repertoire, from a more basal lineage) appends notes to generate more complex sequences, whereas the other (more recently diverged and with a larger repertoire) shifts to different note types, resulting in different sequences for different contexts. Thus, despite differences in repertoire size, both frog species are capable of adjusting the temporal sequence of vocalizations to communicate in different contexts. Vocal sequences and context-dependent 'syntax' may be more common in anurans than previously thought, and our methodology presents a paradigm to study the evolution and function of these complex vocal patterns.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Although studies on primate communication have mainly focused on single communication systems (gestural, facial or vocal), there is an increasing interest in a more integrative approach to describe the communication of our closest relatives, particularly with the aim of investigating the evolutionary roots of human language. The understanding of the ultimate functions of multimodal (involving signals of different sensory modalities) and multicomponent (association of different signal types) communication needs more systematic description of multiple signal use in primate species, with details on the circumstances leading to such complex signalling. In the present study, we describe the sequential use of communicative signals of different types and sensory modalities in a captive population of catarrhine monkeys, the red-capped mangabey, Cercocebus torquatus. We applied existing analysis methods from other disciplines to define, systematically describe and quantify the production of signals among communicative sequences. We notably used sequence analysis tools (based on dissimilarity measures) to identify the typical signal sequences produced by mangabeys, and network analysis to describe dyadic signal associations among these sequences. The focal observation of five social groups of mangabeys allowed us to identify 424 communicative sequences, which could be grouped into eight main categories, and whose complexity, multimodality and multicomponentiality depended on social context and signaller characteristics. Overall, captive mangabeys frequently associated communication signals of all types (body, facial and vocal signals) and modalities (visual, audible and tactile), in a flexible way. Our results complete previous description of red-capped mangabey signalling and highlight the need for a multimodal and multicomponent approach to understand the complexity of primate communication. Moreover, we propose the method we used as a way to enhance primate communication analysis, in the frame of comparative research. (c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Foraging site selection and site fidelity can have implications for many ecological processes. The degree of site fidelity differs greatly not just between species but also within populations. Some of this variation may be explained by a win-stay-lose-shift (WSLS) strategy, where an individual returns to its most recent foraging area only if the previous visit was profitable. However, the use and adaptive value of this strategy have mostly been tested in captivity, largely because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate measures of profitability (foraging efficiency) in the wild. Here, we used a rare combination of data on movements of breeding black-browed albatrosses, Thalassarche melanophris, tracked using satellite transmitters, and on chick meal mass obtained from automatic nest balances, to test whether individuals adopted a WSLS strategy, and how this strategy performed in terms of provisioning rate. We found results consistent with the use of a WSLS strategy, and that the strategy had some adaptive value, albeit rather limited. Our observational study of free-living seabirds corroborates previous experimental results suggesting that animals account for recent foraging success in their decision making and can adapt their strategy to local resource dynamics.

AB Associations between escape behaviours of birds approached by humans and life history traits differ between continents. This suggests environment and history have shaped the evolution of escape at the continental scale. We compared the escape behaviour of birds between eastern Australia (relatively low density and shorter history of human presence) and eastern Africa (high density and substantially longer history of human presence), in relation to life and natural history traits known to influence escape behaviour. We examined associations between flight initiation distance (FID) and life and natural history variables, using phylogenetically controlled analysis and model selection procedures, for 9372 FIDs from 516 bird species. Overall, African birds had shorter FIDs than Australian birds; however, this difference was only observed among nonmigratory (resident) species. Migratory birds showed no continental level differences in FIDs. Across continents, birds in 'wetland' and 'treed' habitats both had significantly longer FIDs than birds in 'scrub' habitats. Diet and social traits (cooperative breeding and flocking) did not significantly influence FID. The relationship between body mass and FID was positive for Australian birds but not so for African birds. This study (1) suggests that resident eastern African birds are more tolerant of humans and (2) supports the contention that some principles regarding escape behaviour of birds might represent universal patterns (e.g. longer FIDs in open wetland habitats), others (e.g. longer FIDs in larger birds) vary geographically or with habituation, perhaps in relation to the history of cohabitation between humans (and other predators) and birds.

AB Reproductive behaviour is often targeted by behavioural parasitism due to its high energy costs and direct relationship with fitness. Courtship behaviour represents a substantial amount of the investment in reproduction, as it usually requires conspicuous movements that are energetically demanding and increase predation risk. Here, we present an alternative reproductive tactic in which dominant male sailfin tetra, Crenuchus spilurus Gunther 1863, parasitize the courtship behaviour of subordinate males. By conducting field observations and controlled experiments in laboratory, we show that, under low availability of nesting sites, dominant males favour a close-range defence of nesting sites, while subordinate males invest more in courtship activities. However, subordinate males often directed courtship movements towards a nesting site dominated by a concealed dominant male, who subsequently took over the female and resumed courtship. Our laboratory experiment also showed that only dominant males obtained spawning success regardless of the amount of effort allocated to courtship behaviour, circumventing the initial female preference for the subordinate male. Subordinate males were more likely to initiate contests and ceased courtship upon losing aggressive contests. In such instances, the courtship effort of dominant males was higher, suggesting that dominant males modulate their courtship effort according to the effort of subordinate males. We refer to this tactic as courtship piracy. For being dependent on resource defence, the effectiveness of courtship piracy is contingent on the defendability of nesting sites. In a follow-up experiment, we show that dominant males invest more in nesting site defence only when nesting sites are scarce. Since rainfall controls the amount of nesting sites in the natural habitat, we suggest that seasonality modulates the relative contribution of courtship piracy and female mate choice to reproductive success.

AB Following the introduction of DNA fingerprinting in the 1980s, studies have repeatedly revealed mismatches between the mating system inferred from social behaviour and the mating system revealed through genetic relationships. In this study, we examined the occurrence of extragroup paternities (EGPs) in gelada monkeys at Guassa, Ethiopia and explored how EGPs may be acquired in this species, which is conventionally considered to have a single breeding male ("leader") per social group ("unit"). We found that while leaders sired most offspring, a substantial proportion (17 of 88 offspring, 19%) were sired by extra-unit males. Offspring were more likely to be sired by extra-unit males when they were: (1) conceived in the 6 months following the start of peak rainfall (July-December) and (2) the first successful conception for a mother. Furthermore, eight of the 17 extra-unit paternities were directly or indirectly the result of a single infertile leader, indicating that infertility plays an important role in the occurrence of EGPs. Compiling published data revealed that the 19% EGP rate observed among Guassa geladas was also the median for polygynous nonhuman primates (range 0-57%, N = 5 populations), in contrast to geladas in the Simien Mountains, where EGPs are absent or rare. Thus, intraspecific variation in EGP rates in geladas encompasses much of the range described across polygynous primates more broadly. The Guassa gelada EGP rate was similar to the median rate reported for mammals. Primates generally had a lower median rate of EGPs, more similar to the median rate reported for birds. Understanding variation in EGP rates requires understanding the outcomes of competing interests of males and females within the same species, as well as how these features contribute to the evolution of social systems and influence variation in EGP rates at higher taxonomic levels.

AB Adapting to environmental change is a major challenge faced by animals and the role of individual behavioural differences in facilitating this process is currently the focus of much research. Innovation, the generation of a novel behaviour or use of a known behaviour in a novel context, is one form of behaviour that enables animals to respond to change. By deciphering the mechanisms underlying innovativeness, especially those that explain consistent differences between individuals, we can further understand the consequences of this behavioural variation. We tested whether motivation, experience, inhibitory control and personality were linked to different stages of sequential innovative problem-solving performance among great tits, Parus major, and of their overall innovativeness across tasks. We gave animals originating from lines bidirectionally selected for fast or slow early exploratory behaviour, a multiaccess problem-solving device. Diverse motor skills and behavioural flexibility were required to solve all three different access points sequentially over trials. Food-deprived, highly motivated birds had shorter latency to touch the device, were more likely to solve an access point within a trial, and solved a greater diversity of them, than their less motivated counterparts. Solving success increased with accuracy when interacting with the device (proportion of touches to functional components of the device compared to all touches to the device per trial), and with previous experience. Personality selection lines and inhibitory control had little effect. Repeatability analysis showed that between-individual differences in problem solving performance were explained by: (1) pseudorepeatable effects (upward bias) linked to hunger induced motivation, (2) repeatable differences in accuracy when interacting with devices, and (3) a feedback loop caused by experience gained over successive trials. Our results highlight the challenges of characterizing consistent individual differences in behaviour generally and support the idea that complex sources of variation play an important role in problem-solving performance.

AB Identifying interaction partners, a particularly challenging task in the absence of an explicit communication system (e.g. vocalization), is key to understanding how information is distributed and processed within animal groups. Moreover, the interaction network regulates complex collective behaviours such as collective motion and predator detection. Despite the relevance of the interaction network, only a few experiments have been designed to decipher it. Moreover, the mechanism by which an individual selects its interaction neighbours remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the interaction neighbour selection process, by studying the behavioural response of na?ve group members confronted with the controlled departure of a trained individual in herds of merino sheep, Ovis aries. By identifying the first individual that followed the trained individual, we inferred the probability of a group member choosing it as its interaction neighbour, assuming that this probability is modulated by either the relative distance, the relative distance rank or a combination of both. The underlying interaction network was constructed from this probability. The results provide unique, reliable information on the functional form of this probability, and thus on the interaction network and on how individuals interact within groups. The suggested method of working out the selection process can be easily implemented in other animal systems and contexts. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Glucocorticoids (GCs) regulate metabolism and energy balance by mediating physiological and behav-ioural responses to stress. Vertebrates respond to environmental challenges by increasing GC levels, which mediate the reallocation of resources from delayable activities such as reproduction to immediate survival necessities. However, when future reproductive potential is low, it has been hypothesized (and evidenced in a few semelparous species) that stress should adaptively promote reproduction rather than suppress it, even at the expense of wellbeing. Due to their unique life cycle and particular habitat, annual fishes (Cyprinodontiformes, Aplocheiloidei) are ideal unexplored model systems to test the prediction that GCs promote reproduction. Annual fishes are among the most remarkable extremophile species with the shortest vertebrate life span. They inhabit ephemeral ponds, and after reaching sexual maturity in few weeks, they breed continuously. As the breeding season progresses, and pond dry-out is immi-nent, future mating opportunities decrease together with the impoverishment of environmental con-ditions. In this study, we evaluate, for the first time in annual fishes, how reproduction is affected by high GC levels. We first show that male Austrolebias reicherti increase their cortisol levels as the breeding season progresses and environmental conditions deteriorate in the wild. Furthermore, increased cortisol levels in males were associated with increases in female gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic (HSI) indices and a decrease in male HSI. Secondly, we show that cortisol treatment induces (1) an increase in male courtship behaviour and in the intensity of male typical coloration, (2) a weight loss in males and (3) an increase in female HSI. Overall, we demonstrate that cortisol promotes reproduction in both sexes of A. reicherti with sexually distinct effects, representing a clear exception to the traditional role of the stress response impairing reproduction.

AB In altricial birds, leaving the nest is a key life history transition associated with a high risk of mortality. Studies of numerous species have shown that young typically fledge early in the day, and it is often asserted that early fledging is important for survival; however, evidence for this hypothesis is limited. We used an automated monitoring system to obtain precise fledging times of 1582 young blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, from 230 nests. As expected, nestlings primarily fledged early in the day (84% fledged before midday). However, we found no evidence that early fledging was associated with higher postfledging survival (i.e. recorded the following autumn or later). We propose two alternative explanations for the morning peak in fledging. Hypothesis 1 is that some offspring reach a developmental threshold for fledging overnight and leave the nest early the next day. This is supported by our observation that offspring that fledged early in the day tended to be more developed than those that fledged later in the day, that is, they were older and had a high body mass (measured at 14 days of age) for their fledging age. Hypothesis 2 is that the timing of fledging is related to parental provisioning behaviour. Our results do not support this hypothesis. Parents reduced their nest visit rate over the course of the day, but offspring did not fledge earlier when their parents decreased their visit rate more strongly with time of day. In conclusion, our results do not support the notion that the time of fledging affects survival but suggest a link with nestling development.

AB Despite the controlled testing conditions that are typical of captive environments, many evaluations of animal cognition fail to ensure that all tested individuals participate. This is even more evident under wild conditions, as animals are not restricted in their movement or social interactions and have other activities available. In this study, we aimed to understand variation in cognitive task participation in wild chacma baboons, Papio ursinus. We quantified individual differences in the latency and likelihood to approach and explore two types of stimuli for two cognitive tests: a set of coloured paper bags (in an associative learning test) and a blue cardboard square (in a second-order conditioning test). We evaluated whether participation in each task was predicted by individuals' phenotypic traits/states, as well as by two additional aspects of their behaviour: (1) the availability of competing activities at the time of testing and (2) their propensity to exploit social information. We found consistent results for both types of stimuli regarding the effect of age: juveniles were more likely to contact the stimuli and explore them for longer. Similarly, for both tasks, individuals involved in an activity at the time of testing were less likely to contact the stimuli and had a lower exploration time. Finally, juveniles and females with a high propensity to use social information (i.e. scrounge) were more likely, and had shorter latencies, to contact the paper bags. Our findings not only highlight the potential bias cognitive studies conducted in the wild can have, but also some of the individual attributes and external factors that determine task participation.

AB In many migratory insects, migration occurs during the prereproductive phase of the life cycle. This trait probably arises from a trade-off between migration and reproduction and in females has been termed the 'oogenesis-flight syndrome'. However, the generality of this syndrome has been questioned, especially for monomorphic insects. We studied the relationship between migration and reproduction in the highly cosmopolitan painted lady butterfly, Vanessa cardui, which in the Palaearctic undertakes the longest known multigenerational migration circuit of any insect. We tested for the oogenesis-flight syndrome in both spring and autumn migrants in two regions linked by migration, North Africa and northern Spain. Field observations were combined with laboratory experiments to determine the life span and the age at first mating to unravel the reproductive strategy observed in wild-caught individuals. Females and males wait on average around 5-6 days before mating, and field data revealed that mating frequencies increased rapidly once females reached a medium wing wear category. There were seasonal differences in mating frequencies in the study regions depending on whether the region acted as a source or as a destination for migrants, and in the latter case there were almost twice as many mated females. Moreover, a great majority of females collected during migratory flights were unmated, the remaining females having mated only very recently. Our results thus strongly indicate that the painted lady fulfils the oogenesis-flight syndrome, as migration is concentrated in its relatively short prereproductive period. Field data also showed a high positive correlation between mating frequency and host plant abundance, which suggests that mated females are able to locate potential breeding areas. This, together with the high fecundity estimated in laboratory trials, makes the painted lady a highly successful migratory insect. (c) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB y Bees efficiently learn asocial and social cues to optimize foraging from fluctuating floral resources. However, it remains unclear how bees respond to divergent sources of social information, and whether such social cues might modify bees' natural preferences for nonsocial cues (e.g. flower colour), hence affecting foraging decisions. Here, we investigated honey bees', Apis mellifera, inspection and choices of unfamiliar flowers based on both natural colour preferences and simultaneous foraging information from conspecifics and heterospecifics. Individual honey bees' preferences for flowers were recorded when the reward levels of a learned flower type had declined and novel-coloured flowers were available where they would find either no social information or one conspecific and one heterospecific bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, each foraging from a different coloured flower (magenta or yellow). Honey bees showed a natural preference for magenta flowers. They modified their inspection of both types of flowers in response to conspecific and heterospecific social information. The presence of a conspecific demonstrator on the less-preferred yellow flower increased honey bees' inspection of yellow flowers and the likelihood of foraging on them, thus outweighing the original preference for magenta flowers. The presence of a heterospecific on a magenta flower increased honey bees' inspection of magenta flowers, but this effect was not observed when bumble bees fed on yellow flowers. Our results indicate that flower colour preferences of honey bees are rapidly adjusted in response to both conspecific and heterospecific presence, in different ways, with a preference for conspecific information possibly favouring the transmission of adaptive foraging information within species.

AB Social interactions can shape daily activity patterns, and this is an area of growing research interest. The propensity for individuals to be active at certain times of day may structure interactions with competitors and potential mates, influencing fitness outcomes. Aspects of daily activity such as timing of activity onset and offset exhibit within-individual repeatability, which raises the possibility that they may be subject to natural and sexual selection. This study used a biologging approach in free-living Arctic ground squirrels, Urocitellus partyii, to test the hypothesis that interactions between the sexes shape temporal patterns of daily activity. We predicted that males would become active earlier than females during the mating period, consistent with sexual selection on activity timing. We also examined repeatability in activity timing and how repeatability estimates are affected by sampling methodology. We deployed collar-mounted light loggers on ground squirrels and used timing of light transitions to determine daily onset and offset of above-ground activity. We observed 87 animals over 3 years, collecting over 7500 observations of daily activity. We found that daily activity timing had moderate (onset) to low (offset) adjusted repeatability. The difference in daily activity timing between the sexes varied seasonally: males remained active later than females during mating, while females initiated activity earlier and extended activity later during lactation. Adjusted repeatability estimates were sensitive to sampling methodology: they varied seasonally and declined with increased behavioural sampling. These results suggest that offset, not onset, may be shaped by sexual selection and that life history differences shape sex-dependent activity patterns in ground squirrels. We propose that activity onset may be under more strict circadian control than offset. This study suggests that researchers must consider seasonality and sampling design when estimating behavioural repeatability. Biologging could transform studies of individual variation by enabling high-frequency sampling of free-living animals. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Acoustic and rhythmic temporal patterns may have important roles both in animal vocalizations and in human music. Male rock hyraxes, Pro cavia capensis, advertise their quality and emotional state by singing a long complex song, comprising repetitive elements. Research has revealed that the temporal structure of hyrax songs is similar to a musical crescendo, as it includes a gradual increase in amplitude, along with several additional acoustic and structural parameters, throughout the song. In hyrax songs, the snort is a relatively rare, low and harsh vocal element, which increases in number as the song progresses. We have previously shown that mean snort harshness is positively linked to both the singer's social status and testosterone levels, possibly reflecting inner arousal. Here, we measured the changes in snort harshness and length during natural hyrax songs. Our results indicate that in mature males, harshness, quantified by shimmer and jitter, increases as the song progresses. We suggest that increasing snort harshness may either (1) indicate the progression of inner excitement or aggression throughout the song or (2) that the harshness may reflect the difficulty of vocal control following increasing effort or the physical fatigue of the vocal cords. In western culture music, such progression is used to increase listener tension and thus retain attention, preventing possible habituation. Thus, understanding the development and progression of challenging elements within animal communication systems may reveal a key fundamental root of modern musical structure, and shed light on the evolutionary basis of musical perception.

AB Assessing local habitat quality via social cues provided by conspecific or heterospecific individuals sharing the same needs is a widespread strategy of social information use for breeding habitat selection. However, gathering information about putative competitors may involve agonistic costs. The use of social cues reflecting local habitat quality acquired from a distance, such as acoustic cues, could therefore be favoured. Bird songs are conspicuous signals commonly assumed to reliably reflect producer quality, and thereby local site quality. Birds of various species have been shown to be attracted to breeding sites by conspecific and heterospecific songs, and to use conspecific song features as information on producer (and by extension habitat) quality. Whether they can do the same with heterospecific song features, and whether this depends on the individual's own phenotype and especially its competitive ability, remains unknown. We used a playback experiment in a wild population of collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, a species known to eavesdrop on the presence and performance of dominant great tits, Parus major. We tested whether flycatchers, whose aggressiveness was experimentally assessed, preferred to settle near playback of a high-quality great tit song (i.e. song with large repertoire size, long strophes, high song rate), a low-quality great tit song or a chaffinch song (control). Among old females, aggressive ones preferred to settle near playback of high-quality tit song and avoided playback of low-quality tit song, while less aggressive females preferred to settle near playback of low-quality tit song. Male personality or age did not influence settlement decisions. This shows that collared flycatcher females use great tit song quality features as information for settlement decisions, although this depended on their own competitive ability and/or previous experience with great tit songs. Our study therefore further illustrates the complex condition-dependent use of heterospecific social information for breeding habitat selection.

AB By studying animal vocalizations such as birdsong, our capacity to record and interpret acoustic data has opened many opportunities for objective studies of animal behaviour, song evolution, physiology and ecology. However, the analysis of such data sets is often complex, and can vary between research teams, study species and theoretical approach. We test the use of network analysis in categorical birdsong data sets, focusing on four main applications: (1) quantifying and describing patterns of song sharing between individuals and/or populations; (2) understanding factors driving, and the implications of, an individual's position within a song-sharing network; (3) analysing (song or syllable) transfer patterns; and (4) investigating how environmental factors influence song-sharing networks. This exercise provides an excellent example of the advantages of sharing methodologies across disciplines within behavioural ecology and will hopefully inform future studies focused on different aspects of song sharing and cultural evolution by providing new tools and techniques for analysis.

AB Collective signalling occurs in diverse animal groups. A particularly well-studied form of this sophisticated communication behaviour is vocal duetting in birds, in which members of a mated pair coordinate their songs on short temporal scales. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of bird duets, but the experimental evidence for them is still somewhat conflicting. Studies on songbirds often provide support for the joint resource defence or mate-guarding hypotheses. We investigated these hypotheses for a nesting cuckoo, the white-browed coucal, Centropus superciliosus, by presenting territorial pairs with four types of playback treatment: male-female duets, female solos, male solos, and a heterospecific control. The observed birds reacted aggressively to the conspecific playback by approaching the playback loudspeaker and singing. Pairs responded with duets more often to duet playbacks than to playbacks of female and male solo song. Also, neither sex treated simulated unmated intruders (solo playback) as more threatening than mated intruders (duet playback). Taken together, these findings argue against the mate-guarding hypothesis and instead suggest that duetting in white-browed coucals functions primarily in joint territory defence. In almost all cases, males were the first sex to sing in response to playbacks and, overall, they sang more than females. This suggests that males take a primary role in territorial defence. However, females also responded strongly, especially to the simulation of mated or unmated female intruders, hinting at a sex-specific division of labour in territorial defence.

AB Accurate visual object recognition is essential to survival for a wide range of species across a wide range of evolutionary histories and visual requirements. However this task is solved, it is a major achievement because object recognition is far from simple. The appearance of an object can alter almost completely as viewing conditions change, not least under variations in lighting and orientation. Determining the recognition limits of a species is important to understanding its visual ecology and can help identify conditions under which recognition may fail. In this study, we tested whether a species of fish can recognize objects from an unfamiliar object class (human faces) across changes in viewing direction. Using operant conditioning, we trained archerfish, Toxotes chatareus, to discriminate between two frontal views of standardized human faces and, critically, tested whether they could continue to do so as the orientation in depth of the faces changed. All fish learned the initial discrimination task and could also recognize rotated forms. These results represent the first conclusive evidence that a species of fish can generalize recognition across views, speaking against a strict image-matching process. This ability rather speaks to the capacity of relatively simple brains to tackle the hard problem of view invariance and provides insight into the mechanisms employed in more complex organisms such as humans. Although we speculate that other fish species may demonstrate similar abilities, a visual system capable of recognition across changes in viewpoint may be especially important to the unique hunting strategy of archerfish.

AB Parental investment theory predicts that parents should adjust their investment in offspring defence according to offspring value (i.e. the probability they will contribute to the next generation). Although previous research has shown this offspring value prediction is generally supported in unitary organisms, the 'superorganisms' formed by advanced colonial organisms have rarely been tested, and never by direct manipulation of offspring value. As an important complement to correlational studies, such a test would help better illuminate the applicability of the parental investment theory to that higher level of biological organization, as well as provide insight into the depth of the superorganism analogy. Here I use colonies of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, in a manipulative experiment to test whether superorganisms behave as predicted by the parental investment theory and invest more in defence (deliver larger venom doses) when protecting higher-value offspring. In addition, to test a proposed mechanism for observed increases, I conducted an experiment to investigate whether S. invicta alarm pheromone modulates venom dose. I found that colonies delivered larger venom doses when defending nests containing higher-value (sexual) offspring than when defending worker-destined brood, but I found no venom dose increase as a result of additional alarm pheromone. The conformity of S. invicta colonies to the offspring value prediction of the parental investment theory supports the theory's applicability to their higher (superorganismal) level of animal organization. It furthermore underscores that the superorganism concept is deeper than simple anatomical/organizational analogy, but extends also to colony-level behaviour.

AB Acoustic signals are widely used as sexual displays to attract mates. The choice of display site can strongly influence the male call characteristics and their attractiveness to females. Males can improve the conspicuousness of their signals by increasing sound amplitude and expanding their broadcast area thereby reaching more potential mating partners and influencing female choice. Insects possess a rather limited degree of signal plasticity. To increase the intensity of their calls, insects have been known to manipulate and engineer their display locations. Mole crickets, for example, build burrows that are shaped like horns, designing the burrow such that its resonance closely matches that of their call frequency, thereby boosting sound amplitude. Tree crickets manipulate plant leaves, using them as baffles for optimal sound radiation. In this study, we show for the first time that an insect species can enhance its advertisement calls by using novel, anthropogenic environments as singing sites. During this study, the tropical cricket Anurogryllus muticus was frequently found singing beside the walls of houses, on concrete stairs or in storm drains. These locations significantly increased the sound amplitude of its calls, by an average of 13 and 7 dB SPL, respectively, as measured above and in front of the singing animals compared to the sound amplitude measured in their natural grassland habitat. To evaluate the effect of calling site choice on the male's life span, we conducted a 35-day population survey using the mark and recapture method. Our results revealed that those males that called in grassland habitat without occupying burrows had the shortest minimum life spans. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Studies of sexual selection acting on physical strength in humans have focused mostly on its role in premating male-male competition. Recent theoretical frameworks suggest that male strength could be subject to trade-offs with postmating sperm competitiveness. Here, we examined whether male strength is linked to ejaculate quality. We also asked whether strength is attractive to women and affects male self-reported mating success. Perceived strength was negatively associated with ejaculate quality as predicted by the trade-off hypothesis. Perceived strength positively predicted attractiveness and both perceived strength and attractiveness shared similar variance in predicting self-reported mating success. Our findings indicate that despite the benefits to premating sexual selection, having greater strength may come at a cost to sperm competitiveness.

AB When males and females have distinct behaviour, learning may vary between the sexes. Polistes fuscatus wasps provide an interesting model to study sex differences in learning because males and females have different social behaviour. Female wasps have highly variable facial patterns used for individual face recognition, live in cooperative groups where interactions depend on individual face recognition and excel at learning female faces. In contrast, male wasps lack the type of variable facial patterns necessary for individual face recognition and do not participate in the type of social interactions known to favour individual recognition in females. Instead, males leave the nest soon after adulthood and devote their energy to mating. Given the behavioural differences between males and females, females may be more adept at learning wasp faces than males. Here, we train male and female P. fuscatus to discriminate between pairs of female P. fuscatus face images and pairs of colours. Females learned to discriminate between pairs of face images more accurately than males. However, males and females were equally adept at colour learning, indicating that there are no generalized sex differences in learning. The sex differences in face, but not colour, learning are consistent with the adaptive specialization hypothesis, which posits that cognitive abilities are selected to solve particular social or ecological problems. Overall, general learning capacity is similar across male and female wasps, but face learning is shaped by sex-specific recognition behaviour.

AB Intraguild (IG)-prey prefer to oviposit at sites with a low IG-predation risk of their offspring. However, IG-predators sometimes show oviposition preferences similar to those of IG-prey. In such cases, IG-prey eggs might need protection against IG-predators to survive. We tested this possibility using a system that consisted of an IG-prey, the predatory mite Gynaeseius liturivorus, and an IG-predator, the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus. Both mite species feed on larvae of the western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, as a shared food source. When offered plastic discs as substrates for oviposition, both mite species preferred to lay eggs on the discs, regardless of the presence of heterospecifics. Subsequently, we examined G. liturivorus egg survival in the presence of only conspecific mothers or N. californicus, and the presence and absence of both mite species. The survival of G. liturivorus eggs was significantly reduced when kept with only N. californicus, but this reduction was not found in the presence of both G. liturivorus and N. californicus. These results indicate that G. liturivorus mothers improved the survival of the eggs in the presence of N. californicus. Behavioural observation revealed that adult female G. liturivorus mostly remained on the plastic discs with their own eggs during experiments. Furthermore, the presence of G. liturivorus mothers reduced the residence time of N. californicus on plastic discs with G. liturivorus eggs, whereas the residence time of G. liturivorus mothers was not affected by the presence of N. californicus. We conclude that mothers of G. liturivorus are able to increase the survival of their eggs by deterring IG-predators. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The oscine passerines, an avian suborder that comprises almost half of all bird species worldwide, learn their song primarily through cultural transmission. As the world's forests become increasingly fragmented and the population sizes of many forest-dwelling species decline, there may be increasingly restricted opportunities for the transmission of cultural information. However, the effects of forest fragmentation on birdsong have not been well documented. In this paper, we examine the relationship between forest fragment size and song characteristics for two forest bird species, an oscine passerine (orange-billed sparrow, Arremon aurantiirostris) that learns its song culturally, and a suboscine passerine (scale-crested pygmy tyrant, Lophotriccus pileatus) that does not. Recordings were taken from individuals in 12 premontane wet forest fragments ranging in size from approximately 1.4 ha-360 ha in southern Costa Rica. As predicted under the 'cultural erosion' hypothesis, we found that acoustic characteristics associated with song complexity such as the number of syllables per song and song duration decreased with decreasing fragment size for the oscine but not for the suboscine species. This study supports the idea that learned cultural elements are sensitive to fragment size and that cultural diversity should be considered along with other forms of biodiversity in the conservation of social learning species.

AB Cultural diversity among social groups has recently been documented in multiple animal species. Investigations of the origin and spread of diverse behaviour at group level in wild-ranging animals have added valuable information on social learning mechanisms under natural conditions. Behavioural diversity has been especially informative in the case of dispersal, where the transfer of individuals between groups leads to a sudden exposure to unfamiliar behaviour. Little is known, however, about the underlying costs and benefits of cultural transmission in animals and humans alike, as efficiency of cultural variants is often difficult to measure. The chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, of the Tai National Park in Ivory Coast are known to exhibit a number of cultural differences between social groups, including hammer selection for nut cracking. This provides the unique opportunity to quantify the efficiency of cultural variants. We compared foraging speed and number of hits applied during nut-cracking events between three neighbouring chimpanzee groups. Our results showed significant differences in nut-cracking efficiency, caused by hammer material selection and differences in the applied power of impact per nut. Persistent behavioural coherence within the respective groups implies that immigrants adjust their behaviour to local nut-cracking techniques, even when individual foraging success might be compromised. This suggests that the benefit of belonging to a social group might outweigh the benefits of maximizing individual foraging efficiency. The differences in nut-cracking efficiency between chimpanzee groups add to the ever-growing body of cultural variants in wild chimpanzees and expand our knowledge of the importance of group belonging and conformity in wild chimpanzees.

AB Males of the brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus (Theridiidae), invest energy in courtship displays and are often cannibalized after mating; accordingly, partial sex role reversal is expected. In this species, subadult females are able to mate and produce viable offspring. In contrast to mature females, these subadult females do not cannibalize their mates after copulation. Nevertheless, when given a choice, males preferred mature over subadult females and older over young mature females. We found no benefit for males in mating with the females of their choice. Older females were significantly less fecund than young mature females, and were not more fecund than subadult females. We tested possible advantages in mating with cannibalistic (mature) females, such as an increased probability of plugging the female's genital duct or longer copulations, or disadvantages in mating with subadult females, such as higher remating risk. None of these explanations was supported. Thus, we lack an adaptive explanation for male preference for mature older females. We suggest that older females produce more pheromone to attract males and that males are thus misled into mating with older, more aggressive and less fecund females.

AB In species with biparental care, females often provide more care than males. Previous work has focused on sex differences in parental food provisioning and defence against predators. However, parents often also defend their offspring against conspecific intruders, which could be male or female. Thus, there is a need for studies examining sex differences in the behaviour of both caring parents and intruders, and whether sex differences in the behaviour of caring parents depend upon the intruder's sex. We conducted an experiment on the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides where a single female or male resident caring for a brood was confronted with a male or female intruder. Female residents were more successful in defending their brood and engaged in more fights against an intruder than males. Residents engaged in more fights against male intruders and, among those that successfully defended their brood, residents spent more time provisioning food to larvae when confronted with female intruders. There was no evidence that sex differences in the behaviour of caring parents depended upon the intruder's sex. There were no sex differences in any measures of reproductive success among those residents that successfully defended their brood and no sex differences in the life span or mass gain of either residents or intruders. Our study extends the study of sex differences in parental care to the context of defence against conspecific intruders by demonstrating sex differences in the behaviour of both residents and intruders and sex differences in reproductive success in the presence of conspecific intruders.

AB Fighting experience (specifically winning or losing a fight) can significantly alter boldness, a component of resource-holding potential (RHP). Previous studies have shown that both the repeatability of boldness and mean-level boldness can be affected by fighting experience and that these effects are strongest in the recipients of agonistic behaviour. However, whether these postfight changes in boldness impact future contest success and whether subsequent contests further affect boldness remain unknown. Furthermore, little is known about the effects of the specific tactics used within a fight (within-fight experience) and how these might influence future fight performance and boldness. Here, we investigated the relationship between fighting success and boldness (measured as recovery time when startled) across repeated contests in the beadlet sea anemone, Actinia equina, measuring boldness on five occasions before, between and after two contests. We found that boldness (both repeatability and mean-level) was generally robust to the effects of fighting experience, apart from a decrease in the immediate boldness of losers after their second fight. Furthermore, we found that while prefight boldness significantly predicted fighting success and the level of aggression used in an individual's first fight, it did not predict victory or aggression in the second fight. Our findings thus indicate that different traits may be important in determining fighting success in consecutive fights and, moreover, that fighting experience may alter which traits contribute to an individual's RHP.

AB According to socioecological theory, ecological pressures acting on females play an important role in shaping social organization, dispersal patterns and the nature of female-female relationships. However, there has been relatively little consideration of how females' relationships with males may influence the nature of females' relationships to other females. Here, we show that female olive baboons form well-differentiated relationships with adult males and these ties influence their relationships with other females. As in other species of savanna baboons, female olive baboons show pronounced preferences for close kin, but related females do not often share the same top-ranked male partners. Shared associations with males bring females into more frequent contact with distant kin and nonkin. The combined effects of bringing distantly related and unrelated females together and separating close kin reduced the extent of nepotistic biases among females in the study groups compared to female yellow baboons, Papio cynocephalus, and chacma baboons, Papio ursinus. These data suggest that selective pressures acting on both females and males may influence the nature and function of female-female relationships.

AB Male exploitation of female sensory or motivational biases has been proposed to account for the early evolution of nuptial gift-giving behaviour. The hypothesis is supported if females of a species positioned early in a clade respond positively to sexual signals from males of more recent species in the clade, and if these signals are not included in the courtship repertoire of its conspecific males. We tested whether such a scenario may apply to the evolution of gift-giving behaviour in the spider family Pisauridae. Presumably, the Canarian endemic Cladycnis insignis diverged on an early branch from the clade that includes the well-known nuptial gift-giving species Pisaura mirabilis. We first showed that the natural courtship and mating in C. insignis does not include gift-giving behaviour. Second, by staging female C. insignis with gift-carrying males of P. mirabilis, we found that these females accepted the gift and allowed the males to attempt mating. The duration of heterospecific 'matings' was much longer than conspecific matings (45-50 min versus ca. 1 min). Thus, there is scope for exploitation of the females' foraging motivation through a behavioural switch from courting without a prey gift to courting with a prey gift. Such a switch would initially have brought huge fitness benefits to these males in terms of greatly increased mating duration (advantage in sperm competition) and protection against aggressive females (shield effect), and also a benefit to the females from increased food supply.

AB Animal personalities can influence social interactions among individuals, and thus have major implications for population processes and structure. Few studies have investigated the significance of the social context of animal personalities, and such research has largely focused on the social organization of nonterritorial populations. Here we address the question of whether exploratory behaviour, a well-studied personality trait, is related to the social structure of a wild great tit, Parus major, population during the breeding season. We assayed the exploration behaviour of wild-caught great tits and then established the phenotypic spatial structure of the population over six consecutive breeding seasons. Network analyses of breeding proximity revealed that males, but not females, show positive assortment by behavioural phenotype, with males breeding closer to those of similar personalities. This assortment was detected when we used networks based on nearest neighbours, but not when we used the Thiessen polygon method where neighbours were defined from inferred territory boundaries. Further analysis found no relationship between personality assortment and local environmental conditions, suggesting that social processes may be more important than environmental variation in influencing male territory choice. This social organization during the breeding season has implications for the strength and direction of both natural and sexual selection on personality in wild animal populations.

AB This paper describes a 30-year investigation into the role of social and ecological factors affecting song learning in song sparrows, Melospiza melodia. It addresses the question of why song sparrows learn the songs they do, given that they are exposed to many more songs than they will keep for their final repertoire of 7-11 song types. A young song sparrow moves from his natal area at about 1 month of age, eventually settling in an area where he learns the songs of the resident males and attempts to establish his own territory. Birds that share many songs with their neighbours in their first breeding season (the spring following their hatch summer) survive for more years on territory than birds that do not. Many features of the song-learning process lead to a high level of sharing with first-year neighbours, including preferentially learning the songs of their tutor-neighbours who survive the winter, and learning songs that are shared by several tutors. Social interaction appears to be critical in song learning, but indirect effects (eavesdropping on adults countersinging) seem to be at least as important as direct interaction between the young bird and his tutor-neighbours. Although our evidence suggests that the song-learning strategy of young song sparrows is beneficial to them, a preliminary analysis suggests it may not benefit their tutors.

AB Residency has repeatedly evolved in many migratory animals, some of which have preserved the anatomical adaptations to perform long-range movements. This is the case for partially migratory populations of Mediterranean passerines in which migrants and residents both have a migrant morphology. The question of how selection maintains residency in this situation remains unclear. Using radiotelemetry, we followed the resident fraction of a partially migratory population of blackcaps, Sylvia atricapilla, from eastern Spain and studied changes in home range size and habitat composition throughout three breeding and two wintering seasons. We then compared these birds with two groups of migratory blackcaps present in the area: in winter with migrants that breed in northern populations and in spring with migrants that breed locally. In addition, we observed aggressive interactions between individually marked birds to explore dominance relationships during winter. The home ranges of resident blackcaps were six times larger in winter than during the breeding season, but within each season, they were comparable in size to those of migrants. The habitats used by residents markedly differed between seasons as well as from those of migrants in winter, but not during the breeding season. In winter, resident birds were dominant over migrants, although migrants were generally larger. Overall, residents showed high between-season flexibility in home range size and habitat use. Winter home ranges of residents included breeding sites and more diverse types of habitats than those of northern migrants. This suggests that in winter, the importance of dominance for obtaining priority access to food may be high but not crucial, given that residents may reduce competition by feeding separately from migrants. Future studies should focus on whether residents show specific personalities and on the role of yearly oscillations in environmental conditions in maintaining residency in this type of partially migratory population.

AB Prey-predator interactions are plastic behaviours shown by both players, which constantly modify their decisions depending on physiological conditions and ecological context. We investigated whether the behavioural response to repeated simulated predatory attacks varied between adult males of the common wall lizard, Podarcis muralis, inhabiting environments characterized by different degrees of human presence. Our aim was to detect possible effects of urbanization on antipredator responses, in terms of activity, time spent hidden in refuges and habituation. Moreover, since this lizard species exhibits intrapopulation colour polymorphism, we looked for the occurrence of possible correlations between antipredator strategy and individual ventral coloration. We found that urban lizards spent less time in their refuge after predatory attacks and decreased successive hiding times faster than rural lizards, suggesting different wariness towards a potential predator. Irrespective of population, yellow lizards gradually spent less time in the refuge before appearing and emerging outside than the other two morphs. Conversely, red lizards showed progressively longer appearance and emergence times after successive tests, suggesting a growing sensitization to the potential threat of a predatory attack. In conclusion, our study showed the occurrence of different levels of behavioural plasticity in common wall lizard's antipredator response: the population level, depending on ecological context, here different degrees of exposure to human disturbance, and the individual level, which suggests the occurrence of morph-specific antipredator strategies. Thus, using a lizard species as a model, we shed light on two key points of evolutionary ecology concerning both the antipredator response and the factors driving the maintenance of intraspecific polymorphism.

AB Animals decide which potential mate to pair with based on their subjective evaluation of each candidate mate's attractiveness. Attractiveness and its perception are plastic traits, dependent upon genetic and environmental factors. When evaluating mate attractiveness, in some cases animals make predictive judgements of mate reproductive potential, or fitness, based on the mate's condition. Diet, a fluctuating environmental factor, influences health and conditional states. However, how dietary enrichment of individual macronutrients (fat, protein or sugar) affects behaviour, mate choice and reproductive outcomes in both sexes is not fully understood. Here we show that a moderate increase in dietary macronutrients alters attractiveness, mate preference and reproductive output of Drosophila melanogaster. Our results demonstrate that diet is an important factor in determining mating behaviour and reproductive output, acting in a sex-specific fashion. These findings provide a framework for exploring the genetic mechanisms that drive changes in mating behaviour, fitness and, hence, trait evolution.

AB Alarm signals are widespread in the social insects. It is commonly accepted that such signals produce adaptive short-term aggressive or aversive responses in conspecifics, but the possibility that they could also lead to social learning about predator identity has not yet been addressed. Here we demonstrated that responses to alarm volatiles can lead to social learning about asocial stimuli in honeybees. Using a phototactic assay, we initially confirmed previous findings that alarm volatiles deter individuals from approaching a coloured light. When the same individuals subsequently experienced the coloured light in the absence of alarm volatiles, the same deterrent effect was observed, suggesting that responses to alarm volatiles became conditioned to the coloured light. Previous experience with the light in the absence of alarm cues did not induce this response, nor did previous association of alarm cues with a different coloured light. Our findings highlight that social insect signals can lead to social learning through a simple yet powerful associative mechanism. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB For decades, scientists have used threat conditioning (traditionally termed 'fear conditioning') to study the link between glucocorticoids and the consolidation of long-term memories (i.e. memories that last hours to weeks) in model organisms in the laboratory. We assessed this relationship in a free-living species, and examined a possible relationship between glucocorticoids and the retention of longlasting memories (i.e. memories that last months to a lifetime). We developed a novel threat-conditioning protocol by which free-living Florida scrub-jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens, were either chased by a novel predator or exposed to a control. We measured flight initiation distance (FID) 48 h, 11 months and 2 years after conditioning or control exposures, and compared these measures to levels of stress-induced glucocorticoids. Conditioned subjects maintained significantly longer FIDs for at least 2 years. Furthermore, the long-term memory consolidation of conditioned subjects positively correlated with their stress-induced glucocorticoid response, similar to results from laboratory studies. Surprisingly, individuals with a moderate stress response exhibited an exaggerated defence response (i.e. FIDs increased) at 11 months and 2 years post-conditioning, whereas low and high stress responders exhibited memory decay or extinction (i.e. FIDs decreased). We speculate that the recently discovered processes of memory reconsolidation and system consolidation may help explain why some Florida scrub-jays exhibit more fearful-like behaviour with time.

AB Investigating how environmental factors influence within-species trait variability is critical to understanding the evolution and maintenance of individual behavioural differences (i.e. temperament or personality), and their integration into wider ecological theory. Populations of Australian desert gobies, Chlamydogobius eremius, from starkly contrasting aquatic environments in arid Australia were used to investigate how environmental differences influence temperament traits. Focusing on boldness and exploration, fish were assessed using novel environment, dispersal and novel food item assays under laboratory conditions. The results of these experiments were analysed for repeatability and for patterns of divergence within and between populations. We found consistent within-species differences in novel environment and novel food item assays, with refuge emergence and inspection latency of a novel food item both strongly repeatable behavioural axes. Although both traits can be considered measures of boldness, refuge emergence significantly diverged according to sex, while inspection latency was predicted by habitat differences. This suggests that multiple measures of boldness are diverging independently according to different ecological drivers. Specifically, we found that fish caught from environments without predators and with probable intense intraspecific competition are less active and bolder in a novel food item context. Further analysis demonstrated how extreme habitat differences are driving behavioural divergence on multiple axes, relating to boldness and dispersal behaviours. This provides valuable insights into how the environment and behaviour interact and how we define temperament traits, as well as highlighting the importance of studying temperament within a community ecology context.

AB Copying others can be used to enhance foraging and mating opportunities, but can be costly due to the need to monitor the actions of others, which can take time away from foraging and antipredator vigilance. However, little is known about the way animals monitor conspecifics. We investigated the mechanism that European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, use to visually monitor group mates in perching situations through two questions. First, do starlings copy the timing of each other's vigilance? Second, do they use their centres of acute vision to monitor group mates? We studied a component of vigilance that has received relatively little attention, lateral scans, which consist of changes in the orientation of the head (i.e. gaze shifting) while in a head-up position. We found that starlings copied the timing of their neighbour's scans, placing them closer together in time than expected by chance. This could enhance the speed of social information spread within a group compared to random timing of head movements. The strength of this copying effect varied with neighbour distance and the sex of the follower and leader, suggesting that starlings appear to be more motivated to copy some individuals over others. Additionally, instead of monitoring neighbours with their centres of acute vision (high-quality vision), starlings tended to use their retinal periphery (low-acuity vision), potentially reducing the costs of social monitoring. Copying the timing of lateral scans may have advantages for gathering social information (i.e. quick responses to movements of group mates in situations such as murmurations). However, it can also have costs in terms of delaying the detection of personal information by any group member (e.g. predator attack) due to longer gaps without changes in gaze orientation. Therefore, copying the timing of lateral scans may be restricted to specific contexts (e.g. low predation risk). (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many animals show complex behaviours that can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Environmental variation can lead to divergent selection that consistently favours particular behaviours in different environments; but how predictably multiple aspects of animal behaviour diverge in response to different environmental conditions remains unclear. We tested whether populations evolving under different levels of predation risk show predictable and repeatable population-level behavioural differences in all five primary components of animal personality: aggression, sociability, boldness, activity and exploration. We formulated and tested a priori predictions of divergence for each behaviour using the adaptive radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish, Gambusia hubbsi (family Poeciliidae), inhabiting vertical water-filled caves (blue holes) where they have evolved for thousands of years in either the presence or absence of predatory fish. Mosquitofish behaviours differed consistently, and largely predictably, between predation regimes: low-predation mosquitofish showed reduced sociability and greater exploration of a novel environment compared to high-predation counterparts. However, some differences were sex dependent: only females showed greater boldness and only males displayed reduced aggressiveness in low-predation populations. Activity levels did not differ between predation regimes. All populations showed a behavioural syndrome characteristic of either proactive or reactive stress-coping styles with regard to exploration. Exploration behavioural syndromes were more similar among populations that evolved in similar predation regimes, regardless of genetic relatedness. Using laboratory-born, high-predation mosquitofish, we confirmed that exploratory behaviours have a genetic basis and show significant within-individual repeatability. Our results suggest that environmental variation, such as chronic predation risk, can lead to repeatable, and often predictable, changes in multifarious animal behaviours, and that various aspects of behaviour can diversify more or less independently of one another. Considering the ecological importance of these behaviours, the ability to forecast behavioural shifts in a rapidly changing world could serve as a valuable conservation tool.

AB Animal behaviour can provide valuable information for wildlife management and conservation. Studying the detailed behaviour of marine mammals involves challenges not faced by most animal behaviour researchers due to the size, mobility and lack of continuous visibility of these animals. We describe several methods developed by marine mammal scientists to study behaviour, primarily of cetaceans, focusing on technological advances: unmanned aerial systems (UAS), satellite-linked telemetry, passive acoustics and multisensor high-resolution acoustic recording tags. We then go on to explain how the data collected by these methods have contributed to and informed conservation actions. We focus on examples including: satellite data informing the interactions between cetaceans and offshore oil and gas development; passive acoustics used to track distributions of several species of cetaceans, including their movements near shipping lanes; and high-resolution acoustic recording tags used to document responses of cetaceans to anthropogenic activities. Finally, we discuss recent efforts to link animal behaviour to individual fitness and, particularly for behavioural disturbances, to population-level consequences, which can be helpful for informing conservation efforts. The infusion of technological advancements into studies of cetacean behaviour combined with emerging analytical techniques brings us to the next 20+ years of studying these animals. These developments will improve our capabilities in areas such as testing whether their behaviour adheres to traditional behavioural theory, and will certainly assist the guiding of conservation efforts.

AB How parents invest resources in offspring is a central aspect of life history. While investment strategies have been well studied in solitary organisms, comparatively little has been done on social species, including the many that reproduce by fission. Under colony fission, a parent colony divides resources (individuals) to form two or more offspring colonies. Because individuals differ in characteristics (e.g. size), there is opportunity for both quantitative and qualitative bias in their allocation. In this study we investigated the qualitative aspect of offspring investment during colony fission. Colonies of the ant Cataglyphis cursor fission into multiple offspring colonies as part of their lifecycle, and the distribution of workers is quantitatively biased. We found that investment is also qualitatively biased in terms of worker size and worker genetic characteristics (patrilines). This bias was mainly between the offspring colony that inherited the original nest and offspring colonies that dispersed to new nesting sites. In 74% of cases, dispersing colonies contained larger workers, and the distribution of genetic patrilines was biased in two of six cases in a manner that cannot be explained by the observed variation in worker size between patrilines. Fission also led to a reduction in diversity in offspring colonies compared to the parent colony, in terms of both worker size (70% of cases) and genetic diversity (40% of cases). These patterns are probably the result of differing dispersal probability between workers of different patrilines and of different size. This differential allocation may be adaptive because larger workers may be of disproportionate value to dispersing colonies, and their loss an acceptable cost to the colony inheriting the nest.

AB The extent to which animals respond fearfully to novel stimuli may critically influence their ability to survive alongside humans. However, it is unclear whether the fear of novel objects, object neophobia, consistently varies in response to human disturbance. Where variation has been documented, it is unclear whether this variation is due to a change in fear towards specific novel stimuli, or whether it is symptomatic of a general change in fear behaviour. We measured levels of object neophobia in free-flying birds across urban and rural habitats, comparing corvids, a family known for being behaviourally flexible and innovative, with other urban-adapting bird species. Neophobic responses were measured in the presence of different types of objects that varied in their novelty, and were compared to behaviour during a baited control. Corvids were more neophobic than noncorvid species towards all object types, but their hesitancy abated after conspecifics approached in experimental conditions in which objects resembled items they may have experienced previously. Both sets of species were faster to approach objects made from human litter in urban than rural areas, potentially reflecting a category-specific reduction in fear based on experience. These results highlight species similarities in behavioural responses to human-dominated environments despite large differences in baseline neophobia. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB In group-living mammals, social dominance can be achieved and maintained via kin support, winner-loser effects and individual differences in resource-holding potential (RHP). When dominance is based on RHP, the likelihood of winning is also influenced by the incentive to compete. For females, this equation can be quite complex, as both age and reproductive state can alter the relative value of resources and the risks associated with fighting. For example, females that are young, pregnant or lactating may have high nutritional demands, while lactating females also face risks associated with offspring survival. To date, however, there have been few studies investigating how such factors influence female agonistic relationships. Here, we use 2 years of data to evaluate how age and reproductive state influence the probability of winning, focusing on two groups (5-9 and 10-12 females) of wild Phayre's leaf monkeys, Trachypithecus phayrei crepusculus, at Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand. Consistent with previous studies, we found that young females and pregnant females were more likely to win dyadic interactions in the smaller group, PA. By contrast, the likelihood of winning was unrelated to age in the larger group, PB. Moreover, differences between reproductive states were less pronounced in PB, with females that were pregnant or in early lactation being more likely to win compared to females that were cycling. The deviating results for PB were likely associated with a greater number of competitors and small age differences intensifying intrasexual competition. These results highlight the importance of individual as well as demographic factors in female dominance relationships. In this population, females with high nutritional demands are more likely to win agonistic encounters, suggesting that female-female competition occurs primarily over access to resources.

AB Complex vocal signals, such as birdsong, contain acoustic elements that differ in both order and duration. These elements may convey socially relevant meaning, both independently and through their interactions, yet statistical methods that combine order and duration data to extract meaning have not, to our knowledge, been fully developed. Here we design novel semi-Markov methods, Bayesian estimation and classification trees to extract order and duration information from behavioural sequences and apply these methods to songs produced by male European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, in two social contexts in which the function of song differs: a spring (breeding) and autumn (nonbreeding) context. Additionally, previous data indicate that damage to the medial preoptic nucleus (POM), a brain area known to regulate male sexually motivated behaviour, affects structural aspects of starling song such that males in a sexually relevant context (i.e. spring) sing shorter songs than appropriate for this context. We further test the utility of our statistical approach by comparing attributes of song structure in POM-lesioned males to song produced by control spring and autumn males. Spring and autumn songs were statistically separable based on the duration and order of phrase types. Males produced more structurally complex aspects of song in spring than in autumn. Spring song was also longer and more stereotyped than autumn song, both attributes used by females to select mates. Songs produced by POM-lesioned males in some cases fell between measures of spring and autumn songs but differed most from songs produced by autumn males. Overall, these statistical methods can effectively extract biologically meaningful information contained in many behavioural sequences given sufficient sample sizes and replication numbers.

AB Social insect societies maintain homeostasis through decentralized collective effort. In quickly changing environments, homeostasis can be difficult, as information may promptly become outdated. How do decentralized social insect groups respond to rapid environmental changes? Honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) workers use thermoregulatory fanning behaviour as part of their repertoire to maintain nest temperatures below 36 degrees C, as larvae can develop malformations and die if temperatures surpass this threshold. Here, we determine whether honeybees alter their fanning behaviour when experiencing different rates of thermal change. We found that honeybee fanners were significantly more likely to fan when experiencing rapidly increasing temperatures, but this response was only seen in larger groups of bees. Additionally, fanners responded at significantly lower temperatures when temperatures were increased quickly, but again, only when they were in larger groups. Our results show a statistically significant interaction between fanning response and group size. These findings illustrate the importance of exploring both response thresholds and probability of response of animals in social groups experiencing changing environments, as both factors affect homeostatic responses. Understanding how self-organized animal societies maintain homeostasis provides insight into decentralized organization across many biological systems.

AB Many animals produce sounds that overlap the sounds of others. In some animals, overlapping is thought to be an aggressive signal important in resource defence. Yet, overlapping can also occur by chance, and therefore its function is controversial. In this study, we conducted two experiments to test the function of overlapping in black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus. In experiment 1, we simulated territorial intrusions by broadcasting songs inside established chickadee territories. Resident males overlapped the playback-simulated intruders significantly less than expected by chance, as in most species in which overlapping has been described. Chickadees also overlapped more when they were farther from the intruder. This pattern suggests that chickadees avoid overlapping as a mechanism for reducing acoustic interference ('interference avoidance hypothesis'). However, the pattern could also constitute submissive signalling if chickadees signal de-escalation (associated with greater distance between opponents) through increasing rates of overlapping ('submissive signalling hypothesis'). Therefore, in experiment 2, we contrasted these two hypotheses by comparing responses to playback stimuli with low or high interference potential and low or high signal value. We manipulated interference potential by broadcasting stimuli at different amplitudes. We manipulated signal value by broadcasting either song stimuli, which elicit aggression, or white noise stimuli with matching time-amplitude characteristics. If overlapping is a submissive signal, then we predicted that chickadees would avoid overlapping song stimuli, but not white noise stimuli, which lack signal value. Contrary to this prediction, chickadees overlapped song and white noise stimuli equally often, but significantly less often than expected by chance. Furthermore, chickadees overlapped both types of stimuli more often when they were broadcast at lower amplitudes (i.e. lower interference potential). Together, these findings provide compelling evidence that overlapping is not a signal in this species, and that chickadees avoid overlapping both biotic and abiotic sounds as a mechanism for reducing interference.

AB Honesty of offspring begging behaviours is the keystone to understanding the evolution of parent-offspring communication. Three main begging costs have been traditionally advocated that ensure the reliability of offspring signalling: energy expenditure, loss of inclusive fitness and attraction of predators. Here, we propose that ectoparasites may eavesdrop on begging signals, especially acoustic signals, for host detection, a never considered but potentially generalized cost of begging that will constrain the evolution of exaggerated begging displays. Ectoparasitic insects possess a diversity of auditory systems for intraspecific communication that may be used to detect begging calls of host offspring. The use of auditory cues for host detection offers some advantages to ectoparasites, particularly in environments in which long-distance detection of hosts is necessary. There are well-known examples of interspecific eavesdropping on host auditory signals by parasites that include parasitoid flies attracted to calling crickets and cicadas, and frog-biting midges and mosquitoes attracted to frog calls. Eavesdropping on begging signals may have evolved in those parasites searching for hosts that display begging behaviours, which include not only birds but also mammals and some reptiles and insects with parental care of juveniles. Considering begging costs due to detection by ectoparasites may help us understand the reliability, and therefore the evolution, of signals of need and parenteoffspring communication.

AB Multiple mating to obtain genetic benefits has been championed as the most likely cause of the evolution of polygamy. However, this assumption has been put into question by an increasing number of recent studies, most of which highlight the importance of considering ecological constraints to comprehend variation in extrapair (EP) behaviour. Here, we studied patterns of extrapair paternity (EPP) in the great tit, Parus major, using data from 11 nestbox plots that differed in population size and breeding conditions. Specifically, we analysed EPP rates in relation to socioecological variables that could influence the way individuals encountered one another in space and time, we tested whether adults engaged in EPP with more heterozygous, more compatible or phenotypically superior individuals than their social mates and we analysed whether extrapair offspring (EPO) were phenotypically or genetically superior to within-pair offspring. Our results do not provide support for the genetic benefit hypothesis from either the male or the female perspective. EPO were heavier than their within-pair paternal half-siblings, but there was no significant difference between EPO and their within-pair maternal half-siblings in terms of phenotypic quality. Regarding socioecological factors, we found a negative relationship between breeding synchrony and EPP rates both within and among plots, which suggests that males face a trade-off between mate guarding and obtaining EPP elsewhere. Our results show that most males engaged in EPP after the fertile period of their social female despite having to travel long distances: about half of the detected cases of EPP involved individuals from different woodlands. This study indicates that when and where to engage in EPP seem to be more relevant factors than with whom to do it and highlights the importance of considering spatiotemporal constraints at a landscape scale to achieve a better understanding of variation in EP mating behaviour.

AB Conflict is an inherent part of group living, and the mediation of conflict is essential for the stability of social groups. Response to within-group social conflict should depend on the external social environment. Individuals in dense social neighbourhoods have greater opportunities to disperse and join a nearby group compared to individuals in sparse social neighbourhoods with few nearby groups. To explore the influence of the social neighbourhood on responses to conflict, we experimentally perturbed groups of wild Neolamprologus pulcher, a cooperatively breeding cichlid fish, by temporarily removing a subordinate individual. Such removals typically increase the amount of within-group aggression. As predicted, aggression towards the returning subordinate and the rate of eviction from the group increased with the density of neighbouring social groups. Furthermore, we predicted that the returning subordinate could improve its likelihood of reacceptance into the group by displaying submissively. To test this prediction, we attempted to manipulate submissive behaviour by injecting the removed individuals with isotocin, a nonapeptide hormone that has been shown in the laboratory to increase the expression of submissive behaviour in this species. As predicted, subordinates that received isotocin showed more submission when returned to their group. However, contrary to our prediction, these isotocin-treated fish received more aggression from their group-mates and were more likely to be evicted than fish receiving a saline control injection. Our results emphasize the importance of the social neighbourhood in determining within-group dynamics but surprisingly contradict the notion that submissive behaviour reduces aggression and facilitates group stability.

AB Social relationships vary in content, quality and patterning. Most researchers focus on whether and how nondispositional factors, including age, sex, kinship and rank, predict variance in the content, quality and patterning of relationships. However, within a species, these factors do not always predict partner choice. We examined whether similarity in any of five personality traits, Assertiveness, Openness, Neuroticism, Sociability and Attentiveness, independently contributed to variation in the affiliative and agonistic relationships of pairs of brown capuchin monkeys, Sapajus sp. Capuchins that were more similar in Neuroticism had higher affiliative relationship scores, while capuchins that were more similar in Sociability shared overall higher-quality relationships (i.e. the difference between the dyad's affiliative and agonistic scores). These effects were independent of age, sex, kinship and rank, suggesting that certain aspects of the psychology of these animals may contribute uniquely to the quality of their social relationships.

AB In many animals, after experiencing an intraspecific aggressive interaction, winners are more likely to win again (the winner effect) and losers more likely to lose again (the loser effect). However, the winner and loser effect has been studied in few arthropod models, and comparative approaches between the sexes are hard to find. In this study, we evaluated the role of previous experience in maleemale and female-female contests of Mediterranean fruit flies, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae). In this species, lekking males fight for courtship territories, while females fight to maintain single oviposition sites, as well as for mates. We addressed the following questions. (1) Are winners more likely to win again and losers more likely to lose again? (2) Are different interfight intervals critical to detect experience-induced effects on aggression? (3) Are winning and losing probabilities affected solely by the outcome of the previous contests, or is fighting experience itself sufficient to induce the effect? (4) Does experience affect differently aggression displayed by males and females? Results showed reduced fighting success in males and females that experienced a single defeat, while individuals that experienced two previous victories or defeats had higher aggression rates and more wins in subsequent contests (i.e. hyperaggression). This was achieved merely by experiencing a contest, while the actual outcomes of previous fights did not affect the aggressiveness level. Some differences were documented between male-male and female-female contests (e.g. females fought longer than males), showing the value of a comparative approach between the sexes when studying experience-induced hyperaggression. This study highlights that both consecutive victories and defeats enhance fighting performances of fruit fly males and females defending courtship territories and oviposition sites, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence about how repeated defeat experiences reverse the loser effect in animals, leading to higher fighting success.

AB The trade-off between starvation and predation risk is of paramount importance to songbirds and many other small organisms. A contaminant with metabolic or neurological effects may hinder a bird's ability to manage these ecological risks, which are contingent on metabolic state and require cognitive assessments. Methylmercury (MeHg) is a ubiquitous pollutant that is associated with neurotoxicity, reproductive failure, altered behaviour and increased mortality in aquatic organisms. It was recently discovered that MeHg can enter terrestrial food webs and affect songbirds that eat contaminated invertebrates. Research on behavioural effects of environmentally relevant doses of MeHg in songbirds is a conservation priority as this pollutant is widespread, poorly regulated, increasing and understudied in terms of sublethal effects such as abnormal behaviours. To help close this knowledge gap, we examined how MeHg affects behavioural strategies in captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. We quantified the birds' responses to risk by measuring regulation of body mass, vigilance behaviour, willingness to move away from dense cover in search of food and reluctance to return to foraging after a disturbance. Dosed and undosed birds were placed in an experimental arena and were videorecorded over 3 days of increasing perception of predation risk. We found that MeHg-exposed birds, compared to control birds, (1) lost significantly more mass and (2) waited significantly longer to forage under the highest predation risk. Our results indicate that MeHg-exposed birds may react more strongly to threat of predation and thereby increase their risk of starvation. To our knowledge this is the first mechanistic study of how a pervasive pollutant may alter optimal decision making, and therefore potentially survival, in songbirds.

AB Loss of sexual signals should be strongly selected against when these signals are necessary for mate attraction or acquisition. Male Teleogryllus oceanicus field crickets produce a long-distance calling song to attract females. Separate genetic mutations recently evolved on the Hawaiian Islands of Kauai and Oahu, rendering approximately 90% and 50% of males, respectively, incapable of calling. We examined whether males from three populations, each with a distinct prevalence of this silent 'flatwing' phenotype, show behavioural plasticity in response to being reared in a call-less environment. Crickets from Kauai, Oahu and Mangaia, a Cook Islands population without the flatwing phenotype, either were or were not exposed to calling song during late juvenile and early adult development. Movement assays showed that when males originating from Kauai were reared in silence, they moved sooner, moved more and spent more time walking during silent behaviour trials than did their counterparts reared with calling song. Males from Oahu and Mangaia, however, showed no such effect of acoustic rearing environment on these behaviours. This suggests that there has been directional selection on Kauai for males to respond to a silent environment by increasing their mobility, thus compensating for their lack of song and increasing their chance of encountering receptive females.

AB Investigating cognitively complex behaviours in their natural ecological context provides essential insights into the adaptive value of animal cognition. In this study, we investigated the selection of hammers used for cracking Coula nuts by wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, in the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire, taking account of the availability of potential tools at the site and time of tool selection. Using GLMMs and focal follows of five adult females, we estimated the probability of an object being selected as a hammer according to its physical properties, transport distance and the location of the anvil on the ground or in trees. We found that chimpanzees took account of several variables at the same time (multidimensionality) when selecting nut- cracking tools and that their selection for hammer weight was adjusted to the state/value of other variables (conditionality). In particular, chimpanzees (1) preferred stones over wooden clubs and hard woods over soft woods; (2) selected heavy stones, but relatively lighter wooden hammers; (3) selected increasingly heavier hammers the closer they were to the anvil; and (4) selected lighter hammers when they were going to crack nuts on a tree. The latter two results represent instances of conditional tool selection based on the next steps in an operational sequence (transport and/or use of the tool in a stable or unstable location) and suggest that chimpanzees anticipated future events when they chose a tool. This large set of conditional rules suggests a high level of cognitive sophistication in a tool use task. Our results represent a compelling example of how powerful cognitive skills allow the optimization of an ecologically relevant foraging activity, supporting a food extraction hypothesis for the evolution of complex cognition in our closest relatives.

   BEHAVIORAL COMPATIBILITY; ZONOTRICHIA-ALBICOLLIS; CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS
AB In animals with biparental care, maintaining a pair bond is of adaptive value because it increases reproductive success and reduces costs, such as energy and time, for finding a new mate. Hormones are important mediators of social behaviours as well as parental care, and endocrine mechanisms are therefore likely to be involved in the decision whether to stay with the same mate or separate after a breeding season. Because behavioural compatibility has been shown to increase fitness and hormones have been shown to regulate behavioural traits, here we examined whether the degree of endocrine similarity is also related to reproductive success and pair bond longevity. We used a 3-year study on free-living great tits, Parus major, to test whether mates had similar hormone levels during the parental phase. We tested specifically whether the metabolic hormone corticosterone was related to pair bond longevity and reproductive success. Baseline, but not stress-induced, corticosterone concentrations were highly correlated among members of a pair and became more similar among members of pairs that stayed together for multiple years. Pairs that increased their hormonal similarity within a season (from pre-breeding to breeding) had the highest reproductive success. Pairs with more similar baseline corticosterone levels and higher reproductive success were also more likely to remain together after the breeding season. The results of this study suggest that pair bond longevity is related to endocrine similarity and reproductive success, and raise the possibility that hormonal mechanisms may be under sexual selection.

AB Increased embryo mortality is the most commonly cited cause of reduced fitness in inbred organisms. Reduced embryo survival may be the result of reduced parental expenditure by inbred individuals and here we tested the hypothesis that inbreeding results in impaired incubation behaviour in captive zebra finches. We compared incubation attentiveness of inbred female zebra finches (derived from full-sibling mating) with that of control females (derived from unrelated parents) and found a statistically significant inbreeding depression of 17% in incubation attentiveness. This shows that inbreeding can significantly influence parental behaviour. Despite a reduction in the amount of time inbred females spent incubating, their partners were able to compensate for the reduced incubation attentiveness. Incubation temperature also did not differ between inbred and control females. To test for the effect of incubation behaviour, we fostered eggs laid by control females to either inbred or control females at the end of laying. Eggs that were incubated by inbred females had an 8.5% lower hatching success than eggs incubated by control females and, although based on a relatively small sample and not statistically significant, the magnitude of the difference was consistent with differences in hatching success observed in the wild under relatively benign environmental conditions. Thus, under more challenging environmental conditions usually encountered in the wild, the reduced incubation attentiveness of inbred females could provide one proximate explanation for the consistent finding of decreased hatching success with increasing maternal inbreeding in birds.

AB Members of the Carnivora employ a wide range of postures and patterns to mark their scent onto objects and thereby communicate with conspecifics. Despite much anecdotal evidence on the marking behaviour of ursids, empirical evidence of scent-marking motor patterns displayed by wild populations is lacking. Analysing the time that different age and sex classes spend at scent-marking trees and the behaviours involved at different times of year could provide further insight into the function of marking. We used camera traps stationed at scent-marking trees to investigate scent-marking behaviour by wild brown bears, Ursus arctos. Through image-based data, we found evidence to support the hypothesis that time investment and scent-marking motor patterns are dictated by the age and sex of the bear. Adult males spent more time scent marking and displayed a more complex behavioural sequence of marking than adult females and juveniles. Adult male behaviour at marking trees was consistent throughout the year, indicating a continued benefit of chemical signalling outside of the breeding season. Juvenile bear behaviour at marking trees changed with age. Young dependent cubs were more likely to imitate their mother's behaviour, whereas older dependent cubs were more likely to engage in marking behaviour independently. The marking motor patterns of independent subadults were more simplistic than those of younger dependent cubs, suggesting a change in behaviour with independence. We suggest that these findings further support the hypothesis that scent-marking behaviour by brown bears functions in intrasexual competition between adult males. Cub behaviour at marking trees suggests an influence of social learning. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Individual variation in physiology and behaviour can have strong effects on ecological and evolutionary processes. Natal habitat, one source of individual variation, can influence individual phenotype, behaviour and fitness through effects on eventual habitat selection. Natal habitat preference induction occurs when individuals match stimuli in their selected habitat to those of their natal habitat. Natal habitat can also affect habitat selection through its influence on body condition (silver spoon effect). We tested for natal habitat preference induction and body-condition-dependent habitat selection in two species with complex life histories, the spotted salamander, Ambystoma maculatum, and the small-mouthed salamander, Ambystoma texanum. We reared salamanders from hatchlings in mesocosms with leaf, grass or control substrate, and tested juvenile habitat selection through two behavioural assays. We found weak evidence of larger salamanders having decreased latency and sampling more habitats, lending support to the body-condition-dependent habitat selection hypothesis in these species. Juveniles preferred grass litter cues regardless of the substrate in their natal mesocosm, suggesting natal habitat preference induction may not occur in species with complex life histories. We propose that species with complex life histories use simple movement rules, such as moving along habitat gradients, to select postnatal habitat when moving through a novel environment.

AB An important component of mate choice is the sex of the potential partner, yet little is known about the factors that cause an individual to pair with the opposite sex. In the current study, we addressed the role of exposure to adult females during development in adult mate choice using a socially monogamous and biparental avian species, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. In our experimental set-up, zebra finch offspring were either raised in the presence of adult males and females in their aviaries (control) or in the absence of all adult females including their mothers (female-deprived). The female-deprived subjects were raised successfully by the male parents and showed no growth deficits compared to controls. When we tested partner preference of control and female-deprived subjects as adults, 57% of males that had been raised without females paired with each other. In contrast, 76% of male offspring that were raised with adults of both sexes paired with females. The most likely interpretation of this dramatic effect on pairing outcome is imprinting on adult males in the aviary in the absence of all adult females. These results thus suggest that sexual imprinting or some other form of social learning is a key developmental process for sexual partner preference in addition to preference for species and individual characteristics.

AB Researchers studying the adaptive significance of behaviour typically assume that genetic mechanisms will not inhibit evolutionary trajectories, an assumption commonly known as the 'phenotypic gambit'. Although the phenotypic gambit continues to be a useful heuristic for behavioural ecology, here we discuss how genomic methods provide new tools and conceptual approaches that are relevant to behavioural ecology. We first describe how the concept of a genetic toolkit for behaviour can allow behavioural ecologists to synthesize both genomic and ecological information when assessing behavioural adaptation. Then we show how gene expression profiles can be viewed as complex phenotypic measurements, used to (1) predict behaviour, (2) evaluate phenotypic plasticity and (3) devise methods to manipulate behaviour in order to test adaptive hypotheses. We propose that advances in genomics and bioinformatics may allow researchers to overcome some of the logistical obstacles that motivated the inception of the phenotypic gambit. Behavioural ecology and genomics are mutually informative, providing potential synergy that could lead to powerful advances in the field of animal behaviour.

AB In recent years, the presence of stable individual variation in animal behaviour has been corroborated by studies across a wide variety of taxa and research disciplines. Reconciliation, or postconflict affiliation between former opponents, is a behavioural domain in which individual differences have not been systematically studied. Using a long-term data set comprising over 2000 conflict and postconflict observations in two groups of outdoor-housed chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, we provide evidence for stable individual variation in reconciliation and test several hypotheses on how this postconflict mechanism relates to social switching behaviour. Results of generalized multilevel models revealed that individual differences remained a substantial source of variation in reconciliation after controlling for a number of situational variables (e. g. the nature of the relationship between opponents) shown by previous research to influence its occurrence. We further demonstrated a positive association between an individual's conciliatory tendency and three separate indices of social switching behaviour, proposing that individual differences in reconciliation may reflect a more fundamental motivation to switch between different social states. In addition to a discussion of potential motivational underpinnings, we provide an impetus for future work to consider how reconciliation relates to the broader constructs and themes identified within animal personality research. To the extent that individual differences in other aspects of conflict and postconflict repertoires exhibit temporal and cross-situational consistency, they too should inform our understanding of animal personalities. Delineating how these and other dimensions of sociality are in part driven by stable individual variation not only has implications for how social interactions themselves unfold, but ultimately for the fitness of the individuals therein.

AB Strong male mate preferences have been documented in species with otherwise conventional sex roles in the laboratory, and across taxa, male preferences generally focus on indicators of female fecundity and sperm competition risk. However, the few field studies of male choice rarely show equally strong effects. This suggests that costs of choice in nature may make the expression of preferences unlikely, or that interacting assessment cues may lead to unpredictable and variable outcomes in the wild. Field studies are therefore critical for testing whether or not male mate choice is sufficiently strong to exert sexual selection on females. Here we examine male choice in nature in response to two experimentally manipulated cues of female reproductive value. We recorded the attraction of male black widow spiders, Latrodectus hesperus, to females in a field enclosure and in a unconstrained natural setting. Stimulus females varied in two ways: sperm competition risk (low-unmated; high-mated) and fecundity (high-fed; low-unfed). Females and their silk were caged to prevent behavioural interactions while allowing the spread of airborne pheromones that attract males. Males in both experiments showed strong, nearly unanimous choice for unmated, well-fed females. In field enclosures, 80% of males made this choice, and wild males made the same choice in 94% of trials. We conclude that male choice in L. hesperus is mediated by detection of airborne pheromones, is strong and consistent despite natural costs of mate searching, and is not affected by natural interactions between (sometimes conflicting) cues of female reproductive value. Thus, universal mate choice may exist among males in nature. We propose general features of systems in which this may be likely and discuss implications for the study of sexual selection on females under conventional sex roles.

AB Birdsong is a culturally transmitted mating signal: young birds learn specific variants of species-specific song(s) from conspecific models. Female song preferences are also learned early in life, but despite the potential functional implications of such learned mating preferences, we still have a poor understanding of when and from whom females learn. This also holds true for one of the foremost models of vocal learning, the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. Both male and female zebra finches memorize their tutor's song motif: as adults, males will sing and females prefer their tutor's song. We here tested whether juvenile females would also learn to prefer the songs of several individuals, and whether the timing and propensity of song preference learning were condition dependent. Young females raised and cross-fostered in experimentally manipulated brood sizes were exposed to several model songs: first their foster father's song until nutritional independence (days 0-35) and then as subadults to playbacks of two different tutor songs (days 35-65). As adults, females preferred all three model songs over unfamiliar songs. There were no interaction effects between females' early rearing conditions (brood size) and preference strength for the different tutor songs. An additional live-tutored group had equally strong preferences for the foster father's song (only heard before day 35) as the tape-tutored females. The combined results demonstrate that subadult females memorize several song types during different times of development and as adults prefer these songs over unfamiliar songs. These findings imply that multiple song learning needs to be taken into account for avian mate choice studies even in species that lack song type repertoires but show individual differences in song.

   IMPACT
AB Ambient noise can mask important acoustic signals used in a variety of communication systems, especially if signals are not adjusted to improve transmission in noise. Nestling birds communicate with their parents using loud begging calls that convey their need for food, but that also attract predators to the nest. Parents can reduce this vulnerability by using alarm calls to silence begging nestlings. Noise could, however, mask alarm calls and increase predation risk, unless parents can adjust their calls to circumvent the noise. Here, we determined whether the response of nestling tree swallows to parental alarm calls is altered in the presence of noise, and whether parents adjust alarm calls in noise to improve call transmission. We found that, in noisy conditions, nestlings continued calling and failed to crouch in the nest in response to parental alarm calls, in contrast to their behaviour in quiet conditions. None of the call features that we measured varied in relation to ambient noise levels at the nest. Our results suggest that noise could interfere with the ability of nestlings to respond appropriately to parental alarm calls and, in turn, could increase predation risk, although further work is needed to test this possibility.

AB Allolactation, the nursing of another female's offspring, occurs most commonly where several females raise young simultaneously in the same nest, but also occurs in singular breeders where nonbreeders also lactate for the offspring of dominant females. In this study, we investigated the factors predicting the frequency of allonursing in meerkats, Suricata suricatta, whether or not subordinate females invest in allonursing, and how much time they invest. Around half of all litters born to dominant females were allonursed. Litters born later were more likely to be allonursed than those born early in the season. Group size, litter size, rainfall and maternal condition were not associated with the likelihood that a litter was allonursed. Subordinate females were more likely to allolactate if they were (or had recently been) pregnant. This effect was stronger if they were also highly related to the litter's mother, suggesting that females may gain indirect benefits from allolactating. Older females and those that had recently returned to the group following eviction were also more likely to allolactate. Females nursed for longer periods if they were in good condition, and invested more time if the litter was large or if the litter mother was in poor condition. We suggest that allolactation generates a combination of direct and indirect benefits. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The proportion of sexually receptive males in relation to females (operational sex ratio, OSR) is often invoked as an important determinant of the potential for sexual selection. Although the opportunity for sexual selection metric (I-s) is frequently used to estimate such potential, recent doubts have been cast about its capacity to disentangle the relative effect of sexual competition from that of random matings with increasing bias in OSR. To address this, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate whether the potential for sexual selection in males increases as OSR becomes more male biased and to estimate the relative effects of random matings and sexual competition on this relationship. We performed the analyses using two data sets (one with Is values and one with I-dif values, which estimate how far mate monopolization deviates from the minimum possible for each population). We found that the relationship between OSR and Is varied from positive to neutral, while Idif was unrelated to OSR variation. This indicates that variation in reproductive success among individuals due to random matings or sexual competition is not influenced by OSR. However, when the correlation between OSR and Is was positive, random matings appeared to be important in Is estimations. Perhaps the responses of males and females differ from species to species as OSR becomes more male biased, disrupting the relationship between OSR and Is when species are pooled.

AB Parental care is beneficial for offspring, but costly for parents. Thus, it seems maladaptive to care for unrelated offspring unless the additional offspring provide direct benefits to the carer's own offspring or discrimination costs are high. Females of the European earwig, Forficula auricularia, provide maternal care for their own offspring ( nymphs), but also for foreign nymphs that join their brood. Nymphs preferentially kill and cannibalize nonsiblings and individuals that are smaller or in poor condition. Here, we tested the effects of nymph condition and food availability on brood mixing in F. auricularia. We experimentally manipulated nymph condition by feeding or food depriving groups of unrelated nymphs. The resident groups remained with their mothers whereas the mothers were removed from the foreign groups. Since nymph condition determines the direction of cannibalism, we hypothesized that brood mixing is dependent on nymph condition and food availability in the environment. Our results show that brood mixing was initially driven by condition-dependent effects on nymph activity, and later by the fed foreigners invading resident broods, suggesting that foreigners control brood mixing, independent of food availability. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the dynamics of brood mixing are condition dependent, possibly mediated by corresponding cannibalism threats.

AB Left-right behavioural biases are well documented across the animal kingdom, and handedness has long been associated with cognitive performance. However, the relationship between body laterality and cognitive ability is poorly understood. The embryonic pathways dictating normal left-right patterning have been molecularly dissected in model vertebrates, and numerous genetic and pharmacological treatments now facilitate experimental randomization or reversal of the left-right axis in these animals. Several recent studies showed a link between brain asymmetry and strongly lateralized behaviours such as eye use preference. However, links between laterality of the body and performance on cognitive tasks utilizing non-lateralized cues remain unknown. Xenopus tadpoles are an established model for the study of early left-right patterning, and protocols were recently developed to quantitatively evaluate learning and memory in these animals. Using an automated testing and training platform, we tested wild-type, left-right-randomized and left-right-reversed tadpoles for their ability to learn colour cues in an automated assay. Our results indicate that animals with either randomization or reversal of somatic left-right patterning learned more slowly than wild-type siblings, although all groups were able to reach the same performance optimum given enough training sessions. These results are the first analysis of the link between body laterality and learning of nonlateralized cues, and they position the Xenopus tadpole as an attractive and tractable model for future studies of the links between asymmetry of the body, lateralization of the brain and behaviour.

AB One widely acknowledged benefit of group living is an increase in the efficiency of predator avoidance. Experiments have demonstrated a variety of mechanisms involved, such as 'the selfish herd'. In this experiment we exposed groups of two-spot astyanax, Astyanax bimaculatus, to three predatory stimuli ('active search', 'avian pecking' and 'sit-and-wait') and one nonpredatory control stimulus. In response to these stimuli we found that fish were more likely to chase and attack a group member when exposed to an active search predator model. This response was not observed for the control or the other predators. This response could reduce an individual's predation risk by making the other (i.e. the attacked) individual more vulnerable to predation. We showed that this trait was an innate response and as such a result of natural selection rather than a learning process. This study shows how group living may result in active selfishness, an additional cost of group living. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In scramble competition mating systems, individual behaviours related to male-male competition are expected to be plastic across sociosexual environments. However, the evolutionary forces that shape individual differences in behavioural plasticity remain poorly understood. We measured behaviour associated with scramble competition in male water striders, Tenagogerris euphrosyne, in two social contexts. Male T. euphrosyne tend to mount other individuals or pairs indiscriminately and then dismount if their target is either another male or a mating pair. We measured the speed with which a focal male dismounted (i.e. his sensitivity to having made an inappropriate mounting) in each of these contexts. We quantified temporal consistency of dismount speed within each context, as well as individual variation in behavioural plasticity across contexts. We then estimated the effect of the behaviour and of plasticity on individual fitness in different sex ratio conditions. We found that individuals differed in their recognition sensitivity traits, and also in how plastic their sensitivity (i.e. dismount speed) was to context (mating status or sex). When we measured the mating success of each male within experimental groups kept at four different sex ratios, recognition sensitivity traits in both contexts interacted to influence mating success, and there were significant differences in linear selection on sensitivity traits between sex ratio treatments. We discuss how insensitive males evolve, and how individual variation in behavioural plasticity could be maintained by selection or environmental variability.

AB Aggression is important in the life history of most vertebrate species and influences ecological and social relationships by regulating the dynamics of territoriality, hierarchy, predation and resource utilization. The expression of aggressive behaviour develops as an individual ages and is often shaped by social experience. Even though the heritability of traits that yield dominant-subordinate relationships is high, strong environmental influences also shape the expression of these individual behaviours. In this study we present evidence for the first time of a necessary interplay between factors that generate behavioural phenotypic plasticity in zebrafish. Select presumptively genetic and environmental elements interacted developmentally to produce the behavioural phenotypes necessary for dominant-subordinate relationships in dyads. Aggressive and submissive acts increased in focus and intensity and were correlated with social rank during development, but decreased with duration of the paired interaction.

AB Animals communicate with conspecifics to resolve conflicts over how resources are shared. Since signals reflect individuals' resource-holding potential and motivation to compete, it is crucial that opponents efficiently transmit and receive information to adjust investment optimally in competitive interactions. Acoustic communication is particularly flexible as it can be quickly modulated according to background noise and audience. Diverse mechanisms have evolved to minimize acoustic signal interference, one being the avoidance of signal overlap by adjusting the timing of call production to alternate calls with those of competitors. However, the occurrence and function of overlap avoidance in the resolution of competition among relatives have barely been studied. Using young barn owl siblings, Tyto alba, which vocally negotiate over who will have priority access to food provided by parents, we investigated the extent to which nestlings avoid calling simultaneously and the function of this behaviour. We found that nestlings overlapped both their live siblings' calls and experimentally broadcast calls at least five times less often than expected at random. Furthermore, a focal nestling engaged more intensely in vocal negotiation when competing with nestmates that called simultaneously compared to those that did not overlap their respective calls. This suggests that barn owl nestlings avoid calling simultaneously, as overlapped calls are less efficient at deterring siblings from competing. Overlap avoidance reduces signal interference and, as a consequence, would improve the efficiency of communication among kin. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The intense arousal and excitement shown by adult male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, during territorial attacks on other chimpanzees and predation upon monkeys suggest that similar psychological mechanisms may be involved. Specifically, it has been proposed that hunting behaviour in chimpanzees evolved from intraspecies aggression. Over 32 years, chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania were significantly more likely to engage in a territorial border patrol on days when they hunted red colobus monkeys (Procolobus spp.), and vice versa, even after statistically controlling for male chimpanzee party size. We test the hypothesis that this correlation arises because hunting and patrolling are components of a species-level aggressive behavioural syndrome; specifically that predation arose as a by-product of territorial aggression in this species. However, hunting was equally likely to occur after a patrol and/or an intergroup interaction as it was before, and the occurrence of an intergroup interaction in which the chimpanzees approached strangers did not increase subsequent hunting probability. We also reject the hypothesis that hunting and patrolling reflect an individual-level behavioural syndrome. We identified two 'impact hunters' whose presence increased hunting probability. Similarly, there were also three 'impact patrollers', who increased the likelihood that a visit to the periphery of the community range resulted in a patrol. While this discovery has important implications for our understanding of the proximate causes of cooperation, it does not explain the temporal correlation between patrolling and hunting, since no males had such an impact in both contexts. Instead, the data suggest that the correlation arose because patrols typically involved males travelling long distances, which increased the probability of encountering prey. Additionally, parties that travelled to the periphery were more likely to encounter colobus in woodland, where hunts are more likely to occur and to succeed. Therefore, we conclude that ecological, rather than psychological, factors promote the co-occurrence of hunting and territorial aggression in this species.

AB Predators that have learned to associate warning coloration with toxicity often continue to include aposematic prey in their diet in order to gain the nutrients and energy that they contain. As body size is widely reported to correlate with energetic content, we predicted that prey size would affect predators' decisions to eat aposematic prey. We used a well-established system of wild-caught European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, foraging on mealworms, Tenebrio molitor, to test how the size of undefended (water-injected) and defended (quinine-injected) prey, on different coloured backgrounds, affected birds' decisions to eat defended prey. We found that birds ate fewer defended prey, and less quinine, when undefended prey were large compared with when they were small, but that the size of the defended prey had no effect on the numbers eaten. Consequently, we found no evidence that the mass of the defended prey or the overall mass of prey ingested affected the amount of toxin that a predator was willing to ingest, and instead the mass of undefended prey eaten was more important. This is a surprising finding, challenging the assumptions of state-dependent models of aposematism and mimicry, and highlighting the need to understand better the mechanisms of predator decision making. In addition, the birds did not learn to discriminate visually between defended and undefended prey based on size, but only on the basis of colour. This suggests that colour signals may be more salient to predators than size differences, allowing Batesian mimics to benefit from aposematic models even when they differ in size.

AB Sociality can be beneficial for individuals because it may increase access to resources, provide greater protection from predators and create opportunities for mating. In some species, social conditions and experience also influence the physiology and behavioural responses of individuals. Although social facilitation of sexual maturation is poorly understood in insects, the German cockroach has served as an important model system for this phenomenon as group-housed females mature faster than solitary females. However, social modulation of male reproduction has not been investigated in this or any other nonpolyphenic insect species. We investigated the relative effects of social interactions and isolation on endocrine, reproductive and behavioural events during sexual maturation of B. germanica males. Results show that social interactions significantly facilitate juvenile hormone biosynthesis as well as protein production by the accessory reproductive glands, whereas isolation suppresses these processes. Other processes, such as accumulation of cuticular hydrocarbons, maturation of the male's courtship readiness and his readiness to copulate, appear to be relatively independent of social experience. However, both courtship and copulation latencies declined with age more in socially paired males than in isolated males. Our study is the first to reveal that social interactions have a profound effect on certain aspects of male reproductive physiology and behaviour in an insect species that does not exhibit phase or developmental polyphenism.

AB Reconciliation is the occurrence of friendly behaviour between opponents shortly after an aggressive conflict. In primate groups, reconciliation reduces aggression and postconflict arousal. Aggression within a group can also increase arousal of bystanders (e.g. increase bystanders' rates of self-directed behaviour). Since reconciliation reduces aggression between opponents, we tested whether it also reduces self-directed behaviour in bystanders. Following aggression in a captive group of hamadryas baboons, one observer conducted a focal sample on one of the combatants to document reconciliation and a second observer simultaneously conducted a focal sample on a randomly selected bystander. Matched control observations were then collected on the same individuals in a nonaggressive context to obtain baseline levels of behaviour. The self-directed behaviour of bystanders was elevated after witnessing a fight compared to baseline levels. If combatants reconciled aggression, bystander rates of self-directed behaviour significantly decreased. If combatants did not reconcile aggression, bystander rates of self-directed behaviour remained at elevated levels, significantly higher than after reconciliation. If combatants affiliated with partners other than their original opponent, bystander rates of self-directed behaviour did not decrease. The rate of bystander self-directed behaviour after a combatant affiliated with its opponent was significantly lower than the rate after a combatant affiliated with other animals. Witnessing aggression increased arousal in bystanders, and reconciliation between the combatants was accompanied by reduced bystander arousal. The reduction was specific to contexts in which former opponents interacted. We suggest that bystanders recognized the functional significance of this conflict-resolution mechanism when it occurred in their group. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Same-sex sexual behaviour is widespread across taxa and is particularly common in insects, in which up to 50% of copulation attempts by males are directed towards other males in some species. Research effort has focused on male-male same-sex behaviour and the prevailing theory is that benefits of high mating rate combined with poor sex discrimination explain the high incidence of male-male mounting. However, the evolution of female-female mounting is more enigmatic, since females typically do not mount males in order to mate. Using a full-sib design, we found an intersexual correlation for same-sex mounting in the beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. Variation in male-male mounting across families explained over 20% of variation in female-female mounting. Moreover, we found no evidence that same-sex behaviour was related to general activity level in either sex or carried a fitness cost to females. Taken together, our results suggest that female-female mounting is a relatively low-cost behaviour that may be maintained in the population via selection on males.

AB Innovation has been defined as a solution to a novel problem or a novel solution to an old problem. The second part of this definition requires the inhibition of previously learnt solution strategies before a novel solution can be found. Therefore, inventing novel solutions for an old problem is considered to be particularly difficult. We investigated the ability of great apes to produce multiple new solutions to a task after each of those solutions became obsolete. We presented all four nonhuman great ape species with a task consisting of extracting a food reward from a puzzle box. Initially, the task could be solved in three different ways that varied in difficulty. After subjects discovered the first solution, we allowed them to use it for some trials and then it became obsolete. If the apes could overcome their initial response and find the next solution, we again allowed them to use it for some time and once again it became obsolete. The final step consisted of finding the third solution to secure the food reward. We found that all species except orang-utans, Pongo abelii, were able to solve all versions of the problem. Furthermore, they overcame the obsolete techniques quickly and efficiently, indicating high degrees of behavioural flexibility and inhibitory control. In contrast to previous research on social learning, our results suggest that great apes are not conservative and adjust their behaviour flexibly when the physical constraints of a task change.

AB Scent marking is a common behaviour used to delineate territories by carnivores, yet it remains insufficiently understood as there are several alternative hypotheses, one being that sites are marked where resources are abundant, thus guaranteeing their exclusive use. Small Mediterranean rivers are highly variable environments throughout the year, representing an ideal scenario to test this theory, as prey availability changes as a function of the spatial and temporal variability of the flow regime. We studied seasonal variation in the habitat selection of latrine (i.e. scent-marked) sites, prey availability and prey selection of the Eurasian otter, Lutra lutra, between two contrasting fluvial systems, the regulated mainstem of River Bullaque and four unregulated tributaries (River Guadiana basin, central Spain). In 2010, we measured habitat variables, collected otter spraints and used electrofishing to compare the diet with prey abundance. Latrines were more frequent at shallow sites, and otters did not discriminate between fluvial systems across seasons. Also, latrines were associated with sites where the main prey, the calandino, Squalius alburnoides, was more abundant in the tributaries during spring and summer. However, this abundance was not translated into prey selection, with calandino being preyed below its availability in the mainstem. This observation suggests that otters mark places where fishing is especially easy (i.e. shallow sites with proportionally more fish). Calandino was substituted by red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, which was easier to catch but of lower energetic value, where higher water levels made fishing more difficult (i.e. the regulated mainstem).

AB We investigated the possibility of reproductive interference between two sibling spider species, Paratrechalea azul and Paratrechalea ornata, which occur syntopically and reproduce synchronously. Males of both species offer a nuptial gift composed of prey wrapped in silk to females. Through laboratory experiments, we evaluated possible asymmetries in the outcome of heterospecific encounters between males and females, and investigated whether chemical signalling could function as a premating barrier between the two species. Males of P. azul were unable to discriminate conspecific from heterospecific female draglines, which resulted in wasted time and energy in nuptial gift construction. Males of P. ornata incurred a higher cost for discrimination mistakes because most of them were attacked by heterospecific females; 95% lost the nuptial gift upon the attack and 33% were preyed upon. This pattern is probably a consequence of differences in body size between males and females of each species. Both species showed erroneous female choice, but only P. ornata females courted heterospecific males, which are considerably larger than conspecific males and may resemble high-quality mating partners. Males of P. ornata also made discrimination mistakes, but at a much lower frequency compared to P. azul males. The selective pressure for precise recognition of conspecific female signs is probably stronger on P. ornata males because misdirected courtship may increase their chances of encountering predatory heterospecific females. This study provides the first detailed evidence of reproductive interference between two reproductively isolated spider species, showing that the costs paid by individuals of different sexes and different species are highly asymmetric.

AB Fitness costs imposed by the common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, on its hosts select for host defences such as nest defence and egg discrimination. The efficiency of both types of defence varies among host species, host populations and even seasonally within a host population. We examined changes in egg recognition as defence against cuckoo parasitism in the rufous-tailed scrub robin, Cercotrichas galactotes, both seasonally and over a decade. The rejection rate decreased from 64.7% to zero within 10 years following the cuckoos' disappearance from the area. In this host species, egg recognition without rejection had previously been reported and in this study, using nonmimetic model eggs, we found that, in the absence of cuckoos, females lost their motivation to reject despite maintaining their discrimination capacity. During presentations of dummy cuckoos and other species, rufous-tailed scrub robins did not recognize the female cuckoo dummy as an enemy and its presentation near the host nest did not increase egg rejection, the rejection rate remaining very similar regardless of the dummy species placed near the nest. We suggest that other cues such as the sight of cuckoos flying across the breeding area or directly to the nest are responsible for a fine-tuned assessment of the risk of parasitism in this host species. The sharp decrease in rejection rates according to perceived risk of parasitism reported here reflects phenotypic plasticity, an adaptive mechanism that enables animals to adjust their behaviour to a rapidly changing environment.

AB Despite their importance for understanding predatoreprey interactions, factors that affect predator evasion behaviours of offspring of large ungulates are poorly understood. Our objective was to characterize the influence of selection and availability of escape cover and maternal presence on predator evasion by white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, fawns in the northern Great Plains, U. S. A. We observed 45 coyote, Canis latrans, chases of fawns, and we participated in 83 human chases of fawns during 2007-2009, of which, 19 and 42 chases, respectively, ended with capture of the fawn. Evasive techniques used by fawns were similar for human and coyote chases. Likelihood of a white-tailed deer fawn escaping capture, however, was influenced by deer group size and a number of antipredator behaviours, including aggressive defence by females, initial habitat and selection of escape cover, all of which were modified by the presence of parturient females. At the initiation of a chase, fawns in grasslands were more likely to escape, whereas fawns in forested cover, cultivated land or wheat were more likely to be captured by a coyote or human. Fawns fleeing to wetlands and grasslands also were less likely to be captured compared with those choosing forested cover, wheat and cultivated land. Increased probability of capture was associated with greater distance to wetland and grassland habitats and decreased distance to wheat. Use of wetland habitat as a successful antipredator strategy highlights the need for a greater understanding of the importance of habitat complexity in predator avoidance.

AB Colour is a cue that animals can use to categorize rewards and may be particularly important to nectarivores, which forage on flowers that vary in hue. Here, we investigated whether colour facilitated the learning of the properties of artificial flowers in free-living rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus. Whereas refill rates and sucrose concentrations of flowers were readily learned, we could not detect in the birds' performance an effect of colour on the learning of either floral property. As these results seem unlikely to have been the result of a ceiling effect or an inability to perceive colour variation, we suggest they are due to overshadowing. This apparently counterintuitive result, where birds do not attend to what appears to be a very prominent cue, is consistent with evidence that hummingbirds pay more attention to space than to colour.

ID MARINE PREDATOR; MOTHS; ODOR
AB Viswanathan et al.'s (1996,Nature,381,413-415) analysis of the flight patterns of the wandering albatross, Diomedea exulans, led to an explosion of interest in biological Levy flights and to an accumulation of evidence that a wide variety of animals have movement patterns that can be approximated by Levy flights. Subsequently, it became apparent that the analysis of Viswanathan et al. ( 1996) was seriously flawed. Attributing Levy flights to wandering albatrosses now appeared to be an error that nevertheless served as the basis for new insights into animal behaviour. Here I revisit the issue in light of recent evidence that fishy-scented odours facilitate prey location in these birds. Using a simple mathematical argument I show that the touchdown locations (positions of the located odour sources) of odour-mediated anemotactic (upwind) flight patterns form a Levy 'dust'. Levy flight patterns are therefore predicted to be an emergent property of olfactory searching in turbulent environments. In accordance with the reanalysis of the empirical data, flight lengths are predicted to be gamma distributed when prey lying in nearby crosswind locations can occasionally be detected by purely visual means. These predictions are supported by the results of numerical simulations. The finding invites a further re-examination of the flight patterns of the wandering albatross and provides new insights into the movement patterns of many animals that can locate odour sources in turbulent environments.

AB Understanding the causes and consequences of avian dispersal is important since dispersal movements may influence individuals' survival and reproductive success. Although obligate interspecific brood parasitism has obvious detrimental effects for its avian host, few empirical studies have addressed the question of how brood parasitism may influence host dispersal. We studied factors affecting, and consequences of, natal and breeding dispersal movements in a population of magpies, Pica pica, parasitized by the great spotted cuckoo, Clamator glandarius, by monitoring dispersal of individuals and cuckoo parasitism over 6 years. Recruitment probability increased with fledging weight and was higher for individuals hatching early in the breeding season. Heaviest recruits at fledging settled closer to their natal nests and bred in more saturated sites within the study area. Natal dispersal distance did not predict the magpie's productivity or risk of cuckoo parasitism in its first reproductive attempt. Females and parasitized males decreased their breeding dispersal distance when breeding close to other pairs, whereas nonparasitized males breeding close to other pairs dispersed more in subsequent years. Females, but not males, breeding closer to their previous breeding places had larger clutches than those breeding further away. Dispersing longer or shorter distances between breeding attempts had no consequences in terms of cuckoo parasitism avoidance for magpies. Our results suggest a minor role of great spotted cuckoo parasitism on magpie dispersal movements at the spatial scale analysed. Instead, our study revealed density-dependent dispersal in our parasitized magpie population. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The zebra finch is the model species for the study of the evolution of birdsong, female song preferences, song learning and the neural processes underlying song learning and production. Despite this, almost all work to date in these fields has focused on domesticated zebra finches in captivity and remarkably little is known about song preferences, or the reproductive success of males with different songs, in wild populations. In this study we tested, for the first time in a wild zebra finch population, whether a male's song structure predicts his reproductive success. We recorded male songs in a nestbox population. Males from this wild population sang longer songs, with a higher peak frequency, than domesticated males. The number of each male's offspring that survived until day 12 posthatching (a proxy for fledging success) was used as a measure of reproductive success. Nestlings were partially cross-fostered, allowing us to disentangle the indirect effects of male genetic quality or maternal effects from those of direct benefits such as parental care. Male song structure predicted the number of genetic offspring surviving, as well as hatching success, but not the number or size of eggs in a clutch. Song structure did not predict the number of unrelated foster-offspring that survived. These results provide the first evidence that differences in male song can predict differences in reproductive success in the zebra finch, and suggest that differences in genetic quality are responsible, rather than differences in parental care or maternal investment in the eggs.

AB Identifying the cognitive challenges of sociality can be difficult because similar social interactions may be based on very different cognitive mechanisms. To better understand the cognitive mechanisms associated with a particular interaction, we investigated the social information that gelada, Theropithecus gelada, bachelors use to assess rival males. Gelada bachelors may use a variety of assessment strategies, including attending to simple cues of immanent mating opportunities, vocal quality signals, and monitoring relationships between attached males and females. Our observational data indicate that bachelors preferentially eavesdrop on maleemale fights (over copulations) and maintain close proximity to units that have experienced a recent take-over. As such units also experience elevated rates of fighting and extrapair copulations, bachelors appear to attend to cues of mating opportunities. Furthermore, bachelors monitor vocal contests between rival males, suggesting they are able to remember the quality displayed by competitors. Finally, we used playback experiments to simulate copulations between breeding males and 'their' females (control) or other females (test) and found no difference in bachelor response, suggesting a lack of knowledge about third-party relationships between males and females. In contrast to other social primates, gelada bachelors appear to use simpler information, such as outcomes of maleemale competition, when assessing others. Given the size of gelada communities (>1000 individuals), the costs of monitoring third-party relationships may outweigh the benefits of obtaining this information, particularly when simpler rules of thumb are available.

AB In a wide variety of taxa, males are equipped with harmful structures on their genitalia such as hooks, barbs or spines. The proximate function of these structures and the evolutionary forces behind their evolution have been discussed and investigated during the last few decades. One model system in which these structures have attracted particular attention is the Callosobruchus seed beetle group. The main suggestion for the occurrence of genital spines in this group of species has been that their primary function is to act as an anchor during mating, to aid the male in staying attached to the female. This would prevent females terminating copulation prematurely, or would hinder take-overs by rival males. We used five populations of Callosobruchus seed beetles, with differing lengths of the male genital spines, to test whether longer spines provide males with an enhanced attachment during mating. This was tested both with and without male competition in the form of rival males present or not during focal copulations. We found that males from populations with longer spines did not stay in copula for longer than males from populations with shorter spines. In addition, females mating with males with longer genital spines suffered a fitness cost in terms of lower lifetime offspring production. In conclusion, we did not find any support for the hypothesis that the primary function of genital spines in seed beetles is to serve as an anchor.

We tested a prediction of the risk allocation hypothesis in which allocation to antipredator behaviours will depend on temporal variation in perceived risk. Individuals are predicted to allocate heightened antipredator behaviours to brief infrequent periods of high risk, but with increasing frequency of high-risk periods, individuals will invest less in these behaviours. We tested this prediction using pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, breeding at different distances from sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, nests. Sparrowhawk encounters are assumed to be frequent near hawk nests and decrease with distance away from them. Parent risk taking was measured as the time taken to resume nestling feeding after a period of increased risk. We found that the time to resume nestling feeding was associated with distance from sparrowhawk nests, supporting the paradox prediction of the risk allocation hypothesis. Flycatcher parents breeding near nesting sparrowhawks displayed weak antipredator allocation to a focal high-risk encounter. In contrast, flycatcher parents nesting further away increased their allocation to antipredator behaviour and showed long delays to resume nestling feeding. Our results highlight a natural setting in which risk allocation can be applied. Via encounter rates, central-place-foraging predators create perceived predation risk gradients that may lead to predictable antipredator responses in nature, especially when the prey is sedentary.

AB Kokanee salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, can vary in their maturation status at arrival to spawning areas and in their subsequent behaviour. In Meadow Creek, British Columbia, typical 'red-arriving' females arrive with red nuptial coloration, spawn within a few days, and then defend their nests against digup by conspecifics. In contrast, atypical 'silver-arriving' females arrive with scales still present and delay maturation and spawning by 3-4 weeks. Our objective was to further describe the silver-and red-arriving phenotypes and to test the hypothesis that they are proxies for a dimorphism of life cycle variation. Colour was a good indicator of a female's stage of maturity and senescence because silver-arriving females had larger guts, larger and fattier livers, and smaller eggs containing less lean mass than red-arriving females. Colour, and therefore maturity status, covaried with life history traits: silver-arriving females were younger (in 2008 and 2009) and smaller (in 2008) than red-arriving females. The percentage of silver-arriving females was higher in 2009 (11.4%) than in 2008 (2.2%), possibly because of poor conditions for growth in 2009. We also observed some silver-arriving males, but they were much rarer (0.4% in 2008 and 1.5% in 2009). Scores on the first discriminant function based on colour information from digital photographs distinguished silver-arriving and red-arriving females. At the population level, these scores were bimodally distributed, but the dip between modes did not clearly separate silver-and red-arriving females. Although silver-and red-arriving phenotypes represent female reproductive tactics for delivering parental care, they are not distinct alternatives and instead represent the extremes of life cycle variation in this population.

AB Game theory predicts that individuals should assess numbers of potential opponents before engaging in aggressive interactions, particularly when numerical odds can determine outcomes of such interactions. Spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, live in fission-fusion societies in which extreme numerical imbalances can occur during intergroup conflicts, which are potentially lethal. Thus, an ability to assess relative numbers of opponents should be highly advantageous in this species. Here we tested abilities of wild spotted hyaenas to assess numerical advantage with a playback experiment by presenting contact calls produced by one, two or three unknown hyaenas, or 'intruders', to individuals in our study clans. Hyaenas conformed to predictions of game theory by increasing vigilance to playbacks of multiple unfamiliar intruders. Furthermore, hyaenas distinguished not just between calls produced by one versus multiple intruders, but showed a fine-grained ability to assess numerical advantage, and they responded with increasing levels of vigilance to calls produced by one, two and three unknown intruders. Hyaenas also took more risks by approaching the speaker when they outnumbered calling intruders. Lastly, this study provides experimental evidence that spotted hyaenas can use contact calls to distinguish among individuals. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Unlike many species that are 'occasional' cannibals, the tadpoles of cane toads specifically target conspecific eggs for consumption, ignoring the eggs of sympatric frog species (at least within the toads' current invasive range in Australia). We tested three hypotheses as to the benefits of consuming conspecific eggs: transfer of toxins from eggs (which have high toxin content) to tadpoles (which have lower toxin content), nutritional input, and reduction of future competition. We found no evidence of toxin transfer, but eggs contained sufficient nutrition for cannibalistic tadpoles to develop through to metamorphosis, and egg consumption enhanced rates of tadpole growth and differentiation through reduction of subsequent competition from younger tadpoles. Features of the cane toads' life history (e. g. synchronized deposition and development of all eggs within a clutch; delay between hatching and onset of feeding; short larval stage relative to interclutch interval of a given adult female) mean that the cannibals are unlikely to be close relatives of the younger conspecifics they consume (either as eggs or as metamorphs). Kin selection may thus favour rather than oppose cannibalism. The end result is that cannibalistic toad tadpoles benefit through nutrition and reduced future competition, with little collateral risk of eating their own siblings. Another potential cost of cannibalism (risk of disease transmission) may be minimal in this system, because the eggs are unlikely to contain pathogens (reflecting their brief embryonic periods and protective jelly layers). The combination of these forces has favoured the evolution of targeted cannibalism by cane toad tadpoles. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Factors that influence the strength of sexual selection within a population may have important consequences for the evolution and maintenance of reproductive isolation between populations. Here we examine the role of one such factor, predation risk, in influencing female permissiveness for heterospecific advertisement calls. Specifically, we tested the effect of simulated predation risk on mate choice in female tungara frogs, Physalaemus pustulosus, using variation in ambient light levels, travel time and the presence of auditory cues of local predators. Simulated predation risk increased female permissiveness for advertisement calls along an artificial gradient of calls intermediate between conspecifics and a congener, Physalaemus enesefae. Across the entire gradient, the presence of auditory cues of the predatory frog Leptodactylus pentadactylus in association with the conspecific call dramatically increased the likelihood of females choosing the intermediate call. In addition, higher ambient light levels and simulation of increased travel distances both increased the likelihood that females would choose intermediate calls over conspecific calls. These results suggest that, although mate choice may be important in causing reproductive isolation between allopatric populations, spatial or temporal variation in predation risk may strongly influence the expression of mate choice and thus the outcome of secondary contact.

ID EXPLOITATION; RISK; LIFE
AB While superstitions appear maladaptive, they may be the inevitable result of an adaptive causal learning mechanism that simultaneously reduces the risk of two types of errors: the error of failing to exploit an existing causal relationship and the error of trying to exploit a nonexistent causal relationship. An individual's explorationeexploitation strategy is a key component of managing this trade-off. In particular, on any given trial, the individual must decide whether to give the action that maximizes its expected fitness based on current information (exploit) or to give the action that provides the most information about the true nature of the causal relationship (explore). We present a version of this 'two-armed bandit' problem that allows us to identify the optimal explorationeexploitation strategy, and to determine how various parameters affect the probability that an individual will develop a superstition. We find that superstitions are more likely when the cost of the superstition is low relative to the perceived benefits, and when the individual's prior beliefs suggest that the superstition is true. Furthermore, we find that both the total number of learning trials available, and the nature of the individual's uncertainty affect the probability of superstition, but that the nature of these effects depends on the individual's prior beliefs.

AB Episodic memory has been described as the ability to recall personal past events, involving what, where and when an event has been experienced. Cognitive abilities like learning and memory are pivotal to the performance of many behavioural traits such as food procurement. Nectar, the primary food of hummingbirds, is dispersed in hundreds of flowers and varies in concentration and renewal rate. Therefore, a hummingbird that can remember elements of episodic-like memory such as what, where and when the nectar becomes available will have a higher energy rate of intake when compared to random foraging. We conducted a field experiment with green-backed firecrown hummingbirds, Sephanoides sephaniodes. We assessed the ability to recall the location, nectar quality and renewal rate of the most rewarding flowers among several less rewarding flowers with identical visual cues. Hummingbirds were able to remember the most profitable nectar sources and flower position and adjust their visits to nectar renewal interval. Cognitive performance varied among individuals, implying up to 6.3-fold differences in energy gain. Our results strongly suggest that hummingbirds use cognitive abilities to exploit nectar sources efficiently and, therefore, that cognitive abilities are potentially tied to survival probability.

AB Although environmental conditions and biotic interactions are widely recognized as key sources of variation in circadian activity rhythms of a broad array of vertebrates, information on their actual significance outside experimental settings remains scarce. We investigated changes in circadian activity rhythms of free-ranging Cabrera voles, Microtus cabrerae, and water voles, Arvicola sapidus, in highly seasonal Mediterranean environments, and analysed how such changes were further affected by intersexual and interspecific interactions. Cabrera voles were largely diurnal, with a unimodal peak around midday during the wet season, whereas during the dry season activity was reduced during the hot midday period and increased strongly at dawn and dusk. Water voles also had a marked bimodal crepuscular pattern during the dry season, but this was much attenuated during the wet season, when they were comparatively more diurnal. Activity patterns varied little between the sexes, although with a tendency for higher overall activity by male Cabrera voles (dry season only) and water voles, possibly because of intersexual interactions involving seasonal shifts from monogamy to facultative polygyny in Cabrera voles, and year-round polygyny in water vole. Within each season, Cabrera voles appeared to change their activity patterns in the presence of water voles, reducing overall activity and shifting activity peaks towards diurnal (dry season) or crepuscular (wet season) time periods less used by water voles. Overall, this study provides evidence for the strong role of seasonal changes in environmental conditions and interspecific interactions in driving variation in the activity patterns of Mediterranean voles under natural conditions.

AB Parental care is a convergent trait shown by a broad range of taxa. Often, successful parents must balance multiple developmental variables (e. g. embryonic water balance and thermoregulation). Pythons have recently emerged as valuable parental care models because females show simple egg-brooding behaviours that significantly influence variables of widespread importance (i.e. embryonic predation, hydration, temperature and respiration). Nest site selection is an important parental behaviour that has been shown to enhance several developmental variables in numerous taxa. In pythons, where brooding can substantially mitigate environmental conditions to enhance the developmental environment, it is unclear to what extent females utilize environmental cues in selecting their nest site. Thus, we determined whether nest humidity and temperature influence python nest site selection because these variables influence python egg-brooding behaviour and are strongly associated with offspring fitness. We created a radial maze with three nest site options: O(TH): optimal temperature (31.5 degrees C) and humidity (23 g/m(3) H(2)O), as determined by previous studies; O(T): optimal temperature, suboptimal humidity (13 g/m(3) H(2)O); OH: suboptimal temperature (25 degrees C) and optimal humidity. We monitored the locations of female Children's pythons, Antaresia childreni, during gravidity, at oviposition and when nonreproductive. Females significantly preferred O(TH) over O(T) and O(H) during both reproductive stages; yet, female choice was not significantly different from random when females were nonreproductive. These results, when considered with previous results, demonstrate that female pythons sense environmental temperature and humidity and use this information at multiple time points (i.e. during gravidity, at oviposition and during egg brooding) to enhance the developmental environment of their offspring.

AB Animals may acquire information about predatory threats via direct cues, clues from the predator, or indirect cues from predator-elicited alarm signals from conspecifics. Although direct detection of a predator is assumed to be a better indicator of risk, only three previous studies have directly contrasted the relative information content of conspecific alarm calls to predator sounds. Studied species typically reacted equally or stronger to conspecific alarm calls than to predator sounds, suggesting that an indirect cue may be a more reliable indicator of risk. We studied zenaida doves', Zenaida aurita, responsiveness to predator sounds and conspecific alarm signals. When flushed, zenaida doves produced voluntary mechanical wing whistles, which we predicted to be alarm signals. Observing responses to wing flap playbacks with and without whistles, we found that doves increased vigilance significantly more to wing whistles than to wing flaps without whistles or control playbacks. These results indicate that conspecifics interpret wing whistles as alarm signals. We then conducted another playback experiment, which demonstrated that red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis, playbacks elicited higher levels of dove vigilance than conspecific wing whistles. Contrary to other species, zenaida doves seemingly consider predator vocalizations more informative than conspecific alarm signals. Therefore, the reliability of acoustic signals associated with predation risk may strongly influence prey responsiveness to direct and indirect cues.

AB Specialization by predators, parasites and parasitoids is often viewed as adaptive because specialization will usually increase search efficiency for suitable hosts (prey). Although many studies have documented interspecific variation in the degree of host specialization, few studies have examined intraspecific variation in specialization among different populations exploiting different numbers of hosts, and even fewer have specifically examined variation in behavioural specialization. Here we examine the acoustic preferences of a parasitoid fly, Ormia ochracea, which attacks several Gryllus species of field crickets by using the male cricket song to locate hosts. All previous studies with this system have examined fly song preferences in populations of flies that primarily exploit a single host species of cricket. Here we tested a population of flies that naturally parasitizes multiple cricket species. We found significant interspecific host song preferences; however, as predicted, the strength of preference was reduced compared to single-host populations of flies. We also examined fly song selection for intraspecific variants of two of the cricket host species; flies showed significant preference for intraspecific song variants of one of the two cricket species. Our results demonstrate that the degree of behavioural specialization, in a very highly specialized fly, nevertheless shows interpopulation variation consistent with the numbers of host species utilized.

AB Visual displays allow animals to communicate information about social status and to minimize costs of dangerous fighting. However, in aquatic animals, visual signals may be seriously affected by increased turbidity. In juvenile salmonids, subordinates signal defeat through a darkening in coloration and in doing so reduce further attacks from dominant individuals. We examined the behaviour and physiology of socially interacting brown trout, Salmo trutta, dyads in clear water, low turbidity and high turbidity. Overall, the characteristic aggression associated with socially competing salmonids was reduced in turbid conditions and visual displays of subordinates were exaggerated. It has been suggested that darkening of subordinate salmonids is primarily a result of increased stress, and acts secondarily in communication. However, although plasma cortisol was highest in subordinates, turbidity did not affect cortisol concentrations. In conclusion, exaggeration of subordinate visual signals in turbid conditions appears to be a response to alterations in environment, rather than a secondary stress effect.

AB Supplementary feeding of wild birds during winter is one of the most popular wildlife management activities, and is likely to have profound influence on the behavioural ecology of a species. At garden bird feeders, birds are now often fed well into the breeding season. Providing food within an established songbird territory, however, is likely to influence the territorial behaviour of the resident male. We used song performance during the dawn chorus in early spring to study behavioural changes in food-supplemented great tits, Parus major. After 2 weeks of continuous food supply within their territory, supplemented males started dawn singing later than control males, and thus postponed their regular dawn chorus before sunrise. This effect was maintained 2 weeks after food supplementation had ended. However, we did not find an effect of long-term feeding on song output. Our results were largely unexpected because formal models and field studies on short-term food supplementation suggested an earlier start of dawn singing or a higher dawn song output. Because we did not observe great tits visiting the feeders before sunrise or food supplementation increasing the numbers of conspecific intruders, the reasons for the delay in the start of dawn singing remain unclear; possible explanations include the presence of predators at feeding stations and the quality of the supplementary food itself. Delaying dawn singing could potentially affect the reproductive success of supplemented males, for example if females base extrapair mating decisions on dawn song performance of their mates.

AB The nature of how behaviour at one time step influences the next is of great interest to behavioural ecologists, but rarely used for comparisons between animals. Time depth recorders (TDR) and other archival tags have been widely used to infer patterns of diving and foraging. However, while we can extract variables that describe individual dives, how runs of dives may indicate behaviours and how one dive influences the next are not fully understood. Treating TDR data as time series, we examined patterns of autocorrelation to investigate structure in the timing of behaviour. We fitted an oscillating best-fit curve to the autocorrelation and used the parameters of this curve to investigate differences in foraging strategy of 129 macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus, of both sexes. We found interannual differences in autocorrelation parameters as well as differences between reproductive stages. In contrast to other studies of macaroni penguin diving based on depth analysis, we found no differences between the sexes. We mimicked changes in the various parameters by simulation of dive profiles, and used these to infer biological meaning from the parameters. As this technique makes very few assumptions about how to identify a dive or cluster of dives, we suggest that it is a useful first characterization of diving or cyclical behaviour in a wide range of animals.

AB Subordinate domestic pigs show behavioural tactics similar to the ones described as tactical deception in primates and corvids when foraging with scrounging dominants for a single monopolizable food source. Here we investigated further whether they can learn deceptive tactics to counter a scrounger by first retrieving the smaller of two hidden food baits, and whether they can discriminate between different types of co-forager. Seven subordinate pigs were tested with co-foragers, and also alone, when foraging for two differently sized food baits hidden in two of 12 buckets in a foraging arena. Unlike their co-foragers, the subordinates already knew where the foods were located; co-foragers differed in whether they were scroungers or not. Subordinates did not respond to scrounging with the predicted deceptive tactic of visiting the small bait first. They did, however, lose their overall preference for retrieving the large bait first and increased their foraging speed compared to when foraging with nonscroungers or on their own. The findings suggest the ability to discriminate between different individual co-foragers in domestic pigs, and increasing foraging speed as a way of responding to exploitation by scrounging dominants in competitive foraging situations with several food patches. 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Aphidophagous predators adapt their foraging behaviour to the presence of conspecific and heterospecific larvae. We studied the effect of the presence of conspecific larvae and their tracks on the oviposition site selection of an aphid- specific predator, Episyrphus balteatus DeGeer ( Diptera: Syrphidae), in two-choice experiments using a leaf disc bioassay. Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify the volatile chemicals released from odour extracts of E. balteatus larval tracks. The behavioural effects of these volatile substances on hoverfly females were also evaluated. Our experiments demonstrated that E. balteatus females were deterred from ovipositing when presented with a Vicia faba leaf with aphids and conspecific larvae. The oviposition-deterring stimulus was also active when females were presented with a leaf that contained conspecific larval tracks. A mixture of chemical compounds was found in the volatile pattern of odour extracts of larval tracks. The main volatile chemicals were 3-methylbutanoic acid, 2-methylbutanoic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, hexanoic acid and phenol. Females also laid significantly fewer eggs in response to odorant volatiles emitted from larval extracts. These results highlight that predatory hoverfly females avoid ovipositing in aphid colonies in which conspecific larvae or their tracks are already present, suggesting that this behaviour constitutes a strategy that enables females to optimize their oviposition site and reduce competition suffered by their offspring.

AB The evolutionary importance of variation in female preferences has been ignored until recently, in part because evidence that variation in specific female preferences results in variation in mate choice in the wild has been lacking. In the laboratory, females of the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus prefer large males that court (courters) to small males that sneak (sneakers). However, variation in this preference is related to female size, with the strength of preference for courter males increasing with female size. In this study we found that both a female's size and her strength of preference for courter males were significantly related to whether or not she mated with a courter male. These results provide strong evidence for variation in female mate preference influencing the mating success of males in the wild. When combined with previous results demonstrating a correlation between female size distribution and frequency of the two types of males across populations, our results suggest that variation in female preference helps to promote variation in male alternative mating behaviours, and ultimately heritable variation in male traits.

AB Leaf-cutting ants are polyphagous herbivores that, despite their catholicity, show distinct preferences in the substrate choice for their symbiotic fungus. We investigated to what extent avoidance learning and long-term memory for plant unsuitability underlie foraging responses in the field. First, the acceptability of 10 rarely harvested plant species was tested on field colonies located in two different habitats, where the tested plant species were either present or not. Colonies in the habitat where the plant species occurred avoided all species on first encounter, suggesting previous experience with them. Colonies without the plant species in their habitat, however, first accepted, but then avoided four of them when tested after 24 and 48 h. Such an avoidance response towards previously acceptable leaves could be experimentally induced by infiltrating acceptable leaves with a fungicide (cycloheximide) not detectable to the ants, but harmful to the symbiotic fungus, indicating that workers learn to reject plants that have detrimental effects on the fungus, but not on themselves. To determine how robust memory for plant unsuitability was, workers from field colonies were offered the previously avoided, yet untreated plant every 2 weeks, and its acceptance monitored in the long term. It took up to 18 weeks until foragers harvested the plant again, indicating the involvement of robust long-term avoidance learning in foragers. We argue that the harvesting pattern observed in field colonies largely depends on the workers' foraging experience, essential in a highly diverse environment where both leaf availability and quality vary throughout the year.

AB Understanding the factors that influence escape responses can provide important insight into processes that permit coexistence between species. I tested whether learning shapes the expression and timing of escape behaviour of native lizards to invasive fire ants. Fence lizards survive encounters with fire ants by body twitching to remove stinging ants and fleeing the source of attack. I found that adult lizards from invaded sites body-twitched more frequently and fled sooner than did lizards from uninvaded sites, minimizing their exposure to envenomation. Juveniles' small size makes them more vulnerable to fire ants, and they fled rapidly from encounters, irrespective of their site of origin. A higher percentage of adult lizards body-twitched and fled, and they fled sooner, with repeated exposure to fire ants over 4 days, and lizards that had been repeatedly exposed to fire ants fled sooner than did control-conditioned lizards. These results suggest that adult lizards may learn to flee more rapidly after repeated encounters with fire ants. However, the percentage of lizards that performed this behaviour appeared to be driven by aspects of the testing procedure other than the presence of fire ants, as the percentage of lizards that fled or body-twitched in response to fire ants was not affected by prior fire ant conditioning. These results suggest that adult lizards cannot learn to show escape behaviour with repeated exposure to fire ants, but that they can optimize this behaviour by fleeing sooner. This study highlights the need to test alternative explanations rigorously for apparent learned behaviour. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In aquatic habitats prey often show maximum responsiveness to predators when they are exposed to kairomones and alarm cues in combination. As alarm cues can derive from heterospecific as well as conspecific animals, prey may need to. ne tune their responses depending on the taxa with which they co-occur. We used juveniles of the freshwater gastropod, Lymnaea stagnalis L. (great pond snail) to test whether the response to heterospecific alarm cues could be enhanced by cohabitation in the absence of predators, and therefore without the potential for cue association learning. Snails were raised from oviposition alongside one of four other pulmonate species, differing in their phylogenetic relatedness to L. stagnalis, that is, from intragenus to intrasuborder. The antipredator response to heterospecific alarm cues paired with fish kairomones was then compared with the response of L. stagnalis reared in isolation. Cohabitation increased the response to heterospecic alarm cues paired with fish kairomones only when L. stagnalis had developed in the presence of closely related (Lymnaea fusca and Radix balthica) rather than distantly related heterospecifics (Physella acuta and Planorbarius corneus). Hence, in L. stagnalis, learning to recognize heterospecific alarm cues can occur without the need for cue association but the learnt response is constrained by species' relatedness. This result suggests that differential responses observed in studies based on wild-caught animals in response to heterospecific alarm cues may be explained by learning through cohabitation alone.

AB Male birds often face a loss of paternity in the broods they attend because of promiscuous behaviour by their mates. Parental investment theory predicts that caring for the offspring of rival males incurs costs, selecting against males that care for unrelated offspring. We examined the relationship between male parental care and paternity in the facultatively polygynous spotless starling, Sturnus unicolor, during three consecutive breeding seasons. We found no evidence that male spotless starlings reduce their feeding rates to their nestlings in relation to their loss of paternity. Unexpectedly, cuckolded males provisioned nestlings more than noncuckolded males in relation to the presence of extrapair offspring. Although this result deserves further investigation, we argue that spotless starling males do not reduce their feeding rate when they lose paternity mostly because variance in male feeding rate is not very costly in a species in which polygamy is related to male fitness, the occurrence of extrapair offspring is unpredictable and reliable cues to assess paternity are unlikely. Several hypotheses are presented to interpret an increase in feeding rates of cuckolded males over non-cuckolded males in terms of parental quality with feeding rates either envisaged as a form of mating effort or related to kin selection and depending on begging level, sibling competition and genetic parentage within broods.

AB Males of many species perform elaborate displays in which multiple ornaments feature prominently. However, female preferences often depend upon both display movements and a subset of the ornaments. This response selectivity means that female choice cannot explain the function of nonpreferred ornaments. These structures may instead have an ancillary function (e. g. enhancing signal efficacy or modifying information content). Male junglefowl, Gallus gallus, possess multiple fleshy ornaments, which feature prominently during food-related displays (tidbitting). There is strong evidence for female choice based on display frequency and comb characteristics, but little evidence for choice based on wattles. Wattles are thin, elastic structures that hang loosely from a male's lower mandibles and vary in size over a male's lifetime. These structures swing rapidly during tidbitting, potentially increasing the area around the head and increasing image motion. Males also tidbit more vigorously with highly preferred food, increasing wattle displacement and thereby potentially affecting information content. We tested the prediction that wattles enhance signal efficacy and information content by conducting high-definition playbacks, using three-dimensional animations of tidbitting males with differing wattle properties. Results revealed that the food-searching response of receivers was robust to changes in wattle size and motion. Increased wattle displacement did not decrease orienting latency or increase food-searching duration, which suggests that wattles do not contribute significantly to information content. However, apparent wattle size significantly decreased orienting latency, demonstrating that wattles increase the conspicuousness of the tidbitting signal. These results suggest that wattles are maintained because they enhance signal efficacy. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To protect their colonies from robbing by conspecifics, honeybees have evolved nest-guarding behaviour. Guards adjust their acceptance threshold so that, as the likelihood of robbing increases, fewer non-nestmates are admitted. In addition to the possibility of robbing, queenless colonies may be infiltrated by reproductively parasitic non-nestmates. We tested the hypothesis that queenless colonies would be more discriminatory of non-nestmates than queenright colonies. As predicted, queenless colonies accepted significantly fewer non-nestmates (from queenright colonies) than they did nestmates, whereas queenright colonies did not differentiate significantly between the two sources. This trend continued once laying workers became active in queenless colonies. Thus there is evidence that queenless colonies are more discerning against potential reproductive parasites than queenright colonies. We also tested the hypothesis that as the likelihood of an intruder being a reproductive parasite increased, guards would become less permissive of allowing it entrance to the colony. Queenright colonies accepted significantly more non-nestmates from queenright colonies (no active ovaries) than they did non-nestmates from queenless colonies (many with active ovaries). However, queenless colonies did not make this distinction. We suggest that to queenless colonies all non-nestmates are potential parasites. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Begging by young provokes adults to provide food for them. However, eventually begging by young and provisioning by adults cease and young become nutritionally independent. Why do young cease begging and so forgo food brought to them by adults? Three explanations have been proposed: (1) adults may not respond to begging anymore and cease feeding begging young; (2) young may voluntarily switch from begging to independent foraging as they gain more rewards from this; (3) young may become unable to produce stimulating begging calls. We tested these three explanations using meerkat, Suricata suricatta, pups. Playback of begging calls at groups where begging had naturally ceased provoked adults to resume provisioning, suggesting that adults had not stopped responding to begging. Experimental provision of food to pups mimicking either natural pup feeding or foraging success produced no differences in subsequent changes in begging or foraging behaviour, suggesting that pups were not assessing the most rewarding means of obtaining food and switching from begging to foraging accordingly. The begging calls of pups (aged 40-60 days) were acoustically different to those produced when they were juveniles (aged 100-120 days), and adults discriminated between rate-controlled playbacks of the two age classes of calls, delivering less food to calls of a juvenile than to the same individual's calls recorded when a pup. Adult meerkats paid attention to the acoustic structure of begging calls, and ceased provisioning when the call structure changed. We suggest that older pups are unable to produce stimulating begging calls. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cultural traits spread via multiple mechanisms among individuals within social groups, including via transmission biases that occur when subordinates copy from dominants (prestige transmission), or via common cultural trait variants that are favoured over rare ones (consensus transmission). Most animal populations are subdivided into social groups where cultural learning occurs, yet theoretical studies of cultural trait transmission have tended to focus on within-group transmission dynamics. We developed an agent-based model of cultural transmission in socially structured populations in which a trait arises in one individual and either persists until a stable population equilibrium is reached, or goes extinct. With this model, we systematically varied group size, rates of dispersal among groups, mortality rates, transmission characteristics, the benefit of the cultural trait (including possibly negative benefits), and whether individuals disperse locally or randomly. We used generalized linear models to examine how changes in these parameters influence trait extinction, equilibrium prevalence and time to equilibrium. Four traits increased the probability of extinction: smaller group size, higher background mortality, lower transmission rate and more costly traits (although costly traits sometimes reached an equilibrium). Local dispersal and biased transmission mechanisms (prestige and consensus) had no significant effects on extinction probability, and similar patterns were found for equilibrium prevalence. We found that a lower dispersal rate and local dispersal slowed the time required for a trait to reach equilibrium, as did smaller groups, lower transmission rates and lower costs. Collectively, these analyses reveal that prestige and consensus transmission have weaker effects than other factors associated with demographic and social conditions.

AB Many animals display multiple signals that can be used by conspecifics to gather information about the condition or quality of potential mates or competitors. Different signals can indicate different aspects of individual quality or function in spatially or temporally separated periods. However, for long-distance migratory birds, it is unclear if signals, such as plumage traits, function in different phases of the annual cycle. We investigated the potential role of carotenoid-based tail and flank plumage, and bib size, in relation to extrapair paternity and polygyny in the American redstart, Setophaga ruticilla. This work complements our previous research suggesting tail feather brightness acts as a status signal, mediating territory acquisition during the nonbreeding season in Jamaica. Here, we show that tail feather brightness also serves as an important signal during the breeding season. Specifically, our results indicate that polygyny, a behaviour highly dependent on obtaining and defending multiple territories, is significantly predicted by tail brightness. Interestingly, flank redness best predicted whether individuals secured paternity at their nest and the proportion of within-pair offspring sired. We suggest that by expanding the study of plumage function in long-distance migrants to events occurring throughout the annual cycle, we gain a critical perspective on the function and evolution of ornamental traits. 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Sperm competition theory predicts that colonially breeding birds, such as many seabirds, should be exposed to high risks of sperm competition because there are many potential mating partners and severe socioecological constraints on mate-guarding behaviour. However, parentage studies have usually revealed a low frequency of extrapair paternity in colonial seabirds. Detailed studies of copulation behaviour could provide valuable insights into the causality of genetic monogamy in these species. We investigated the timing, frequency and success of extrapair and within-pair copulation attempts in the little auk, a socially monogamous and highly colonial seabird that raises only a single chick per year. We found that the majority of monitored individuals (above 60% in both sexes) engaged in extrapair copulation activities. Extrapair copulation attempts made up usually more than 10% of all copulation attempts of a particular individual but were generally unsuccessful because of female rejection behaviour. Only 2% (8/330) of all copulations with cloacal contact were extrapair copulations. Molecular parentage analysis of 64 chicks revealed only two cases of extrapair paternity, which is comparable to the proportion of successful copulations that were extrapair. We conclude that genetic monogamy seems to be maintained at a proximate level through female resistance to male extrapair copulation attempts and frequent within-pair copulations. Nevertheless, not all extrapair copulations were rejected by females, which suggests that engaging in one or a few extrapair copulations could be adaptive to females, for example as an insurance against mate infertility.

AB A social hierarchy is generally assumed to exist in those mammalian societies in which the costs and benefits of group living are distributed unevenly among group members. We analysed infrared closed-circuit television footage, collected over 3 years in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, to test whether social groups of European badgers have dominance hierarchies. Analysis of directed aggression between dyads revealed linear dominance hierarchies in three social-group-years, but patterns within social groups were not consistent across years. Dominance hierarchies were significantly steeper than random in five out of six social-group-years. In those social-group-years where a linear hierarchy was determined, there was an effect of sex on dominance rank, with females gaining significantly higher rank than males in two social-group-years. Overall, rank was not related to age, nor did it appear to affect the likelihood of an individual being wounded, or an individual's breeding status. The latter resulted from nonorthogonality between sex and breeding status, as there were only two breeding males. Overall, hierarchies were primarily dominated by breeding females, and may occur when breeding competition arises. Relatedness, unreciprocated allogrooming and sequential allomarking were not consistently related to levels of directed aggression across social-group-years. We suggest that dominance structures within European badger groups may be context dependent, with future study required to complete our understanding of where, and when, they arise.

AB Although plasticity in signal production is well recognized as a means for animals to modify their communication systems, modifying responsiveness to signals could be equally important. We examined plasticity of responsiveness to social signals that mediate group formation and cohesion in red crossbills. The red crossbill is composed of several ecologically diverged forms, defined by variation in morphology, ecological specialization and vocal behaviour; each form is associated with a distinct variant of the species 'contact call.' To understand how plasticity in response to signal variants may influence social dynamics, we examined the response of red crossbills to distinct call variants before and after experimental pairing with a companion of a different form. In a playback study conducted soon after birds were captured we found that adult crossbills responded more to calls that were similar to their own calls. However, social experience with a companion that produced a different contact call variant eroded this response selectivity; at the end of the study birds experimentally housed with a companion that produced a different call variant responded equally to all species-typical calls, but control birds continued to respond selectively to calls that were similar to their own. The observed form of response plasticity may permit birds to gain information from a wider range of conspecifics but is unlikely to facilitate the social intermixing of crossbills of different forms; birds that respond to all crossbill call variants probably would not gain acceptance into flocks of other forms.

AB We investigated the use of the skylight intensity gradient as a new celestial compass cue in sandhoppers ( Talitrus saltator). Experiments were conducted at different latitudes ( temperate and equatorial) with different zenithal distances of the sun under a translucent ( opaline) Plexiglas dome. We also used a blue filter placed on the translucent dome to remove the spectral sky gradient, and a screen for the sun to remove the skylight intensity gradient. Therefore, in our experimental conditions, the spectral gradient and skylight polarization were impossible to use as directional information. Sandhoppers used the difference in skylight intensity in their directional choice when zenithal distance was greater than 10 degrees. Therefore, the anisotropic radiance distribution ( i.e. the difference in skylight intensity between the hemidome containing the sun and the opposite one) is a real celestial factor in animal spatial orientation. However, it is probably more imprecise than the solar orientation and could not be used by all animals. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Posthatching maternal care such as food provisioning and protection has evolved several times in insects, allowing offspring (larvae, nymphs) to interact with their mothers and potentially influence their investment. The evolutionary conflict over the duration and amount of parental care is thought to promote the evolution of offspring begging behaviours either as honest signals of need or as competitive signals with the potential to manipulate parents into investing more. In most social insects, parental care is not obligatory and may represent a less derived state than in vertebrate systems making them more appropriate to test ancestral conditions for the evolution of begging signals. Here, we review forms of maternal care in insects ranging from protection to food provisioning and evidence of offspring begging behaviours influencing maternal care, including condition-dependent chemical cues produced by offspring that may turn out to be solicitation pheromones. Since behavioural parent-offspring interactions are embedded in the reproductive and developmental physiology of mother and offspring, we stress the need for behavioural studies to be complemented by physiological measurements which will allow us to understand better the nature of conflict resolution. We propose a hypothetical mechanism of maternal care regulation by direct internal chemical signals (i.e. hormones) and indirect external chemical signals (i.e. solicitation pheromones) influencing maternal reproductive physiology and future reproduction. Social insect species and the integrated study of behavioural interactions and physiological/reproductive consequences may represent promising new experimental systems for direct tests of the evolution of begging signals, complementing current research on parent-offspring conflict.

AB Chemical cues are commonly used by prey to assess predation risk. Prey typically respond to predator cues by altering behaviour, but their response may depend on predator diet. There are few data on how predators feeding on prey types spanning a continuous gradient of relatedness affect prey behaviour. Here I present the results of a study evaluating the relationship between predator diet and prey behaviour. We presented two species of freshwater gastropods with caged crayfish fed one of five diets and compared them with a no-predator control. Diets included conspecific prey, congeners, prey in the same order, and two prey taxa in different phyla. We monitored behaviour and growth over 3 weeks. Predators feeding on conspecifics induced a large increase in the refuge use of both prey species. Refuge use was highly contingent on predator diet, as one snail species responded only to predators feeding on conspecifics and the other species responded only to predators feeding on conspecifics and congeners. Neither snail species responded to predators feeding on prey taxa in a different genus. Snail behaviour did not depend on the degree of ecological overlap with diet items, but behaviour was related to the degree of phylogenetic similarity. There was no evidence that diets of an intermediate relatedness induced an intermediate response. Instead, prey responded to the diet gradient in a threshold manner. Growth responses were generally concordant with behavioural responses. The overall effect of predators on prey in nature depends on how variation in predator diet translates into altered prey phenotypes. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Rats, Rattus norvegicus, produce 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations in aversive situations such as during exposure to cats or fear conditioning. These calls are considered to be part of the animal's defensive repertoire and might serve as alarm signals for conspecifics. The aim of the present study was to test whether the production of 22 kHz calls is affected by the social context during fear conditioning. Animals were tested in one of three experimental conditions: either alone, with an anaesthetized conspecific, or with an active conspecific. In line with the hypothesized alarming function of 22 kHz calls, we expected the presence of a conspecific to potentiate the production of 22 kHz calls. The results, however, show that the production of 22 kHz calls during fear conditioning is clearly not potentiated by the presence of a conspecific; if at all, its presence had a mild attenuating effect on call rate. Also, call characteristics were similar in all three experimental conditions. Therefore, our findings do not support the hypothesis that the sender actively produces 22 kHz calls to warn conspecifics about danger. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ability to learn about chemosensory stimuli in the prenatal period is now well established in a wide variety of vertebrate species. This may help to shape development and behaviour. Evidence for early visual learning has already been shown in newly hatched cuttlefish. We exposed cuttlefish embryos to crabs for at least a week before hatching. This crab exposure induced a subsequent visual preference for crabs in 7-day-old juveniles. The results show for the first time embryonic visual learning in animals. Such cognitive abilities in embryos that can perceive visual stimulation could confer important adaptive advantages in processing and acquiring information about foods likely to be available after hatching.

AB Hamilton's theory of the selfish herd suggests that gregarious behaviour is a strategy by which individuals seek cover behind other group members to reduce the risk of predation. Therefore, it can be predicted that individuals will have less reason to seek cover within a group if the habitat itself provides physical structure, and therefore cover. We tested this prediction with European minnows, Phoxinus phoxinus, in a large, seminatural stream channel using a fully factorial design in which habitat complexity and predation risk were manipulated independently. We recorded shoal size, rates of movement and association preferences for familiar fish. Consistent with predictions, European minnows responded to the presence of predatory pike, Esox lucius, by forming larger shoals, but this effect was observed only in structurally simple habitats. Fish also responded to increased predation risk by reducing their rates of movement, and this was particularly pronounced in complex habitats. Association preferences for familiar fish were unaffected by predation risk in simple habitats. Together, these results suggest that when at risk from predation, European minnows shoal to obtain shelter, but only when there is insufficient physical structure available. Moreover, the results show the extent to which physical habitat complexity can affect the expression of gregarious behaviour. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ability to differentiate and localize conspecific calls from the ambient soundscape is particularly challenging for aquatic animals because of the increased wavelength, and concomitant increased distortion, of sound underwater. The increased wavelength is especially problematic for fish because of the relatively small space between their two ears, making interaural comparisons difficult. We presented round goby with conspecific calls, two heterospecific calls (Padogobius bonelli and Gobius niger), white noise and a 100 Hz tone burst to ascertain the effects of sound structure on localization abilities. The round goby has no obvious hearing specializations, causing theory to predict that it should not be able to localize sounds. In the laboratory, fish were presented with a silent speaker and a speaker playing one sound of interest and their behavioural response was quantified. In all trials except those using Gobius niger calls, fish preferentially selected the playing speaker over the silent but the intensity of this response differed with sound type. When the round goby call was played, fish came closer to the speaker and swam faster when responding. Also, the ability to directionalize the sound, measured by examining the path taken to the speaker, was significantly better when the conspecific call was played than when other sounds were presented. While it is still unclear how the round goby is able to directionalize the conspecific call, it appears clear they can directionalize, and possibly localize, conspecific calls as well as differentiate between call types.

AB There are numerous reports of novel learned behaviour patterns in animal populations, yet the factors influencing the invention and spread of these innovations remain poorly understood. Here we investigated to what extent the pattern of spread of innovations in captive groups of starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, could be predicted by knowledge of individual and social group variables, including association patterns, social rank orders, measures of neophobia and asocial learning performance. We presented small groups of starlings with a series of novel extractive foraging tasks and recorded the latency for each bird to contact and solve each task, as well as the orders of contacting and solving. We then explored which variables best predicted the observed diffusion patterns. Object neophobia and social rank measures characterized who was the first of the group to contact the novel foraging tasks, and the subsequent spread of contacting tasks was associated with latency to feed in a novel environment. Asocial learning performance, measured in isolation, predicted who was the first solver of the novel foraging tasks in each group. Association patterns did not predict the spread of solving. Contact latency and solving duration were negatively correlated, consistent with social learning underlying the spread of solving. Our findings indicate that we can improve our understanding of the diffusion dynamics of innovations in animal groups by investigating group-dependent and individual variables in combination. We introduce novel methods for exploring predictors of the origin and spread of behavioural innovations that could be widely applied. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In cooperatively breeding systems, breeders may reduce their provisioning to the brood when aided by helpers. However, this is found in only some species, and the reasons for the different reactions of breeders are far from clear. Recently, a paradoxical case of breeders in the azure-winged magpie, Cyanopica cyanus, increasing their contribution when aided by helpers has further complicated the issue. Existing models on the response of breeders consider only whether helpers contribute to increase the amount of food delivered to the brood. Helpers, however, can also contribute with other types of help that may increase the value of the whole brood for parents, such as reducing predation rate. Here we present a deterministic decision-making model to predict how parents should reduce or increase their parental effort on the basis of the relative role of both types of helpers' contributions: delivering food and/or dispensing protection against predation. The model can be used by field workers to make qualitative and quantitative predictions with their data. As an example, we show how data for the azure-winged magpie predicts the observed increase of parental contribution in the presence of helpers.

AB We used a computer game to examine three aspects of patch-leaving decisions in humans: how well do humans perform compared to the optimal policy, can they adjust their behaviour adaptively in response to different distributions of prey across patches and on what cues are their decisions based? Subjects earned money by catching fish when they briefly appeared within a pond; the timing of appearances was stochastic but at a rate proportional to how many fish remained. Caught fish were not replaced and ponds varied in how many fish they initially contained ( according to three different distributions). At any point subjects could move to a new pond, but travel took some time. They delayed this switch much too long. Furthermore, regardless of the distribution of prey, subjects spent longer at ponds where they had found more items ( contrary to optimality predictions in two of the environments). However, they apparently responded not to the number of captures directly ( despite this appearing on screen) but to the current interval without a capture, to the interval preceding the last capture, and to the time spent at the current pond. Self-reports supported this order of cue importance. Subjects often left directly after a capture, perhaps an example of the Concorde fallacy. High success rate in the preceding patch decreased residence time and subjects appeared to be learning to leave earlier over the latter two thirds of the experiment. Minimization of delay to the next capture alone might explain some of the suboptimal behaviour observed. 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Research on cooperative breeding has begun to focus on direct fitness benefits gained by helpers, particularly when individuals are unrelated to those they assist. There has been considerable interest in helping possibly operating as a signal, either to show off individual quality to potential mates ('social prestige') or to ensure group membership ('pay to stay'). However, empirical investigation of these phenomena remains sparse. Here we investigate the potential for signalling via provisioning behaviour in the bell miner, Manorina melanophrys, an obligate cooperative breeding species in which the predominantly male helpers are commonly unrelated to breeders. Aggression between birds was extremely rare, and there was little to indicate a pay to stay system. The presence versus absence of members of the breeding pair as a potential audience at the nest had little influence on helper behaviour ( e. g. load size/composition, visit duration or frequency). Helpers did produce more individually distinctive vocalizations when in the presence of another helper or the breeding male, although presence of the breeding female ( a likely target of male signals) surprisingly had no effect. There was also evidence that nest arrival times coincided somewhat. These results are probably best explained by the helpers and breeding males being involved in additional cooperative behaviours when away from the nest, such as mobbing. Overall, there does not appear to be any evidence that bell miner helpers use nestling provisioning to signal their quality and/or work rate to one another or to either member of the breeding pair.

AB Species recognition may be learned through imprinting early in life. Imprinting has normally been studied under highly unnatural conditions in the laboratory. We tested whether species recognition mediated through imprinting is individually modi. able in a field setting where great tits, Parus major, have been artificially cross-fostered to blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, and vice versa. We have shown previously that cross-fostered birds have deviant species recognition, in terms of both mate choice and aggressive responses towards rivals. Natural interactions among conspecifics and heterospecifics are common in these populations, potentially giving cross-fostered birds scope for relearning their species identity. We tested whether species recognition may change with experience during adulthood by comparing the aggressive response of cross-fostered birds and controls of different ages towards caged intruders. When breeding, cross-fostered birds responded aggressively towards same-sex individuals of their heterospecific foster species, while unmanipulated controls responded mainly towards conspecifics. We found that the aggressive response decreased with age at similar rates in both treatments and in both species. Moreover, there was no effect of age on the relative response towards conspecifics and heterospecifics in either treatment. Hence, we found no evidence that the species recognition behaviour towards same-sex individuals is shifted towards conspecifics with age in interspecifically cross-fostered birds. We conclude that species recognition is irreversible once it has been established in free-living great tits and blue tits. This is the first study to investigate the stability of species recognition in the field. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In fish, predation risk is often size-specific due to gape limited piscivores and visibility constraints. We have investigated whether risk-taking behaviour in perch varies in accordance with size-specific predation risk in their natural habitat. In our two study lakes, the risk of cannibalism was estimated from fishing survey data. In Lake Fisksjon, the relative risk for juvenile perch was much higher than in Lake Angersjon in the early stages, but after reaching a body length of approximately 70 mm the situation was reversed, with higher predation risk in Angersjon than in Fisksjon. Groups of perch, from either of the two lakes and of two age classes (0+ or 1+ years); were given the choice of foraging in an open area or hiding in the vegetation in the presence of a predator. Three measures of boldness were estimated: proportion of time spent in the open area, latency to start feeding and duration of first feeding bout. A principal component analysis was used to calculate individual boldness scores from a combination of the behaviour estimates. Differences in boldness scores within age classes corresponded well with the relative attack rates in the two lakes. In the youngest age class, perch from Fisksjon were less bold than those from Angersjon. In the older age class, the Fisksjon perch were bolder than those from Angersjon. Within lakes, boldness differed between age classes. Seemingly, perch adjust risk-taking behaviour to perceived predation risk. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID FOOD; EVOLUTION
AB Social learning and cognitive sophistication are often assumed to be prerequisites for the origins of culture. In contrast, we studied to what extent the most simple social influences on individual learning can support cultural inheritance. We did this using a spatial individual-based model where group foragers have to learn what to eat in a diverse patchy environment, and used simple population dynamics to investigate the potential of 'merely living in groups' to allow for inheritance of diet traditions. Our results show that grouping by itself is a sufficient social influence on individual learning for supporting the inheritance of diet traditions. Unexpectedly, we find that grouping is also sufficient to generate cumulative group-level learning through which groups increase diet quality over the generations. Whether 'traditions' or 'progressive change' dominates depends on foraging selectivity. We show that these cultural phenomena can arise as side-effects of grouping and therefore independently of their adaptive consequences. This suggests that cultural phenomena could be quite general and shows that cumulative cultural processes already occur even for the most simple social influences on learning.

AB Data collected from wild and captive bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, over the past five decades indicate that they produce individually distinctive signature whistles that function in individual recognition and in maintaining group cohesion. However, a recent study by McCowan & Reiss (2001, Animal Behaviour, 62, 1151 - 1162) failed to detect signature whistles in nine of 12 captive bottlenose dolphins. These authors suggested that previous studies of signature whistles had used biased data sets, and claimed that the visual classification methods used by most researchers were inferior to their computerized technique. To evaluate their claims, we randomly selected 20 whistles from each of 20 bottlenose dolphins from recordings made during brief capture - release events in Sarasota Bay, FL, U.S.A., and asked 10 judges to visually group spectrograms based on similarity of their contours. Judges consistently grouped whistles according to the identity of the vocalizer; the mean number of whistles of a single dolphin in the judges' groups was 18.9 +/- 1.6 out of 20 possible; resampling simulations indicate that it is highly unlikely (P < 0.0001) for this many whistles to be grouped together randomly. In contrast, the McCowan method was highly inaccurate at classifying whistles according to the identity of the vocalizer; whistles produced by multiple dolphins were grouped together. This study provides strong external validation for the reliability of visual classification of whistles, and confirms the presence of individually distinctive signature whistles in the vocal repertoire of bottlenose dolphins.

AB Changes between the inactive (resting/ruminating) and active (grazing, walking) states in groups of Merino sheep were studied in the field for different group sizes (two, four, six or eight) of either male or female animals over 6-h periods. The amount of synchrony within groups was high (60-80%) and is attributed to the mutual adjustment of behaviour by group members. To quantify this process, changes in the number of active individuals were fitted by a time homogeneous continuous time Markov chain model. We found that the probability of an individual becoming active increased with the number of active conspecifics in the group and decreased with the number of inactive conspecifics. The reverse effect was found for the probability of becoming inactive. A model of this individual decision-making process is fitted to the data and predictions of the model are shown to account for the synchrony observed within the group. Group synchronization is thus presented as a self-organized dynamic system, where collective oscillations between activity and inactivity arise stochastically from the coupling between individual Markov processes.

AB Many potential prey species possess features that falsely convey a risk to the predator. One form of visual signal hypothesized to have this function are the circular features commonly found on the wings of diurnal lepidopterans: 'eyespots'. Eyespots have been found to reduce predation by intimidating predators before an attack or startling them once an attack has been initiated, and have been proposed to work because predators falsely classify the markings as the eyes of the predators' own enemies. However, this argument lacks unambiguous experimental support because the data are consistent with the hypothesis that eyespots are effective merely because they are highly conspicuous. High contrast concentric circles are liable to be highly effective in stimulating the centre-surround arrangement of receptive fields typical of the vertebrate retina. Here, we use a field technique involving artificial moth-like stimuli, with or without different forms of grey-scale eyespots, to test these two opposing hypotheses. Across five experiments, the consistent effect is that predation risk is reduced by patterns that have high internal pattern contrast and also contrast highly with the target background, irrespective of the specific pattern arrangement. Circles are more effective than less eye-like shapes, but this constitutes only limited support for the eye-mimicry hypothesis because such patterns will also be highly conspicuous to animals with circular receptive fields in their retinae. We conclude that, contrary to popular belief, 'eyespots' can be effective predator deterrents without mimicking eyes. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB During the egg-laying period, female passerines have high resource demands and are often fed by their mates. In black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, these courtship feedings can be solicited via unique calls given by females. A female's solicitation call rate may reflect her hunger level and honestly signal need to her mate. To test this, nine chickadee pairs were supplementally fed during the egg-laying period. Solicitation call rates by these experimental females decreased significantly from prefeeding rates; the same was not true for nine control pairs. As this suggested that solicitation call rate may be directly influenced by hunger, we questioned whether variation in call rates of females may reflect differences in resource availability between habitats and/or differences in provisioning levels by their mates. We measured the solicitation calls of female chickadees mated either to socially dominant or subordinate males during egg laying in 2003 and 2004 across two sites that differ in quality for chickadees: a mature forest ( higher quality) versus a young forest ( lower quality). There was a significant interaction between rank and habitat on female solicitation call rates: subordinate females in young forests had significantly higher calling rates compared to dominants. There was no difference in call rates of subordinates and dominants in mature forest, and these call rates did not differ from those of dominants in young forest. This result suggests that food limitation imposed by habitat may disproportionately affect subordinate pairs.

AB Alternative male mating tactics in species with external fertilization are often viewed as coercive matings by low-quality males, when a male, unable to attract a female himself, steals fertilizations from a spawning pair by adopting 'sneaky' mating tactics, thereby eroding the interests of both the pair-mating male and female. Although a cost of sneaking to guarder males is inevitable, we highlight emerging evidence that females may actually seek and benefit from mating with sneaking males. Sneaking may thus be a means by which females gain access to resources critical for reproduction when these are defended by males adopting a guarder tactic, while maintaining some control over indirect ( genetic) benefits through mate choice. We consider a range of potential costs and benefits that females may obtain from matings that involve sneakers and review empirical studies on female responses to sneaking. We show that the outcome of the trade-off between costs and benefits is context specific and may vary among mating systems, species, populations within species, and individual females within populations. This emerging evidence undermines the view that sneaking necessarily represents forced fertilizations and that sneakers are always low-quality males making 'the best of a bad job'. When females prefer to spawn in the presence of sneaker males, the distinction between deliberate polyandry and sneaking becomes ambiguous and females may only be limited in the expression of their mating preferences by resource monopolization or mate guarding by dominant males, resulting in an intersexual conflict.

AB Current theory on trait-mediated interactions in tri-trophic food chains shows that antipredator behaviour of the middle species can cause similar indirect effects giving rise to trophic cascades as mediated by density changes. In this article, the effect of predation risk in a tri-trophic food chain ( bean plant-two-spotted spider mite prey-predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis) is measured, both on plants ( changes in leaf damage) and spider mites ( changes in egg numbers, mortality rate and dispersal behaviour), under two risk scenarios. In the predator risk treatment a predatory mite was caged in an experimental cell that was placed above a leaf disc with spider mites. This prevented the predator from subduing prey while the predator was perceived by spider mites as a potential threat. In the predator cues treatment a predatory mite was introduced to the leaf disc for 24 h before placing the spider mites on the disc. Compared to control without predators, after four days we observed in both risk treatments a nonsignificant increase in plant damage per spider mite and a significant decline in spider mite fecundity. No significant effect of predation risk on spider mite mortality was observed. We also showed that the above effects are not uniformly distributed in time. For example, the spider mite fecundity and dispersal rate in the predator cues treatment were significantly different from the control only the first day. We also found that under predator cues treatment, walking activity of the spider mites increased significantly.

AB Many studies have shown that colour signals are important in spider-insect interactions. The bright body coloration of certain orb-weaving spiders seems to serve as a visual lure to diurnal prey. However, no studies have examined whether this coloration affects spiders' nocturnal hunting. Some nocturnal lepidopteran pollinators use colour vision to locate their food resources, so orb-weaving spiders' bright coloration may also be attractive to visually oriented nocturnal insects. To assess the role of body coloration of the orchid spider, Leucauge magnifica, in luring nocturnal prey, we investigated whether: ( 1) these spiders actively hunt during the night; ( 2) nocturnal prey comprise a significant proportion of total prey intake; and ( 3) altering body colour signals significantly affect the nocturnal prey capture rate. Round-the- clock monitoring of L. magnifica activity patterns showed that they hunt more actively at night. Owing to the presence of relatively large moths in their diet at night, L. magnifica consumed higher prey biomass during nocturnal hunting, although this was not statistically significant owing to large variability. Painting over the spiders' yellow ventrum stripes significantly reduced their moth capture rate. These results show that certain orb-weaving spiders with bright body coloration attract nocturnal prey, and they obtain larger prey from nocturnal hunting.

AB We showed how super- organisms, here ant colonies, modify their home according to their increasing or decreasing space requirements. The ontogeny of wall building by colonies of the ant Temnothorax albipennis involves discontinuous rebuilding events that are reminiscent of moulting in insects. Here for the first time we manipulated worker density by changing nest cavity size instead of worker number, thus avoiding accidentally shifting the balance of workers with different propensities for building tasks. Our results suggest for the first time that history influences wall building in ants when worker density decreases ( e. g. with colony diminution) as well as when it increases ( e. g. with colony growth) as shown by earlier work. Furthermore, we found that ants used a greater number of the larger building blocks ( big sand grains) both after cavity expansion and, more surprisingly, also after cavity contraction. The pattern of nest `moulting' we experimentally manipulated and analysed should provide insights into possible trade- offs between the various functions and structural properties of the nest that these animals may have to optimize.

AB We examined how social context and experience affected development of antipredator behaviour and subsequent postrelease survival in the black-tailed prairie dog. Captive-reared juveniles were initially exposed to four stimulus animals: a ferret, a rattlesnake, a hawk and a cottontail control (pretraining tests). Subjects were then trained with or without an adult female demonstrator. Training involved exposure to each stimulus animal two to three times over 5 weeks. After training, each juvenile was retested with each stimulus animal (post-training tests). During pretraining tests, juveniles responded differentially to the stimulus animals. They were least active with the snake, fled the most in tests with the hawk, and were less vigilant with the ferret than with the snake. Following training, juveniles trained with experienced adults were more wary with all three predators than juveniles trained without an experienced adult present. We then compared the antipredator behaviour of captive-reared juveniles trained with experienced adult females with that of wild-reared juveniles of the same age. For all behavioural measures except shelter use, wild-experienced animals differentiated more strongly among predator types than did captive-trained juveniles. One year after reintroduction, survivorship of juveniles trained with experienced adults was higher than that of juveniles trained without experienced adults, but did not differ from that of wild-reared juveniles. These findings provide the first evidence that social transmission of antipredator behaviour during training can enhance long-term survival following release and that as long as a social training regime is used, predator avoidance training can emulate experience acquired in the wild.

AB In the most common models of communication, it is assumed that animals provide reliable information about phenotype, and hence can settle competitive contests without physical interactions like fights. This assumption has rarely been tested for wild mammals. Recent studies of mammals have revealed relationships of vocal attributes to age and body size. Here, we analyse relationships of frequency attributes of agonistic vocalizations to phenotype (age, body size, proboscis size and agonistic behaviour) in males of the southern elephant seal, Mirminga leonina, a species with intense male competition for access to females, and in which vocalizations are used frequently to settle male-male contests. We analysed formant structure and vocal tract size, and found that nasal and oral components of the vocal tract contribute separately to vocal formants; hence, the male's proboscis serves to elongate the vocal tract. We also found that formants in the upper part of the frequency spectrum (fourth and fifth in particular) and formant dispersion convey significant information about age, size and resource holding potential at large, and, therefore, can be honest signals of a vocalizer's phenotype. Explained variance was statistically significant in our study and in similar studies but was not high, so formant structure cannot serve as the sole basis of acoustic assessment. Other possible sources of information exchanged in elephant seal contests are nonvocal acoustic signals (e.g. vibrations) and optical displays.

AB Despite considerable interest in the effects of natal experience on habitat selection, little attention has been paid to the adaptive significance of this behaviour. Here we suggest that experience in the natal habitat may provide dispersers with information that improves the decisions they make while searching for a new habitat. In animals with time-limited sequential search, or in laboratory experiments using one-choice protocols, experience in the natal habitat may affect an individual's estimate of its total search time, or of its chances of encountering a high-quality habitat after leaving its natal habitat. In turn, theory suggests that changes in estimates of search time or encounter rates with high-quality habitats will affect the chances that dispersers will be attracted to cues from any habitat that is perceived to be of low or medium quality. For any disperser, regardless of search tactics, salient experiences in the natal habitat may change disperser estimates of the quality of new habitats that are similar to their natal habitat. For example, a history of successful foraging in the natal habitat might increase the attractiveness of cues from natal-type habitats, whereas difficulty foraging prior to dispersal might decrease it. In turn, any process that links an individual's experience in its natal habitat with its level of preference for cues from comparable natal-type habitats would encourage a positive relationship between habitat performance and preference, without requiring genetic correlations between these two variables. Generally speaking, positive effects of natal experience on habitat preference (NHPI) are predicted to be more common than negative effects of experience on habitat preference (negative NHPI). Predictions about the effects of natal experience on disperser estimates of search time, encounter rates and habitat quality can be investigated using appropriate experimental protocols, especially those that include naive subjects raised in habitats that lack the cues that dispersers use to locate and identify habitats under natural conditions.

AB The social organization of many vertebrates is based on dominance behaviours occurring between pairs of individuals. Initial encounters between any two individuals can be crucial in determining the dominance relationship that will prevail between them throughout their lifetime. Achieving a high dominance status can be critical when competition for limited resources such as foraging sites is intense. The mechanisms that prevail for the establishment and stability of dominance relationships between individuals are, however, poorly understood. Our study aims to identify factors influencing the establishment of dominance relationships between young individuals, using white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, fawns as a model species, and to evaluate the possibility of long-term individual recognition after temporal separation. We used an experimental approach to test the alternative hypotheses that dominance relationships after temporal separation are explained by (1) the outcome of the previous encounters between opponents or (2) the body mass difference between individuals independently of the outcome of initial encounters. Social rank was established during the first encounters between individuals based on differences in body mass and was maintained afterwards even when the differences in mass between individuals were reversed. Our results suggest that individual long-term recognition may influence the outcome and the stability of dominance relationships after temporal separation of individuals. Dyadic dominance relationships seem to be established early in life and may then endure into adulthood. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The occurrence and significance of variation in apparent mate choice within populations are poorly understood. While one possible explanation for variation is that individuals differ in their mate preferences, an alternative possibility is that individuals vary in their mate selectivity or 'choosiness': that is, some individuals may be willing to accept less attractive mating partners than are others. This latter possibility is likely to result from bidirectional mate choice and differential mating access of high- versus low-quality mating partners. Here we altered the physical condition of female zebra finches, Taeniopygia gultata casta-notis, through modest trimming of their flight feathers to explore the possibility that individuals adjust selectivity in response to their own condition. We compared the selectivity of individuals with clipped versus intact wing feathers. Female finches spent less time associating with attractive males when their wings were clipped than when wings were intact. To ascertain whether their choices were influenced by the behaviour of stimulus males that perceived their altered status, we performed a companion experiment that measured male mate choice of females with clipped versus intact wings; no discrimination against clipped females was found. Collectively, these results indicate that a female's mate selectivity is dynamically adjusted based on her assessment of her own condition or mate-getting ability. Future studies that investigate the relationship between realized and ideal mate preferences are necessary to better understand preference functions and the genetic basis of mate preferences.

AB Food stored by animals can either be recovered by the hoarder or pilfered, but it is very difficult to distinguish between these possibilities under natural conditions. We tested the hypothesis that yellow pine chipmunks, Tamias amoenus, have a recovery advantage (i.e. a greater probability of finding a cached item than does a naive forager). We allowed chipmunks to cache radiolabelled pine seeds and then established artificial caches nearby. Paired artificial and real caches were identical in number of seeds, depth and microsite. Caches (393 pairs at 10 sites) were monitored during autumn 1997, 1999 and 2002. Removal of real caches represented the activity of the hoarder, foraging using spatial memory, plus the activities of pilferers, whereas the removal of artificial caches represented the activities of pilferers. We used these two measures in a competing risks model, which estimated that seed-caching chipmunks retrieved 74% of the food they stored in 1997 and 56% of the food they stored in 1999-2002. Seed-hoarding chipmunks were removed at four of the 10 sites immediately after they prepared caches. Where the seed-hoarders remained, animals took real caches 3.4 to 6.5 times faster than artificial caches, an effect that we attribute to the activity of the hoarder. Where the caching chipmunk was removed, there were no significant differences in the rates of removal of real versus artificial caches. We suggest that artificial caches can be used to estimate the proportion of caches retrieved by a seed-hoarding animal versus the proportion discovered by pilferers.

AB Investment strategies in cooperative societies are often complex but should reflect individual variation in the costs and benefits of providing care. We examined the contributions to incubation and nestling provisioning by individual members of 16 groups of the cooperatively breeding apostlebird, Struthidea cinerea. Contributions varied in relation to the age, sex and breeding status of the carer, and with group size. Yearlings were less likely to help than older birds, and, when they did, spent less time incubating and fed the brood less often. Among adults (>= 2 years old), male helpers incubated less than breeders or female helpers. Mothers spent more time incubating than female helpers, and both incubated less when in larger groups. Mean incubation effort did not differ between fathers and male helpers, or between the sexes. Neither paternal nor male helper incubation effort was related to group size. There was no difference between adult categories in the likelihood of brood provisioning. However, male helpers provisioned at a higher rate than both female helpers and breeders. Overall, individual provisioning rates were lower in larger groups, although feeding rate per nestling increased, indicating partial adjustment to the increase in available help. Mothers and female helpers, and to some extent fathers, provisioned less when in larger groups. Because indirect benefits accruing to the sexes are expected to be similar, these observations suggest that brood provisioning may confer greater direct benefits to males than females.

AB Small mammals are subject to predation from mammalian, avian and reptilian predators. There is an obvious advantage for prey species to detect the presence of predators in their environment, enabling them to make decisions about movement and foraging behaviour based on perceived risk of predation. We examined the effect of faecal odours from marsupial and eutherian predators, and a native reptilian predator, on the behaviour of three endemic Australian rodent species (the fawn-footed melomys, Melomys cervinipes, the bush rat, Rattus fuscipes, and the giant white-tailed rat, Uromys caudimaculatus) in rainforest remnants on the Atherton Tableland, North Queensland, Australia. Infrared camera traps were used to assess visit rates of rodents to odour stations containing faecal and control odours. Rodents avoided odour stations containing predator faeces, but did not avoid herbivore or control odours. The responses of the three prey species differed: in the late wet season U. caudimaculatus avoided predator odours, whereas R. fuscipes and M. cervinipes did not. In contrast, in the late dry season all three species avoided odour stations containing predator odours. We speculate that these different responses may result from variation in life history traits between the species. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Within species, natural and sexual selection work together to shape the design of animal communicative systems, and sometimes act differentially on alternate components to produce a single elaborate phenotype that works well in several contexts. Here, we show a similar pattern at the interspecific level, and describe how an intricate selective regime can shape diversification of a complex behaviour across species. Using four phylogenetic comparative methods, alternative phylogenetic hypotheses, and a data set compiled from over 50 different sources representing 53 taxa, we test the relative importance of different ecological variables on the evolution of anole visual displays. Our study makes use of the inherent complexity of these signals and the availability of published descriptions in the form of display-action-patterns. Results indicate that different selective forces are linked to change in different display components. Whereas evolutionary changes in display duration appear to be linked to sexual size dimorphism, measures of display complexity (number and uniformity of display components) were more tightly associated with the need to facilitate species recognition and the type of light environment in which the display is typically performed. We also found some evidence that ecomorph distinctions, a major force in morphological evolution of anoles, have had an impact on the evolution of display structure. We use our findings to highlight areas for future research and discuss the similarities and differences between display evolution in anoles and in other lizard genera.

AB Traditionally, studies of intrasexual selection have focused on single traits that are more exaggerated in males. Relatively little is known about systems in which traits are larger in females or the role of multiple traits in male contests. We used a tournament design in which each male encounters a series of different opponents, in conjunction with the structured Bradley-Terry model, to examine the role of multiple male traits in contests between male Cape dwarf chameleons, Bradypodion pumilum. Females are larger but males have relatively longer tails, larger and more ornamented heads and a larger central flank patch, all of which are emphasized during agonistic displays. We found no evidence that larger body size confers an advantage in male contests, despite high levels of aggression and escalated encounters. However, both the height of the casque (head ornament) and relative area of the flank patch were positively associated with fighting ability, and not correlated with each other, suggesting that they may represent independent sources of information about an opponent's ability. We discuss these results in relation to the role of male contest competition in the evolution of multiple male signals and sexual dimorphism in dwarf chameleons. In addition, we show that the use of tournament designs, in conjunction with the structured Bradley-Terry model, has important advantages over traditional designs and methods of analysing animal contests.

AB Courting male fiddler crabs, Uca terpsichores, construct unusually large sand hoods at the entrances to their burrows to which they attract females for mating. Females sequentially visit several courting males before they stay with one and mate in his burrow, and they preferentially approach burrows with hoods. While moving between burrows, crabs are at risk of predation by birds and they sometimes run to objects that provide temporary cover. Thus, the female preference for burrows with hoods may help females to avoid predators. Could selection for predator avoidance produce a directional preference for especially large hoods? To examine this possibility, we made multiple replicas of two kinds of hood models with exaggerated dimensions (super models and wall models) and a single model with average dimensions (average models). Super models were four standard deviations taller and two standard deviations wider than average-size natural hoods. Wall models were of average height but near the maximum width of natural hoods; when males 'overbuild', they construct wall-like hoods. We replaced males' hoods with these models and measured their effects on male attractiveness. Males with exaggerated models neither encountered nor attracted more females than did males with average models or natural hoods. Females did not show a directional preference for larger hoods. The attractiveness of hoods may plateau with increasing size because discrimination between average and larger hoods may result in fatal hesitation, preventing the evolution of a directional preference for an exaggerated form of this courtship signal. Males build hoods from pure sand, so males may build unusually large hoods because they are more durable, not because they are better signals.

AB In animals such as birds that are capable of adjusting energy reserves behaviourally in response to starvation risk and predation risk, mass is a measure of an individual's perception of the risks in its environment. Although it is often necessary to capture and handle animals to allow the scientific study of animal behaviour, little is known about how this affects the individual's perception of the risks in its environment or how this changes subsequent behaviour. In this study we remotely monitored the mass of individual wild great tits, Pants major, for 10 days after capture, handling and release and then used starvation-predation risk trade-off theory to investigate how individuals perceived the risks in their environment. Mass increased significantly after capture and remained higher for 7 days before returning to precapture levels. We conclude that the capture and handling event was perceived as an interruption to foraging induced by an encounter with a predator which heightened starvation risk. Although this forced interruption to foraging was a relatively small proportion of available foraging time (< 6%), the subsequent response produced a large (66% of normal diurnal mass gain) and sustained change in mass. The results highlight the key role that foraging interruptions play in an individual's assessment of risks when trading off starvation against predation. They may also help to explain why some investigations of the effect of perceived predation risk on body mass in captive birds have produced inconsistent results.

AB Nestmate recognition among most social insects is thought to be mediated by cuticular hydrocarbons. We found that among two closely related ant species, the chemical cues used for recognition vary between them and that they are not cuticular hydrocarbons. Experiments with free-living colonies of Atta laevigata and Atta cephalotes using live and dead dummies, some impregnated with glandular extracts, allowed us to reconstruct the cues by which A. laevigata differentiates itself from A. cephalotes workers. The results suggest that the same odour cues (chemicals from the alarm pheromones and from abdominal exocrine secretions) are used for both inter- and intraspecific recognition systems, achieving discrimination of self (i.e. a nestmate) from others, and that both species differ in the chemical nature of the odour cues used for recognition. Our results suggest that recognition mechanisms vary among ants, and may thus vary among other social insects, and are shaped by various evolutionary forces in addition to kin selection.

AB Bustards vary considerably in sexual size dimorphism (SSD), ranging from reversed-dimorphic species (i.e. male < female) through monornorphic species to species in which an adult male can be three times heavier than an adult female. We used this unusual interspecific variation to test functional hypotheses of SSD using phylogenetic comparative methods. We found a strong allometric relation between SSD and body size that is consistent with Rensch's rule. We then tested whether the intensity of mating competition and the agility of male displays relate to SSD. First, the intensity of mating competition hypothesis predicts that males should be larger than females in species in which the males compete intensely for mates. As predicted, evolutionary changes towards more polygynous mating systems in bustards were associated with relatively larger males. Second, our results are also consistent with the aerial agility hypothesis, since in agile bustards the males tend to be smaller than females, whereas in nonagile bustards the males are usually larger. We also found that these two types of sexual selection have independent and statistically significant influences on SSD. We conclude that SSD in bustards is most consistent with sexual selection, and is influenced by both the intensity of sexual selection and the agility of male displays. Other hypotheses, however, such as fertility selection acting on females and differential use of niches by males and females remain untested.

AB Communicative interactions between colony members, or worker connectivity, can affect division of labour in insect societies. Nestmate workers of the eusocial paper wasp Polybia occidentalis engage in biting interactions and correlational evidence suggests that biting promotes foraging by the workers that are bitten. I used experimental forager removals to test whether biting is a form of worker connectivity, inducing new recruits to enter the foraging force. I observed colonies with marked workers during a pretreatment (control) period, then removed all arriving foragers on the following day. Foraging ceased after several hours of forager removals, and remained depressed on the following morning. I grouped the remaining workers into four behavioural categories: nonforagers, individuals that stopped foraging after the manipulation, continuing foragers that were active before and after the manipulation and recruited foragers that began foraging after the manipulation. After the manipulation, the recruited foragers were bitten at similar rates to the continuing foragers and, most importantly, were the only ones that were bitten at significantly increased rates after the manipulation. Most recruits were observed being bitten before they began foraging. However, some recruits were not observed being bitten, and worker responses to biting were often gradual. These patterns suggest that the effect of biting is to modulate the probability of foraging in bitten workers. The experiments show that biting helps to induce foraging. Biting is a form of worker connectivity, serving as a mechanism of communication between Polybia workers that affects colony responses to changing conditions.

AB For many ungulates, male reproductive success increases with social rank. Because rank is established through contests, it should be correlated with individual mass and select for high sexual dimorphism in body mass. It is difficult to weigh free-ranging ungulates, however, so empirical data on the relation between mass and social rank are scarce. We monitored individual mass and social rank of marked bighorn rams, Ovis canadensis, at Sheep River, Alberta, Canada over 5 years. Each year, rams were organized in a linear hierarchy. Social rank increased with age, and rank in one year was a good predictor of rank in the next year. The stability of dyadic relationships increased with the difference in age of individuals in the dyad but decreased as rams aged. Until about 6 years of age, the positive effects of age and individual mass on social rank were indistinguishable, because rams gained mass each year. The relation between body mass and social rank strengthened with age, probably because, after the heavier rams attain their lifetime asymptotic weight, they can challenge older conspecifics. In mature bighorn rams, social rank is a major determinant of reproductive success. By providing evidence that mass is an important determinant of rank, our study supports the contention that sexual selection leads to high sexual dimorphism in this species.

AB The acoustic environment has a major influence in shaping animal communication systems. Humans, particularly in cities, profoundly alter the acoustic structure of their environment. Recent articles have identified effects of noise on animal communication and behaviour. These studies, however, serve to highlight the surprising dearth of research on the behavioural responses of animals to altered acoustic environments. We argue that noise is not the only aspect of urban bioacoustics that researchers should explore. In addition to elevated noise levels, urban areas are characterized by a spatial heterogeneity in noise levels, predictable diurnal variation in noise levels and the existence of many vertical reflective surfaces. All of these characteristics have parallels in natural environments. We suggest that cities are a fruitful area for future research on the evolution of animal communication systems, with more general implications for conservation in human-altered environments.

AB Although considerable data are available on the subject for birds, almost nothing is known about the adaptive nature of paternal care in mammals. I studied the adaptive significance of paternal care in a socially monogamous population of bat-eared foxes, Otocyon megalotis. Between the birth and weaning of cubs males spent significantly more time in the den vicinity than females, and, with the exception of lactation, were involved in all aspects of tub care. Multivariate analyses revealed that, compared to parental size and age, territory quality and maternal den attendance, paternal den attendance was the best predictor of both the number and proportion of cubs surviving to weaning age. I suggest that the parental roles of bat-eared foxes are related to the species' diet, and propose that the beneficial nature of male care may be sufficient to make social monogamy the optimal mating strategy for males as well as females.

AB When territory owners temporarily leave their territories, intrusion often increases. Periodic returns (revisits) may reduce intrusion, but not necessarily, because this tactic might increase total time away from the territory. The effectiveness of revisits also depends on a subsequent delay in the return of intruders. Adult female yellowtail damselfish briefly leave their territories in the early morning every 3 days to spawn. Some females make a single trip; others return to their territory several times before they finish spawning. To determine how much time females spent on revisits and whether it reduced intrusion, we observed revisits by multiple-trip females and compared intrusion on the territories of spawning and experimentally caged single-trip and multiple-trip females. If revisits reduce intrusions, multiple-trip females should have higher intrusions when caged than when spawning. If revisits show adaptive plasticity, caged single-trip females should have lower intrusion rates than caged multiple-trip females. Not counting the first trip to the male's nest and the final return trip, we estimated that spawning multiple-trip females averaged 86% of their time at the male's nest, 11% back in the territory and 3% travelling. When owners were spawning, territories of both single- and multiple-trip fish received about 5-7 min of intrusion. When owners were caged, intrusion increased significantly only on territories of multiple-trip females. We consider this the first direct evidence that revisits during temporary absences reduce intrusion on territories, suggesting that revisiting is a plastic trait that females may vary in response to intruder pressure.

AB The rapid increase in the understanding of biological communication has been largely theory driven. Game-theoretical models have completely changed how behavioural biologists think about communication. These theories are widely cited, but much of the theoretical work remains only vaguely understood by the wide majority of those who make use of it. Critical terms and concepts have not been sufficiently well defined to provide a solid common foundation for theoretical work as a unified whole. In this paper, we synthesize the relevant theoretical work, and describe its relation to more classical thinking within the study of animal behaviour. We present a taxonomy of biological communication and signals. This taxonomy is based upon the structure and properties of extensive-form game models of communication. We then classify many influential models of communication according to the structure of their extensive-form representations. Finally, we link signal taxonomy and extensive form to show how the temporal structure of a modelled interaction determines the type of signal the model will produce. We argue that this intuitive form of modelling is the correct one for unifying terminology and theory. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ability to recognize a potential predator and display adaptive antipredator behaviour is crucial to the survival of prey animals. Prey should gain a fitness advantage by displaying antipredator responses with an intensity that matches their risk of predation. Understanding how such responses develop is the focus of our current study. Many prey fish do not show innate recognition of predators. Thus, learning is necessary and a strong selection pressure should exist to make learning as efficient as possible. In this study we investigated the ability of predator-naive fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, to learn to recognize an unknown predator, brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis. First, we conditioned minnows to recognize charr odour by exposing them to various concentrations of chemical alarm cues simultaneously with the odour of the charr and we subsequently tested them for recognition of this odour as a predation threat. Our objective was to test whether there was a match between the intensity of their antipredator responses during conditioning and recognition trials. Second, we tested whether minnows could learn to recognize charr through cultural transmission (i.e. by observing a conspecific responding to the odour of the predator) and we tested for a correlation between the intensity of response of the tutors during conditioning and the intensity of the learned responses by the observers during recognition trials. For both learning modes, the intensity of the response during the conditioning phase was retained during subsequent recognition trials. Our results suggest that minnows learn to respond more intensely to predation cues associated with high risk. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pin-tailed whydahs, Vidua macroura, parasitize the parental care of common waxbills, Estrilda astrild, throughout southern Africa. Unlike most avian brood parasites, pin-tailed whydah nestlings resemble host young, precisely matching their elaborate gape patterns. Presumably, similarity arises through selection on parasites to avoid discrimination by host parents, but the mechanisms of this selection remain elusive. To investigate the capabilities of common waxbill parents to discriminate variation in nestling morphology, I manipulated the gape flanges of their chicks. Despite substantial overall nestling mortality, I found no significant differences in survival among young whose gape flanges were coloured black, were treated with a clear sham control, or were left unmanipulated. In addition, parents did not selectively eliminate chicks with conspicuous, natural gape pattern irregularities. I did find small but significant differences in growth between black and control + unmanipulated groups for two metrics (mass and head + bill length) but not for two others (tarsus and wing length). I also manipulated the costs to parents of provisioning young by clipping their flight feathers at some nests, a procedure that should have increased the probability of rejecting young with manipulated gapes. Counter to prediction, nestlings tended to survive better in nests where parents were handicapped. Common waxbill parents, like parents in many bird species, appear to respond to variation in chick phenotypes by adjusting provisioning rates towards young. This discriminatory behaviour may help to explain the detailed similarity of common waxbill nestlings and pin-tailed whydahs. 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI State-dependent learning and suboptimal choice: when starlings prefer
   long over short delays to food
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID REWARD
AB Recent studies have used labels such as 'work ethics', 'sunk costs' and 'state-dependent preferences' for apparent anomalies in animals' choices. They suggest that preference between options relates to the options' history, rather than depending exclusively on the expected payoffs. For instance, European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, trained to obtain identical food rewards from two sources while in two levels of hunger preferred the food source previously associated with higher hunger, regardless of the birds' state at the time of testing. We extended this experimentally and theoretically by studying starlings choosing between sources that differed not only in history but also in the objective properties (delay until reward) of the payoffs they delivered. Two options (PF and H) were initially presented in single-option sessions when subjects were, respectively, prefed or hungry. While option PF offered a delay until reward of 10 s in all treatments, option H delivered delays of 10, 12.5, 15 and 17.5 s in four treatments. When training was completed, we tested preference between the options. When delays in both options were equal (10 s), the birds strongly preferred H. When delay in H was 17.5 s, the birds were indifferent, with intermediate results for intermediate treatments. Preference was not mediated by disrupted knowledge of the delays. Thus, preferences were driven by past state-dependent gains, rather than by the joint effect of the birds' state at the time of choice and knowledge of the absolute properties of each alternative, as assumed in state-dependent, path-independent models of optimal choice.

AB We used five Drosophila melanogaster recurrent F1s to investigate genotypic differences in space use and movement patterns, focusing on the behaviour of teneral females and individually marked young adults that were allowed free access to large, structurally complex environments. Teneral females from the five F1s differed in their propensity to hide after emergence and in the height at which they perched above the substrate. During the first 2 weeks of adult life, F1s of both sexes showed consistent differences in site fidelity, the proportion of time spent in areas located far from food items, and their choice of substrate when perching near food items. As larvae, these same five F1s differed with respect to the distances travelled while foraging, distances moved after disturbance at natal fruits, and pupation distance from natal fruits. The results of this study may help to shed light on related questions involving this species, including the effects of natal experience on habitat preference, and the effect of structural features near pupation sites on the ability of teneral females to avoid predators or forced copulations.

AB In long-lived bird species, a deferred onset of reproduction is assumed to be linked with a so-called prospecting phase when young individuals compare potential breeding sites before they decide to settle in the home area or to emigrate. However, this has rarely been documented with empirical data because of technical difficulties in collecting sufficient data from nonbreeding individuals at several sites. In the long-lived common tern, we used a novel transponder system to identify remotely all natal prospectors visiting two colonies of different size throughout the breeding season in 2001. Males attended the colonies about twice as frequently as females. Independently of sex, the proportion of birds recorded at both colonies was much higher among individuals born at the smaller colony. In the first half of their attendance time, individuals moved twice as often between colonies as in the second half. In both sexes, prospectors clearly favouring the larger colony were much more likely to breed there in the following season than prospectors with no clear colony choice, whereas no individual favouring the smaller colony during prospecting bred subsequently at the larger colony. Among birds born at the smaller colony, a higher proportion of female than of male prospectors attended mainly the larger colony, whereas among prospectors born in the larger colony, we did not find any sexual difference in attendance patterns and most birds favoured their home colony. The study suggests that prospectors select future breeding sites and that differences in philopatry between sexes are influenced by environmental quality.

AB Two major hypotheses of host-parasite interactions have been proposed to explain cases where hosts do not defend themselves against parasites. The evolutionary lag hypothesis suggests that there has been insufficient time for a host response to evolve, whereas the evolutionary equilibrium hypothesis proposes that host defence does not evolve because it carries costs that outweigh the benefits. We tested potential benefits and costs of host defence in an unusual interaction, between a freshwater fish, the European bitterling, Rhodeus sericeus, and live unionid mussels that are used as hosts for the fish's eggs. We found a significant reduction in ventilation rate of mussels that were incubating bitterling embryos, which became more severe with an increasing number of embryos. We tested the hypothesis that the risk of ejecting a mussel's own larvae while ejecting bitterling embryos has constrained the evolution of a host response. This predicts that brooding female mussels would retain more bitterling larvae than males or nonbrooding females. This prediction was not supported: brooding female mussels contained as many larvae per accessible gill as, and fewer in total than, males or nonbrooding females. In summary, based on the costs and benefits of ejection that we measured, we found no evidence in support of the evolutionary equilibrium hypothesis. However, other differences between mussel species, such as gill structure as measured in this study, ventilation rates and differences in the distance eggs are lodged into the gills, may contribute to differences in egg ejection rates.

AB In stable and predictable environments, grazing herbivores can use spatial memory to increase foraging efficiency. As most natural systems are characterized by unpredictability in the distribution of resources, we explored the foraging efficiency of sheep, Ovis aries, in relation to variability in spatial distribution of resources, predicting that as the environment became more variable, spatial memory would be replaced by sampling behaviour. We manipulated resource distribution by using bowls of food pellets to create seven preferred resource sites within a grass pasture. The provisioning of the bowls with pellets and the mass of pellets therein were altered to create four treatments in which resources remained stable or varied within and between resource sites. Where bowl position was predictable, sheep showed increased foraging efficiency by reducing the time devoted to pellet foraging in relation to the total mass of pellets consumed and by visiting fewer empty bowls while searching within a site. Where bowl position became less predictable, sheep increased sampling within sites, visiting more empty bowls before leaving a site. However, in contrast with previous observations, sheep did not return preferentially to the highest-quality sites within the test plot. This study suggests that sheep could use spatial memory at small spatial scales to improve foraging efficiency where resource distribution is predictable. The ability to switch between foraging tactics may allow sheep to maintain foraging success under variable conditions. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Despite its importance to mating system evolution, sexual selection and reproductive isolation, little is known about the genetic basis of female mate choice. We studied the behavioural and genetic basis of interspecific mate discrimination in Nasonia wasps, using two strains of N. longicornis (LCa and LId) that differ in female acceptance of males from the sibling species N. vitripennis. Both strains showed low acceptance (<= 2%) of N. vitripennis males in the first courtship, but acceptance by LId females subsequently increased (11% by the second and 15% by the third courtship), whereas acceptance by LCa females remained low (:! 2%). After 2 h of exposure to a N. vitripennis male, 59% of LId females mated compared with only 8% of LCa females. Interstrain cross F1 females showed significantly higher acceptance of N. vitripennis males than either parental strain in the first courtship (15-29%) and after 2 h (79-82%). A genetic analysis of acceptance at 2 h revealed three major quantitative trait loci (QTL). For each major QTL, the allele that increased female mate acceptance was dominant. The QTL with the largest effect accounted for half the strain difference, and was confirmed by additional crosses. This QTL was involved in the females' continued reluctance to mate with N. vitripennis males during multiple courtships. Results are discussed in terms of the behavioural and genetic architecture of female mate discrimination and possible implications to the evolution of courtship, mating systems and reproductive isolation.

AB Current theory suggests that most animal behaviours are the product of complex interactions between learning and inheritance. Optimal foraging theory predicts that animals should alter their foraging tactics depending on abundance and quality of available prey, and that at least some components of foraging behaviour must be heritable. Successful foraging behaviour, therefore, may require an individual to become an efficient predator on several novel prey types throughout its lifetime, and such aptitude may have a genetic basis. We examined foraging behaviour of the red-backed salamander to test two main hypotheses: (1) that salamanders at each of three age classes (neonates, yearlings and adults) would increase their foraging efficiency with increasing exposure to novel prey and (2) that various foraging parameters would have a genetic component. All age classes showed a significant increase in foraging efficiency after their first exposure to a novel prey type. Significant clutch differences and heritability estimates suggest that some aspects of foraging (e.g. prey recognition and latency to prey capture) may be influenced by genetics. Individuals that captured fewer prey items as neonates were less likely to survive to become yearlings under standardized laboratory conditions. This suggests that genetic variation in foraging efficiency may be directly related to future fitness (i.e. may influence mortality rates). This study indicates that learning, at all ages, plays an important role in successful foraging and that differences in foraging efficiency between individuals may have a genetic component.

AB Theoretical models predict that in species with obligate biparental care, individuals will partially compensate for decreased parental effort by their partners as a stable evolutionary strategy. Full compensation may occur when breeding success is an accelerating function of parental effort, especially in long-lived bird species. We experimentally examined the effect of time-depth recorders (TDRs) on body mass and parental behaviour of thick-billed murres, Uria lomvia, and evaluated the effect of TDRs as handicaps to test whether individuals compensate for decreased partner effort and whether compensation is sex biased. Compared with control birds, TDR-equipped birds had reduced body mass, offspring attendance, number of foraging trips and feeding rates, and males had increased foraging trip duration. in general, males lost mass at a higher rate and made longer foraging trips than females. Partners of TDR-equipped birds compensated for their mates' reduced parental effort by increasing offspring attendance and by increasing chick provisioning above average rates of control birds. Although partners of TDR-equipped birds fully compensated for their mates' reduced offspring attendance (i.e. chicks were never observed to be left unattended), total provisioning rates of pairs with a TDR-equipped bird ((X) over bar +/-SE=4.38+/-0.26 meals/day) were significantly lower than those of control pairs (5.74+/-0.31 meals/day). However, fledgling success of control and TDR-equipped birds did not differ between reproductive seasons. TDR-equipped birds also had a significantly lower rate of return to breed than their non-TDR-equipped partners or control birds, and those that did return the following season were more likely to change mates (32%) compared with controls (0%). Taken together, our results underline the need to quantify the effects of monitoring equipment used to measure seabirds' activities, and indicate the ability of female and male thick-billed murres to compensate for reduced partner effort due to handicapping-Compensator behaviour seems to be a necessary response of this single-brooded species to ensure current breeding success; however, it may affect the stability of pair bonds in some individuals.

   BEHAVIOR; MUTANT
AB Male fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, produce a complex courtship display, which females may use to identify conspecifics and to aid in choosing a high-quality mate. Courtship song, consisting of sine and pulse elements, is an important acoustic component of this display. Whereas characteristics that differ between species have been identified, the signals used for intraspecific mate choice remain unknown, as does the function of sine song. To investigate further the role of pulse and sine song, we varied characteristics of artificial and edited songs and played them to groups of flies to determine whether sine or pulse song parameters contribute to female mate choice. Playing artificial songs did not substantially change the amount of male courtship behaviour. Sine song in any proportion had no effect on female mating propensity, nor was mating affected by sine-song frequency. The amount of pulse song offered positively increased mating, up to a threshold, without regard to the structure of the song, pulse carrier frequency, or interpulse interval. These results indicate that females use pulse song, not sine song, for both species identification and intraspecific mate choice. Males may continue to produce sine song as a relic, as a by-product of a physiological process or because it is inextricably linked to a mate-choice signal in a different modality. The role of song memory is discussed briefly. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The black coucal is the only known altricial bird species in which females mate with and lay eggs for more than one male and males are responsible for all parental care (classical polyandry). In this species, the left testis is atrophied and it has been speculated that this may result in a reduction of circulating androgens, providing a unique mechanism for reversals in sex roles. We therefore investigated whether there is a reversal in circulating androgens and oestrogens in black coucals. Despite the reversals in sex roles, males had significantly higher levels of plasma testosterone than females, in a pattern typical of that of monogamous male passerines. Testosterone levels of both sexes were higher during the mating than during the premating stage and were low in males during the nestling stage. The concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and oestradiol did not differ between the sexes and were generally low. A physiological challenge with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) resulted in a significant increase in testosterone in males but not in females, suggesting either that females are not responsive to GnRH or that they express patterns of testosterone that are similar to those of males of species with a polygynous mating system without paternal care, in which testosterone is expressed at maximum levels throughout the breeding season. We conclude that the absence of one testis does not provide a mechanism for sex role reversal in black coucals. Either androgens are not involved in the regulation of male-like traits in females or females are sensitive to relatively low levels of these steroids.

AB Animal movement between habitat patches is often considered a random process. However, responses to landscape heterogeneity can direct the movement of animals and affect connectivity patterns. Topographical heterogeneity is a major source of habitat heterogeneity, which often directs animal movements and yet is scarcely studied in the context of dispersal. We investigated the mechanisms of response to topography and movement rules, using hilltopping as a behavioural case study. Hilltopping is a mate-searching strategy where males and virgin or multiple-mating females seek a topographical summit on which to mate. Mated females descend from the summits thereafter to search for host plants. We investigated the behavioural rules of hilltopping in males and virgin females of the butterfly Melitaea trivia, and female postmating movements. We released butterflies in different topographical formations, in a landscape that contained no larval host plants. We followed them individually, mapped the flight routes, and analysed them with respect to the surrounding landscape, using a Digital Elevation Model. Males and virgin females initiated hilltopping behaviour only in the absence of other individuals. After an initial orientation phase, butterflies flew towards the maximal inclination available. However, some downward movements interrupted the upward flight. When arriving at or released on a summit, males strongly adhered to it. After copulating, females showed little response to topography. Males and virgin females responded to topographical cues within about 50 m of their location. Our results show that nonrandom movements, such as hilltopping, are based on simple and predictable decision rules. We discuss the relation between hilltopping and dispersal, and the implications for modelling dispersal. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Alternative territorial tactics may be part of a broader behavioural tendency that can influence the expression of other behavioural traits. We compared the exploratory and predator avoidance behaviours of territorial and floater male water skinks, Eulamprus heatwolei, to identify whether these alternative behavioural tactics are part of a broader behavioural dichotomy. Floater and territorial males differed in their tendencies to explore novel habitats. Floaters spent less time in the refuge, moved further and ate more mealworms when placed in a novel enclosure, suggesting that floaters were less wary of the novel environment and had greater exploratory tendencies. Predator avoidance behaviours also differed between the two groups of males. Territorial lizards were less likely to retreat to a refuge site during a simulated predator attack, returned faster to a basking site after this attack and as a result had a smaller net reduction in preattack body temperature. These results may be attributed to the trade-off that territorial lizards face between territorial defence and antipredator behaviour, which floaters do not experience. Our results suggest that territorial tactics may be part of a broader behavioural tendency that can influence the expression and evolution of other seemingly unrelated traits.

AB The echolocation calls of bats function in prey capture and navigation but are not commonly regarded as communicative signals. However, because bats' echolocation calls show patterns of variability, they may transmit information about a bat, such as its age, individual identity or sex. For echolocation calls to function in this manner, variation in calls must be reliably linked to the characteristics of the bat, as has been shown in a number of studies. However, few studies have asked whether bats respond to this variation. We tested whether female big brown bats can identify the sex of an unfamiliar bat from playbacks of its echolocation calls. Playback consisted of a 30-s preplayback period, a 60-s playback period of either male or female echolocation calls, and a 30-s postplayback period. In the playback and postplayback periods the vocalization rates of female bats changed significantly relative to the preplayback period depending on the sex of the playback stimulus, indicating that they could determine sex from the echolocation calls. These findings support the possibility that echolocation calls play a role in communication in big brown bats. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Group-specific communication signals are found in many group-living species. One example is group variation in ' the production of codas, which are short stereotyped patterns of clicks produced in social contexts, by sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus. However, little is known about how codas are used by groups and individuals. We used the multipulse structure of sperm whale clicks to estimate the size of animals producing codas. Recordings of a single social unit containing nine largely unrelated animals made over a 1-month period yielded 879 codas of 32 distinctive types. We used an automatic technique to measure the interpulse interval of the clicks in these codas because the interpulse interval is closely related to the size of the animal. Ninety-four codas had sufficiently accurate measurements to be included in further analysis. Modes in the distribution of these measurements showed that more than one animal was producing codas. Comparing the measurements within coda types revealed that several coda types were produced by more than one animal. Thus, the codas recorded from these animals represent a shared repertoire, whereby coda production is not limited to a single animal and coda types are shared between individuals within the unit.

Water depth was significantly greater by lodges with a food cache than at lodges lacking a food cache. There was no significant difference in watercourse width between the two groups. Date of initiation of the food cache was not related to water depth, but beavers living by wider watercourses started constructing food caches before those living on narrow watercourses. Finite size of food caches was significantly related to watercourse width and time of initiation.

   SIZE; POPULATION; INDICATOR
AB Many animals have multiple sexual ornaments, a fact variously explained as signalling of multiple attributes, or nonadaptive retention of now redundant, but previously informative, signals. Despite the widespread occurrence of multiple ornaments, and the theoretical interest in how they are maintained by selection, there have been few experimental studies of the phenomenon. We investigated the role of two ornaments, each plausibly signalling different male attributes, in attracting a new mate in the Kentish plover, Charadrius alexandrinus. Previously we have shown that male Kentish plovers vary in how long they take to acquire a new mate, and we hypothesized that this variation may relate to their attractiveness or parental ability. We created single males by removing their mate and clutch, and then manipulated both their badge size (a presumed signal of either their genetic quality or their dominance status and hence defensive abilities) and the length of their flank feathers (a presumed signal of their parental quality in incubation) in a 2 X 2 factorial design. We found no difference in remating times between manipulated and control males. Furthermore, neither body size nor body condition of males was related to their remating times, although males with enlarged badges spent less time fighting than control males. Taken together, our results suggest that female Kentish plovers do not use either badge size or the length of flank feathers as cues in their mate choice decisions. However, badge size may influence male-male competition. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adrenal glucocorticoid (GC) secretion is an important component of the response to stress in vertebrates. A short-term increase in circulating GCs serves to redirect energy from processes that can be briefly curtailed without harm, allowing energy to be directed towards eliminating or avoiding the stressor. In contrast, prolonged elevation of GCs can cause a broad range of pathologies, including reproductive suppression. We examined whether social subordination in wolves leads to chronically elevated GC levels, and whether this,social stress' causes reproductive suppression of subordinates in cooperatively breeding species. Behavioural and endocrine data collected over 2 years from three packs of free-living wolves in Yellowstone National Park did not support this hypothesis. GC levels were significantly higher in dominant wolves than in subordinates, for both sexes, in all packs, in both years of study. Unlike other cooperatively breeding carnivores (e.g. dwarf mongooses, Helogale parvula, and African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus), high GCs in dominant wolves were not associated with high rates of aggression or agonistic interaction. Aggression increased for wolves of all ranks during mating periods, accompanied by a significant rise in GC levels. If chronic elevation of GCs carries fitness costs, then social stress in wolves (and many other social species) is a cost of dominance, not a consequence of subordination. The specific behavioural correlates of dominance that affect GC levels appear to vary among species, even those with similar social systems.

AB Birds are thought to choose nest sites that meet two main functions: providing security to both nest contents and incubating adults, and providing an appropriate microclimate for incubation. Many shorebirds nest in sites with no or little cover. in a lake in southern Spain, nearly 70% of the nests of Kentish plovers, Charadrius alexandrinus, were in sites with little or no cover, where ambient temperatures might be more than 50degreesC during very hot days, thus causing the incubating adults to suffer from heat stress. We tested the hypothesis that Kentish plovers nest mainly in exposed sites because this may allow the incubating birds to detect approaching predators early, and thus to reduce predation risk. When we occluded the view that incubating adults had from their nests, they took longer to detect approaching predators than when the view was unrestricted. Incubating adults were also more frequently killed by mammals in covered than in exposed nests. Females that nested in covered sites were in lower body condition than those nesting in exposed sites, possibly because they were unable to withstand the high ambient temperatures in exposed sites. Thus, the benefits of thermally favourable nest sites are reduced by the constraints of predation risk. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sexual selection has played a major role in shaping the wide variety of mating patterns found in species with separate sexes, but little is known about its effects on simultaneous hermaphrodites. However, many hermaphrodites possess complex reproductive systems and mating behaviour is often elaborate, suggesting that some form of mate assessment takes place. We found that the marine slug Aeolidiella glauca, a simultaneous hermaphrodite with reciprocal external sperm transfer via spermatophores, shows a unique mate choice behaviour by avoiding mating with conspecifics already carrying a spermatophore received during the previous mating. Current mating status did not seem to affect this behaviour, because both slugs that had mated 2-3 days before our mate choice trials and slugs that had been isolated for 4-6 weeks avoided spermatophore-carrying partners. There are two obvious reasons why slugs should avoid recently mated partners. First, they may reduce the risk of getting a partner depleted in self-sperm. Second, the risk of sperm competition may be decreased. Histological investigations of sperm reserves suggest that sperm depletion did not influence our mate choice experiments. Most slugs had sufficient sperm stored for spermatophore production. Therefore, the most likely explanation for A. glauca's peculiar mate choice is that, by avoiding a recently mated partner, a sperm donor may reduce its risk of being subjected to sperm competition.

   PREFERENCES; EXPRESSION; SIGNALS; REDNESS; MODELS
AB The coevolution of extravagant male traits and female mate preferences is a central tenet of sexual selection theory. In lineages in which males have developed more elaborate sexual characters, females favour the most extreme expression of the trait. In some taxa, however, ornamental displays have evolved from more to less exaggerated states. Under these circumstances, it is unclear whether females show preferences for an ancestral male condition or for the current, less elaborate display. Here, we tested female mate preferences relative to male ornamental coloration in two species of cardueline finch (the American goldfinch, Carduelis tristis, and pine siskin, Carduelis pinus) that have evolved less elaborate carotenoid-based colour displays from more elaborately coloured ancestral states. We presented females of each species with a choice of males having either large patches of red colour (the elaborate, ancestral condition) or with species-typical patches of yellow colour (the less elaborate, derived state). Female goldfinches and siskins showed consistent preferences for the natural colour displays of males, and not for the more elaborate, ancestral colour pattern. Previous research on another cardueline finch taxon (a subspecies of the house finch, Carpodacus mexicanus griscomi), however, showed that females prefer more elaborate, ancestral coloration to the current form of reduced colour expression. The lack of congruence between male trait expression and female trait preference in the lineage with the most recently derived reduction in trait expression suggests that there may be evolutionary lags in the correspondence between male traits and female preferences. A shift in the expression of male coloration appears to be the first step towards the evolution of reduced colour displays in these finches.

AB The costs and benefits of group membership vary with the size of groups, and individuals are expected to modify their choice of groups in response to ecological factors such as food availability and predation risk. We experimentally examined context-dependent group size choice in a shoaling fish, the banded killifish, Fundulus diaphanus, by using nondirectional odour cues to simulate a food source or a successful attack by a predator (food or alarm treatments) in the laboratory. Group sizes were significantly smaller in the food treatment and larger in the alarm treatment than in control trials. When presented with food and alarm cues together, fish formed groups that were larger than control groups but smaller than those seen with alarm cues alone. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions based on the known benefits and costs of grouping and with previous laboratory work examining the individual shoal choice behaviour of single fish. To examine possible mechanisms of group formation, we developed an individual-based model of shoaling behaviour in which simulated fish were allowed to modify the area over which they interacted with neighbouring individuals. Group size distributions produced by the model were a good approximation of our experimental data. We suggest that local behavioural interaction rules of this type are a potential mechanism by which fish may individually adjust grouping behaviour without requiring extensive information on the position and movement of all possible shoalmates.

AB Chemical alarm cues released from injured tissue are not released under any other context and therefore reliably inform nearby prey of the presence of a predator. Laboratory and field studies have demonstrated that most aquatic taxa show antipredator responses to chemical alarm cues. Ostariophysan fish (e.g. minnows) possess specialized skin cells that contain an alarm chemical. Magurran et al. (1996, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 263, 1551-1556) were the first to use underwater video to carefully document the behavioural response of free-ranging wild populations of minnows to minnow alarm cues. They found no evidence of an antipredator response, and challenged the assumption that the contents of these cells indicate risk in the field. They proposed that alarm responses are context dependent in that they are an artefact of enclosed environments such as laboratory aquaria and field traps. Here, we repeat their experiment on free-swimming field populations of littoral fish and report a significant decrease in the number of fish in areas where chemical alarm cues of blacknose shiners, Notropis heterolepis (Ostariophysi: Cyprinidae) were released. The effect of these chemical cues was equal in magnitude to the effect of the presentation of a model predator. The response to the approach of a model predator (visual cue) was intensified by pre-exposure to chemical alarm cues. We corroborated this interaction between chemical and visual indicators of predation risk in a laboratory study using glowlight tetras, Hemigrammus erythrozorms (Ostariophysi: Characidae). Response to the visual stimulus of a predator was significantly intensified by previous exposure to conspecific chemical alarm cues. We conclude that ostariophysan skin indeed contains an alarm cue that (1) informs nearby prey of imminent predation risk, (2) induces some form of antipredator behaviour in most contexts, and (3) affects subsequent behavioural responses to stimuli in other sensory modalities.

AB We call for renewed emphasis on the tasks confronting animals as they develop and learn. We are extending the use of the term 'developmental ecology' employed by plant biologists who have studied how fitness can be influenced by the ecological context present during development (Watson et al. 2001, Evolutionary Ecology, 15, 425-442). We seek an expanded venue for the term, arguing that for animal behaviourists to understand some of the traits so familiar in behavioural ecology, they must consider the fundamental phenomena of development. Not doing so runs the risk of misidentifying both the proximal and functional causes of traits. For example, without a developmental view, macrogeographical variation in species-typical behaviour may be viewed as evidence of genotypic differences when, in fact, the variation is being produced by developmental contexts. Detailed below are some general issues about how development can be studied if it is to contribute to our knowledge of the adaptive value of behavioural systems. We argue for a prospective and longitudinal orientation, with an emphasis on relatively continuous observation and measurement. Both behaviours and contexts that may only occur during ontogeny are examined, as well as the reproductive outcome of the traits of interest. We present examples from our work on courtship and communication in brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, to show that a prospective and ecological view of development reveals pronounced variation in patterns of reproductive behaviour that cannot be understood without taking into account developmental ecology.

AB The role of scent marking in the social communication of mammals is widely variable. One reason for this variation is that the function of scent marking may vary with different ecological and social conditions. The purpose of this study was to test four nonexclusive hypotheses explaining the role of scent-marking frequency in different ecological and social contexts for wild golden lion tamarins. Relative to ecological contexts, we compared scent-marking frequency during seasons of abundant and scarce food resources. Relative to social contexts, we compared scent-marking frequency when groups were isolated and when groups were in the presence of neighbouring groups. We found that the tamarins used scent marking to mark the location of food resources. Additionally, males used scent marking to communicate intrasexual dominance within their groups, while females did not. Our results also indicate that alpha females increased their scent-marking frequency to communicate to members of other groups, while the presence of members of other groups did not elicit a similar response by alpha males. We did not find evidence for a territorial function of scent marking in golden lion tamarins.

AB Under predation risk, prey may prioritize antipredator behaviours and sacrifice feeding. However, energetically constrained animals may choose to sacrifice or change antipredator responses and accept relatively greater risk in order to secure food. In this last case, the antipredator tactics chosen must balance safety and feeding in such a way that costs are minimized and benefits maximized. We studied the antipredator behaviour of pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) subjected to different periods of food deprivation, against the parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). As the energetic internal stress of aphids increased, the predominant antipredator response changed from walking away and dropping to kicking behaviour, and parasitization avoidance decreased. Parasitoids did not show preference between food-deprived and nonfood-deprived aphids. Dropping and walking away reduced parasitization from 50 to 33%. These results support the hypothesis that the antipredator behaviour of an aphid changes as a function of internal stress. By performing less costly behaviour such as kicking under energetically constrained conditions, aphids seem to minimize their probability of energy shortfall. Given that aphid antipredator behaviour is a function of nutritional state, its occurrence under natural conditions may match host quality spatial distribution.

AB Pair formation and breeding in many species of waterfowl are separated both temporally and spatially. Most studies of female choice in this group have focused on male characteristics at the time of pairing, with less attention given to how mate choice affects breeding season outcomes. In this study I compared pairing success, male plasma testosterone level and mate-guarding ability of male mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, in two experiments. In the first experiment females and males were group housed with equal sex ratios, thus allowing all of these males to pair. At the same time, an equal number of males was housed in groups without access to females and remained unpaired. In this experiment testosterone levels of paired and unpaired males during autumn (baseline) and spring (breeding) did not differ, indicating that the process of pair formation and breeding does not cause elevated spring testosterone levels in males. However, testosterone did temporarily decrease in paired males during the winter (pair formation) season. In the second experiment groups were male biased, allowing only half of the males to pair. Here paired males had significantly higher testosterone levels than unpaired males during the breeding season, but not during the preceding autumn. Together the results of these experiments indicate that successful pair formation predicts but does not alter male testosterone level during the breeding season. I also found that females paired to males with high levels of testosterone were missing fewer feathers due to forced copulation attempts by nonmates, suggesting that females may choose males based on their mate-guarding abilities.

AB The diet choice of large herbivores is influenced by the presence of nutrients and toxins in available plants. It is generally assumed that herbivores ingest food that contains higher amounts of nutrients and lower amounts of toxins than the average of the food available. We studied the effects of quality and relative abundance on food choice in fallow deer, Dama dama. Preferences for and aversions against different compounds were first examined in two-choice tests with food and water. We then did cafeteria (multiple-choice) tests with hydrolysable tannin and sucrose added to food to investigate the influence of the frequency of occurrence. We found that food choice was biased towards lower tannin content. Consumption with respect to tannin content was relative rather than absolute, however, in that the intake of a given concentration depended on which other concentrations were present. In addition, the relative preference for low-tannin food was weaker in the cafeteria test, where this food had a smaller frequency of occurrence, indicating that frequency of occurrence influences food choice. We discuss these results from the perspective of optimal foraging theory and suggest that a changing and complex distribution of food types in nature may make it advantageous for large herbivores to show intermediate selectivity, rather than attempting to ingest only the highest quality food possible.

AB The possession of armour may affect escape behaviour in two ways.. On one hand, by decreasing vulnerability to predators, armour may permit individuals to use habitats and behaviours that are too risky for unarmoured individuals. Alternatively, the possession of armour may have negative trade-offs on other traits involved in antipredator behaviour, such as sprint speed, thus constraining antipredator options relative to those available to unarmoured individuals. To examine these contrasting predictions, we examined species in the lizard family Cordylidae, which contains remarkable morphological diversity, ranging from completely unarmoured to heavily defended species. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicates that armour has been an evolutionarily labile trait. We found support for the second prediction. Degree of body armature was inversely correlated with distance run from a predator: heavily armoured species always entered refuges after short distances, whereas many unarmoured lizards continued to flee and could not be induced to enter a refuge. Possession of armour was also negatively related to use of vertical surfaces during escape behavour. These results were unchanged when analysed in a phylogenetic context. Thus, we conclude that the morphological requirements for active flight and armoured defence are incompatible. Heavily armoured species are bulky, have short legs and run more slowly than less armoured species. Rather than constituting an alternative to behavioural antipredator tactics, we conclude that the possession of armour is part of an antipredator syndrome that includes habitat use and behaviour as well as morphology.

AB In the polyandrous gift-giving butterfly Pieris napi, females mature at a smaller size than males under poor food conditions, so it has been suggested that females can compensate for their smaller size through nuptial feeding. We tested this hypothesis by assessing female polyandry in relation to female size in a study of a wild bivoltine population and in a laboratory experiment. Contrary to expectation, larger females had a higher mating frequency. In the wild population female polyandry was positively correlated with size and in the laboratory experiment larger females were also more polyandrous. Hence, smaller females cannot compensate for their size by increasing their mating frequency, perhaps because the rate of spermatophore breakdown sets the limit for polyandry and larger females are able to break down the spermatophore faster. In addition, the lifetime number of matings for wild females varied between one and five. As previous studies indicate that female fitness in P. napi appears to increase monotonically with number of mates as a result of the increase in spermatophore material received, it is surprising that 12% of the wild females in the oldest age classes had mated only once and that another 35-40% had mated only twice. This apparently maladaptive behaviour is discussed in terms of sexually antagonistic coevolution and whether environmental conditions influence optimal mating frequency.

AB Bumblebee workers vary greatly in size, unlike workers of most other social bees. This variability has not been adequately explained. In many social insects, size variation is adaptive, with different-sized workers performing different tasks (alloethism). Here we established whether workers of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera; Apidae), exhibit alloethism. We quantified the size of workers engaging in foraging compared to those that remain in the nest, and confirmed that it is the larger bees that tend to forage ((X) over bar +/- SE thorax widths 4.34 +/- 0.01 mm for nest bees and 4.93 +/- 0.02 mm for foragers). We then investigated whether large bees are better suited to foraging because they. are able to transport heavier loads of food back to the nest. Both pollen and nectar loads of returning foragers were measured, demonstrating that larger bees do return with a heavier mass of forage. Foraging trip times were inversely related to bee size when collecting nectar, but were unrelated to bee size for bees collecting pollen. Overall, large bees brought back more nectar per unit time than. small bees, but the rate of pollen collection appeared, to be unrelated to size. The smallest foragers had a nectar foraging rate close to zero, presumably explaining why foragers tend to be large. Why might larger bees be better at foraging? Various explanations are considered: larger bees are able to forage in, cooler conditions, may he able to forage over larger distances, and are perhaps also less vulnerable to predation. Conversely, small workers are presumably cheaper to produce and may be more nimble at within-nest tasks. Further research is needed to assess these,possibilities.

AB In two experiments, hungry rats, Rattus-norvegicus, were present in one side of an operant chamber while a conspecific demonstrator in the adjacent compartment moved a single lever either up or down for a food reward. During a subsequent test session, in which these rats were allowed access to the lever for the first time, all responses were rewarded regardless of their direction. In experiment 1, rats that were prevented from observing the direction of lever movement by mean's of a screen showed a reliable demonstrator-consistent response, bias, while rats that had observed the direction of lever movement and in addition, had access to any odour cues deposited on the lever did not. In experiment 2, each rat observed another rat (the 'viewed' demonstrator) moving a lever. either up or down. They were then transferred. into the test compartment of a different operant chamber in which another rat (the 'box' demonstrator) had moved the lever in the same direction as the viewed,demonstrator or in the opposite direction. These observer rats showed a reliable preference for their box demonstrator's direction, but responded in the opposite direction to their viewed demonstrator. Taken together, the results of these experiments suggest that directional responding by rats in a vertical movement two-action test is influenced by demonstrator-deposited odour cues in addition to visual experience of a demonstrator's behaviour. Furthermore, while odour-mediated local enhancement gave rise to demonstrator-consistent responding, visual observation of a. conspecific appeared to have the reverse effect.

AB It may be possible to exploit olfactory attachments shown by chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, to improve their welfare. In the present study, chicks were housed in groups of 15 in wooden boxes from I day of age. Experiment I compared fear responses in pairs of 8-10-day-old chicks with no previous experience of vanillin when they were exposed to an unfamiliar open field containing a dish of food in either the presence or absence of this odourant. The vanillin had no detectable effects. Chicks were housed similarly in experiment 2 but this time dishes containing vanillin were placed underneath the wire floor. We then asked if its presence would increase social dispersal and reduce fear when pairs of chicks were tested in the open field. At 8-10 days of age, two cagemates were placed close together in an open field in the presence of either the familiar odourant or a colour-matched solution of odourless food dyes (control). When the open field contained vanillin the chicks moved apart significantly sooner (minimum criterion=20 cm) and also tended to pace, preen and peck at the environment more often, although not significantly so; the proportions of pairs that moved apart and that fed were significantly greater. Novelty elicits fear and frightened chicks would be expected to move apart and to feed only when their fear levels had dissipated sufficiently. Our results confirm the existence of olfactory memories in domestic chicks, they suggest that behavioural modification reflected the familiarity of vanillin rather than any anxiolytic properties of this odourant per se, and they support our hypothesis that familiar odourants can act as reassuring agents in otherwise unfamiliar situations. These findings may have important implications for poultry welfare and productivity. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Optimality models designed to explain the occurrence of feeding territoriality predict that the frequency or intensity of aggression will peak at intermediate levels of food abundance. To test whether this prediction applies to the competition for ephemeral patches of food, we manipulated food abundance over a broad range of values in two separate experiments (24- and 64-fold, respectively) while monitoring the aggressive behaviour of juvenile convict cichlids, Archocentrus nigrofasciatum, competing for the food. In both experiments, the rate of aggression was low when food was scarce, increased as food abundance increased, and decreased when food was provided in excess. This dome-shaped pattern of aggression was caused partly by higher encounter rates between fish and partly by a higher proportion of encounters resulting in aggression, when food was at intermediate levels of abundance. Our results suggest that convict cichlids display behavioural flexibility: in response to changes in food abundance, they appear to change both their likelihood of using aggression when encountering a conspecific and their willingness to enter an occupied patch.

AB Acoustic signals are assumed to form the basis of manatee communication. Empirical evidence of individual vocal recognition has been reported. If manatees can recognize one another by acoustical means, it should be possible to identify individual vocal patterns. We recorded vocalizations of 14 individually housed Amazonian manatees and then digitized selected vocalizations, allowing seven variables to be measured and subjected to multivariate statistical treatment. Discriminant function analysis indicated that individuals can be separated on the basis of variables related to the fundamental frequency and signal duration. We observed significant differences in the vocal patterns between sexes and age classes. Females tended to have greater fundamental frequency and shorter note duration than males. Calves had shorter note durations and greater values for the fundamental frequency range than subadults and adults. An inverse relationship between total body length and fundamental frequency range suggests that the fundamental frequency becomes more defined as the animal ages. The similar individual patterns in the vocalizations of a mother and calf pair are discussed. Individual recognition by Amazonian manatees according to their vocal patterns is suggested through a preliminary playback experiment. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID VOCAL INTERACTIONS; NIGHTINGALES; AUDIENCE
AB Aggressive signalling interactions contain information that could be used by individuals other than those directly involved in the interaction. We investigated whether the relative information contained in such signalling interactions is used by others in a laboratory setting. Male fighting fish (subjects) were allowed to see three treatments, without themselves being seen. In the control treatment subjects saw two males that were not interacting. In the real interaction treatment the subjects saw two males interacting. In the apparent interaction treatment the two males could appear to the subject to be interacting but were actually interacting with males hidden from the subject's view. After observing a treatment the subject was allowed to interact visually with the two male 'opponents' in turn. In both interaction treatments the outcome of the interaction observed by the subject (i.e. whether the opponent won or lost) significantly affected the subject's aggressive response to the opponent, but more strongly in apparent interactions. Subjects responded to opponents that had apparently won with shorter latencies, more time spent near and displaying, more tail beats and attempted bites. No absolute measures of opponents were significantly related to the subjects' responses. Our results suggest that the level of aggression seen by eavesdroppers in interactions affects how they gather and use information. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Deceptive mimicry is one of several hypotheses for the evolution of song copying in oscine songbirds. This hypothesis predicts that a floater or immigrant male that sings local song types may be perceived as a territory owner and benefit from the reduced aggression commonly observed between established neighbours ('dear enemy' effect). The present study employed a field playback experiment to test the short-term ability of mimics to deceive territorial male song sparrows, Melospiza melodia. A set of three nonshared song type stimuli was presented to individual focal birds from the territory boundary of an adjacent male: a song type recorded from this adjacent neighbour (Neighbour), and two from nonneighbouring males that were an unfamiliar song type (Stranger) and a song type in the neighbour's repertoire (Mimic). The behavioural response to the Mimic was often as strong as, and sometimes stronger than, the response to the Stranger and was significantly more aggressive than to the Neighbour. Thus most birds accurately assessed the Mimic as a non-neighbouring invader. This study also revealed a significant negative correlation between the number of songs a subject shared with his neighbour and his aggressive response to the Neighbour stimulus. Song sharing is associated with reduced aggression between neighbours, but the mechanism is not deceptive mimicry. In this species with age-restricted learning, song sharing may serve as an indicator of a bird's competitive strength and ability to establish and maintain a territory near his adult song tutors.

AB The hypothesis of mate choice based on heterozygosity predicts that sexual traits will reach their extreme expression in males with the greatest average heterozygosity, and that both a male's ornament expression and his mating success will correlate positively with degree of individual heterozygosity. In agreement with the first prediction, we found a negative correlation between degree of homozygosity and length of the throat feathers (a secondary sexual trait) in male spotless starlings, Sturnus unicolor. However, we found a quadratic relationship between degree of homozygosity and both mating success and mean number of young sired per year. Hence, males of intermediate heterozygosity were more successful in mating and reproduction than either more homozygous or more heterozygous males. These results do not support the hypothesis of mate choice based on heterozygosity. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The moult of birds could greatly perturb the life cycle of feather mites (Astigmata). These mites live on the surface of feathers and are unlikely to survive if they are on one when it is moulted. Therefore, we hypothesized that they would escape to other feathers to avoid this risk of mortality. We analysed the distribution of feather mites on the wings of 63 moulting individuals of 13 species of passerine birds. We used generalized linear mixed models to test whether the distribution of feather mites depends on the stage of moult of feathers. Feather mites were significantly less abundant on the next feather to fall out than on the other feathers. This ability to escape seems to be higher on primaries and secondaries than on tertials. At least on primaries, feather mites avoided not only the next feather to be moulted but also the second one. For primaries and secondaries the new full-grown feathers harboured more feather mites than those still growing. This study shows that feather mites have an escape behaviour from moulting wing feathers in passerine birds that is consistent with a model of adaptive behaviour.

AB Humpback whale song, a male breeding display, shows a remarkable degree of similarity among distant breeding assemblages, despite constant progressive change. It has been hypothesized that whales maintain continuity through cultural transmission via migratory movements of mates. We examined songs of whales breeding off Hawaii and Mexico to determine whether they changed similarly in both areas during the course of a breeding season. Songs recorded off Kauai, Hawaii (11 individuals) and Isla Socorro, Mexico (13 individuals) during winter and spring of 1991, were compared qualitatively and quantitatively. We measured 44 acoustic variables describing all known levels of song structure for each singer and we grouped these variables into six categories. We used two-factor analyses of variance to assess change across the season in each area, comparing the two regions and two 3-week periods (January/February and April). Twenty-seven variables changed significantly during the 12-week study in at least one area. Variables within categories displayed similar trends of change. Time and frequency characteristics describing the structure of song elements (units and phrases) changed synchronously in each area, with 21 of 25 variables displaying significant differences between periods and no interaction with region. Structures of song patterns, as defined by frequency of occurrence and number of unit and phrase types, changed differently in each area, with five of 12 variables indicating a significant interaction between region and period. Our results may suggest cultural transmission during the season, since many variables changed in similar manners. We propose an alternative hypothesis, that whales may be predisposed to gradually change certain features of song independently of cultural influences; change of structural elements may be governed by a discrete set of rules, or according to an innate template. Therefore, continuity of song patterns across the ocean basin may be due to a combination of mechanisms, only partially involving cultural transmission. We assess these hypotheses in relation to humpback whale behaviour and population structure, and cultural transmission and evolution of avian song.

AB It is postulated that deep-water foraging in sperm whales, Physeter macrocephalus, has led to communal care of young and long-term female bonds. By studying the social organization of a second, unrelated, deep-diving species, the northern bottlenose whale, we investigated the role that deep diving may play in the evolution of cetacean sociality. Northern bottlenose whales in a deep-water canyon, the Gully off Nova Scotia, Canada, form small groups ((X) over bar +/- SD = 3.04 +/- 1.86). Associations within age/sex classes (female/immature, subadult male and mature male) were significantly higher than associations between different classes. Females and immature bottlenose whales formed a loose network of associations, showing no preferential associations with particular individuals or those from specific age/sex classes nor any long-term bonds. Mature and subadult males had stronger associations with individuals in their own class, and associations between some males lasted for several years, although males also formed many short-term associations. Overall the social organization of northern bottlenose whales in the Gully appears to resemble that of some bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, living in shallow, enclosed bays. Thus deep-water foraging does not appear to necessarily lead to the evolution of long-term bonds between females., (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Foragers can often show a broad range of strategies when searching for resources. The simplest foraging strategy is to search randomly within a habitat; however, foragers can often assess habitat quality over various spatial scales and use this information to keep themselves in, or direct themselves to, regions of high resource abundance or low predation risk. We investigated models that describe a population of consumers competing for a renewable resource that is distributed among discrete patches. Our aim was to identify what foraging strategy or strategies are expected to persist within a population, where strategies differ in the degree of habitat assessment (i.e. none, local, or global). We were interested in how the optimal strategies are dependent on the cost of assessment and habitat structure (i.e. the variation in renewal rates and predation risks among patches). The models showed that the simple random foraging strategy (i.e. make no habitat assessments) often persisted even when the cost of habitat assessment was low. Persistence could occur when habitat assessment and population dynamics generated an ideal free distribution because it could be exploited by the random foragers. Habitat assessment was more advantageous when consumers could not achieve ideal free distributions, which was more likely as patches became less productive. When productivity was low we sometimes observed the situation where different foraging strategies generated resource heterogeneities that promoted their coexistence, and this could occur even when all patches were intrinsically identical.

AB We used shore crabs, Carcinus maenas, feeding on molluscan prey as a model system for investigating the effects of previously learned handling skills on a predator's ability to subjugate novel prey. From transfer theory we predicted that crabs experienced with previous prey (dogwhelks, Nucella lapillus) requiring similar handling techniques to the novel prey (mussels, Mytilus edulis) should show positive skill transfer, enabling them to handle the novel prey more efficiently than naive controls (trained on fish). We predicted that crabs experienced with prey requiring dissimilar handling techniques (periwinkles, Littorina littorea) should show negative skill transfer, impairing their performance relative to controls. Crabs trained to dogwhelks performed better than controls when presented with mussels, whereas crabs trained to periwinkles performed similarly to controls. We conclude that crabs are able to transfer learned handling skills to novel prey requiring common elements of subjugation and suggest that negative transfer may occur only when tasks differ markedly in character.

AB For decades fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been considered a good descriptor of developmental stability. Correlations have been shown between FA and several fitness components, including mating success and heterozygosity level. However, some doubts have been expressed about the generalization of these results, perhaps because of bias towards positive results and a poor critical approach in the first phase of FA studies. Studies on Odonata are scarce and are concentrated on the Coenagrionidae family, with contrasting results in the relationships between FA and mating success, size and other fitness components. We investigated the relationships between FA expressed as right - left wing length (R - L), body size expressed as (R+L)/2, multilocus and single locus heterozygosity assessed by allozyme electrophoresis and short-term mating success (SMS) assessed from the status (mated or not) of the males at the moment of collection. We collected 260 males from a breeding population. The data were analysed by both univariate and multifactorial statistical methods. After excluding a correlation between FA and body size, we checked the presence of a true FA by using tests for normality, directional asymmetry, antisymmetry and difference from the interindividual variations. The results showed no correlation between FA (either signed or absolute) and heterozygosity, body size and SMS, while heterozygosity was clearly positively correlated with body size and with SMS. Our data suggest an effect of the presence of some particular alleles on SMS, instead of an effect of the multilocus heterozygosity, even if the presence of only three polymorphic loci weakens the conclusions. Finally, no correlation was found between body size and SMS. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Honeybees must track changing distributions of food resources in their environment. We evaluated the genetic basis for interindividual differences in this ability by selecting lines of honeybees that differed in their tendency to reverse a learned discrimination between two odours. We show that individual variation in reversal learning performance, which is an analogue of natural foraging problems such as risk sensitivity, has a heritable component. Selection on drones, which are haploid, was sufficient to obtain a significant selection response after a single generation. In addition, worker age and/or task specialization, in terms of performance of housekeeping versus outside duties, is a source of environmental control over expression of reversal performance. Finally, we identified a correlated response in latent inhibition, in which pre-exposure to a conditioned stimulus (CS) retards learning about that CS when it is subsequently paired with reinforcement. From an ecological standpoint, our results suggest that colonies that contain a variety of genetic lineages may be able to target foragers to learning tasks in which they are genetically predisposed to do well.

AB The feedback hypothesis has been proposed to explain variation in nest defence intensity in birds. In species in which the female builds the nest and incubates the eggs, this hypothesis predicts a higher level of nest defence initially for females, whereas males' responses should increase when they start feeding nestlings. We studied changes in nest defence by both sexes during the nestling period in meadow pipits, Anthus pratensis. We placed a stuffed stoat, Mustela erminea, 5 m from a meadow pipit nest with nestlings aged either 2-4 or 7-12 days and recorded the nest defence behaviour of both parents for 10 min. Males came closer to the predator and mobbed more intensely for older nestlings whereas females defended the nest at a high intensity from the beginning of the nestling period. This finding agrees with the predictions of the feedback hypothesis. We also discuss possible functions of alarm calls and number of mobbing birds during nest defence.

ID PUP RECOGNITION; SEPARATION; LIONS; CUES
AB During the 4-month period of offspring dependence, northern fur seal, Callorhinus ursinus, mothers and pups use a well-developed multimodal recognition ability to routinely find one another within large and dense breeding aggregations. I studied the vocal/auditory aspect of this ability to look at operational differences between the two members of a recognition dyad. If parent-offspring conflict theory is applied to animal communication behaviour, we should expect unequal selective forces acting on parents and offspring. In northern fur seal maternal recognition dyads, I expected pups to expend more energy in the reunion process because they carry the greater burden of a failed reunion. Furthermore, in terms of signal detection theory, pups should have a lower rejection threshold (lower bias) than mothers. To address these questions, I conducted vocal playback experiments and behavioural observations on a natural population of northern fur seals in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, U.S.A. Although playback results support mutual vocal recognition, pups were both more vocally responsive and made more recognition errors (i.e. false alarms). Behavioural observations, including search time, distance travelled, signalling behaviour and contact with nonoffspring show that pups expend more effort in the reunion process. These findings are consistent with expectations and begin to quantify how selection pressure on recognition behaviour can vary at different stages of development.

AB Efficient feeding is crucial for the growth, survival and reproductive Success of most animals. In artificial-rearing environments, however, animals are deprived of many stimuli normally experienced in the wild, which may alter feeding behaviour, and thus influence their survival and reproductive success upon release in nature. In a laboratory experiment, we investigated the effect of hatchery rearing on the ability of brown trout, Salmo trutta,, to capture and consume a novel live prey item. Hatchery-reared and wild-caught trout, originating from the same river, were fed single black crickets, either in isolation or in visual and olfactory contact with another hatchery-reared or wild-caught fish. Total consumption, time to first bite and feeding efficiency were monitored. Wild-caught trout ate more, were quicker to attack, and consumed attacked prey more efficiently than hatchery-reared fish. Food consumption and efficiency increased in both wild and hatchery-reared trout during the experiment. We propose that the differences in feeding ability between wild-caught and hatchery-reared brown trout were mainly due to differences in previous experience of feeding on live prey. Wild-caught trout tended to eat more and sooner when in visual contact with another fish than when in isolation. This trend was not seen for the hatchery-reared fish, which may be due to environmental differences between the hatchery and the natural stream. The initial inability of hatchery-reared fish to forage on live prey may reduce their success when released in the wild, especially when in competition with resident wild fish.

AB For orb-web spiders, the decision to remain at a particular site or to relocate elsewhere will ultimately depend on the quality of the site. In the past, the quality of the site has been measured in terms of prey availability; spiders experiencing large numbers of prey items are less likely to relocate. However, regular web damage caused by larger nonprey animals may also contribute to the quality of a particular site. Laboratory experiments revealed that the frequency and extent of web relocation by the orb-web spider Argiope keyserlingi was influenced by the feeding regime and the rate of nonprey web damage. Daily movement patterns were influenced by web damage, and these movements were in the direction away from the source of damage. However, the cumulative distance moved during the 7 days of the experiment was influenced by the frequency with which spiders were fed. Spiders that were not given prey moved further than spiders that obtained prey. These data indicate that spiders respond to web damage on a daily basis, but the cumulative movement of spiders over a longer period is influenced mostly by the history of prey ingestion rate.

AB Previous studies suggest the physical structure of a habitat has profound effects on intraspecific competition and spacing behaviour among small mammals. We compared habitat preferences and the exploratory behaviour and aggressive territorial defence of male house mice in three types of enclosure differing only in their degree of structural complexity. Each enclosure contained a nestbox placed in one corner, a central food hopper and 10 house bricks. The bricks were either placed around the outer walls (open enclosures), lined up across the middle (wall enclosures) or scattered separately across the floor (complex enclosures). In pairwise choice tests, mice showed a strong preference for wall or complex enclosures over open enclosures but no preference between wall and complex enclosures. They were more active throughout the enclosure with complex structuring and stayed near the side walls in open enclosures. Residents in open enclosures initially showed a lower rate of attack and duration of pursuit when faced with an intruder but not when faced with a second intruder. In complex enclosures, nearly all encounters ended because the residents continued pursuit but lost track of the intruder. This occurred in only half of intruder pursuits in open and wall enclosures. Our results suggest that mice prefer areas containing physical structure because this provides a degree of protection from predators but territories with complex physical structuring appear to be much more difficult to defend. Complex areas may thus support a higher density of mice than open areas or those with more simply aligned physical structuring. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB I investigated whether scent marking has a territorial function in wild moustached tamarins. I examined the spatial distribution of scent marking within the home ranges of four groups of this neotropical primate and tested predictions from Gorman & Mills' (1984, Journal of Zoology, 202, 535-547) model for border and 'hinterland' marking. Although home ranges were economically defensible, no evidence was found for increased marking along the territorial boundary or in areas of home range overlap, but there was also no evidence for hinterland marking. Observed distributions of scent marking in exclusively used and overlapping areas of the home range did not deviate from distributions that would be expected if scent marking occurred at random (expectation based both on size of area and on frequency of quadrat occupation), and there was a strong correlation between frequency of quadrat occupation and frequency of scent marking per quadrat. These results indicate that scent marking has no territorial function in moustached tamarins. This is in line with mainly qualitative findings from the majority of other studies on wild marmosets and tamarins. These and other findings on scent marking in moustached tamarins suggest that this behaviour functions mainly in intersexual communication. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID NORWAY RATS; TRANSMISSION
AB To determine whether Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, could use socially acquired information to track recurrences of an intermittently available food (experiment 1), we allowed observer rats to interact every 2-3 days with demonstrator rats fed one of two diets, then determined the amount of each diet eaten by observers. We found that observer rats showed repeated significant increases in their preferences for foods their respective demonstrators had eaten. Because social interactions repeatedly enhanced preference for a food, we reasoned that after the socially induced food preference of an animal (A1) had waned, that preference might be reinstated in Al by interaction with a conspecific (A2) in whom Al had previously induced a preference for the food. In experiment 2, we demonstrated such social reinstatement of a food preference. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We studied female-female aggression in relation to female mate choice in black grouse, Tetrao tetrix, in central Finland, in 1994-1998. Aggression occurred on average every other minute when there was more than one female on a territory, and aggressive behaviour was most prominent when several females attended the lek. Interactions tended to be proportionally most frequent on the territories of the highest-ranking males, although not significantly so. Females that were chased by other females did not mate with lower-ranking males than their aggressors did. Furthermore, chased females were only-rarely (6% of cases) forced to move off the territory by agonistic interactions and copulations were disrupted by other females even less often (3% of cases). The choice of a mating territory did not depend on the outcome of aggression even though the aggressors were more likely to mate on the territory where aggression occurred than elsewhere. There was a marginally significant tendency for aggressors to mate earlier in the season. Females placed themselves further away from other females on the territory when soliciting a copulation than just before aggression. Our results suggest that aggression between females does not effectively constrain female choice in black grouse. Its function may be to aid females to secure undisturbed mating opportunities for themselves rather than to prevent others from mating with a particular male.

AB We report a series of experiments on social problem solving in chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. In each experiment a subordinate and a dominant individual were put into competition over two pieces of food. In all experiments dominants obtained virtually all of the foods to which they had good visual and physical access. However, subordinates were successful quite often in three situations in which they had better visual access to the food than the dominant, for example, when the food was positioned so that only the subordinate land not the dominant) could see it. In some cases, the subordinate might have been monitoring the behaviour of the dominant directly and simply avoided the food that the dominant was moving towards (which just happened to be the one it could see). In other cases, however, we ruled out this possibility by giving subordinates a small headstart and forcing them to make their choice (to go to the food that both competitors could see, or the food that only they could see) before the dominant was released into the area. Together with other recent studies, the present investigation suggests that chimpanzees know what conspecifics can and cannot see, and, furthermore, that they use this knowledge to devise effective social-cognitive strategies in naturally occurring food competition situations.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in animal aggregations may be due to variation in the presence of cues for aggregation (or disaggregation) or to variation in the receptivity of the animal to a particular cue or suite of cues. Spiny lobsters, Panulirus argus, forage solitarily but are often found aggregated in their diurnal shelters. An important proximate cause of aggregation among spiny lobsters is a scent they produce that influences shelter choice by conspecifics. We examined how variability in the presence of, or response to, such a chemical cue may contribute to diel shifts in sociality among spiny lobsters. We conducted a series of Y-maze shelter choice experiments using lobsters that were either maintained under altered dark:light schedules in the experimental arena or under natural lighting in the head tanks. Lobsters that were maintained on a light schedule 8 h later than normal chose shelters at their dawn (corresponding to the middle of the night for lobsters in the head tanks); however, their choices of shelter were not influenced by scents of conspecifics. Lobsters that were maintained on a schedule 8 h earlier than normal chose shelters in the middle of their night (corresponding to dawn for the lobsters in the head tanks). Their choices of shelter were significantly influenced by conspecific scents. These results suggest that the chemical cues for aggregation, released by spiny lobsters, are present discontinuously, that spiny lobsters are influenced by conspecific odours continuously, and that aggregation is controlled by temporal variation in the presence of a chemical cue.

AB After establishing shore crabs, Carcinus maenas, individually in separate aquaria, we used a noninvasive infrared phototransducer to monitor their heartbeat rate continously before, during and after fights with intruder crabs. We confirmed that heartbeat rate is a reliable indicator of oxygen consumption and then used it to estimate indirectly the energetic cost of fights differing in duration and intensity, and its dependence on prior residence and relative size of opponent. Prior residence in aquaria significantly increased the probability that crabs would initiate fights against intruders. The majority of fights were resolved by aggressive contacts, display being used extensively only against smaller intruders. Fights between evenly sized opponents and between residents and larger intruders involved almost continuous aggression, whereas fights with smaller intruders involved several shorter bouts of aggression. Fight duration was weakly correlated with the relative size of opponents. Heartbeat rate, measured only in residents, was elevated above resting levels throughout fights, hence energy expenditure during fighting increased linearly with fight duration. Contrary to expectation, heartbeat rate was not significantly influenced by relative size of the opponent or by the intensity of aggression. After fighting, heartbeat rate usually returned to resting levels within 30-60 min, recovery taking longer in fights against larger intruders, when the fight was always lost. We propose that prolonged elevation of heartbeat rate in residents that had lost to larger intruders represented a state df alertness, adaptive against impending risks of resource loss or injury.

AB European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, intermingle fresh herbs, especially species rich in volatile compounds, with their otherwise dry nest material. In this field study we investigated whether these herbs reduce ectoparasites and thereby protect nestlings (the nest protection hypothesis). We also considered whether volatile compounds in herbs improve the condition of nestlings (the drug hypothesis). As measures of condition we used body mass, haematocrit levels and immunological parameters. We replaced 148 natural Starling nests with artificial ones: half contained-herbs and half (controls) contained grass. The ectoparasite loads (mites, lice, fleas) in herb and control nests were indistinguishable. However, nestlings in herb nests weighed more and had higher haematocrit levels at fledging than nestlings in control nests. Fledging success was similar in herb and control nests, but more yearlings from herb nests were identified iri the colony the year after hatching. The response of:the immune system when challenged with phytohaemagglutinin did not differ in nestlings from herb and control nests. Nestlings from herb nests had-more basophils and fewer lymphocytes in their blood than those from control nests, while the eosinophil and heterophil counts did not differ. We conclude that herbs do not reduce the number of ectoparasites, but they improve the condition of nestlings, perhaps by stimulating elements of the immune system that help them to cope better with the harmful activities of ectoparasites.

AB Communication by means of visual signals occurs during the competitive, aggressive and sexual interactions of many animals. Some animals such as fish are able to change their body coloration rapidly, and there is evidence that this is used as a means of signalling. However, the precise meaning of such signals is rarely understood. We examined whether (1) darkness in juvenile Atlantic salmon is associated with submission, and (2) changing to a darker colour could act as a signal to the opponent and hence induce a change in its behaviour. We found that both the sclera of the eye and the overall body coloration tended to darken in fish that were losing territorial encounters, while victors retained their original coloration. The darkening was rapid and usually occurred during a period of sustained attacks by the opponent; however, the aggression level decreased as soon as the losing fish had become darker. We suggest that the darkening of the losing fish was associated with submission and may result in a change in the behaviour of its opponent, so minimizing the potential risk of injury during unnecessarily prolonged fights.

   EVOLUTION
AB Intracolonial conflict among ant workers can establish a reproductive hierarchy, with top-ranking individuals often securing oviposition opportunities. Here we show that in the ant Odontomachus brunneus, reproduction-based dominance interactions control worker movement and location, and that this, in turn, mechanistically governs task allocation within the colony and establishes a division of labour for nonreproductive tasks. Movement made by a worker towards the brood is mostly preceded by winning a pairwise dominance interaction, and movement away from the brood is mostly preceded by losing a pairwise interaction. Consequently, workers are distributed within the colony such that the more subordinate the individual, the more peripheral her location with respect to the reproductive centre of the nest. Behavioural roles are naturally restricted to particular zones of the colony, therefore, allocation to a particular zone, through dominance interaction, ensures role specialization. This represents a new organizational mechanism, which we call 'interaction-based task allocation'. In characterizing the dominance interactions of this species, we also identify two new behaviours: (1) 'subordinate driving', which involves a dominant individual physically manoeuvring a subordinate, by way of continued aggression, away from the reproductive centre of the nest; and (2) 'antennal shivering', which describes the antennal movements made by a subordinate immediately preceding and:during subordinate driving.

AB During metamorphosis, the nervous system of a holometabolous insect changes significantly. Attempts to demonstrate preimaginal conditioning, here taken to mean the retention of learning through metamorphosis, have given mixed results. We used two behavioural assays (the T maze and trap assay) to see whether a change in adult responsiveness could be induced by exposing Drosophila melanogaster larvae to a conditioning stimulus. There was no evidence for preimaginal conditioning from either assay, but the trap assay demonstrated that menthol contamination from the larval environment on the puparial surface could induce a change in adult behaviour. Exposure of adult insects to this contamination could give the appearance of preimaginal conditioning, when in fact the behavioural induction occurred during the adult stage. Young flies responded less strongly than older flies to the odour cues in both assays. This may explain the apparently contradictory findings of some earlier studies of preimaginal conditioning.

AB There is increasing evidence that odorants are important in the formation of attachments by the domestic chick, Gallus gallus domesticus. We investigated whether early exposure to nonaversive odorants altered the responses of 1-day-old chicks to a number of odorants from naturalistic sources, including feathers and faeces of adult chickens, wood litter and food (chick starter mash). The odorants were delivered by dynamic olfactometry, in which air containing different concentrations of each odorant was presented separately to individually housed chicks together with a small, coloured bead at which they could peck. When tested with a faecal odorant, but not the other odorants, control chicks, incubated and reared under standard conditions, shook their heads more but their pecking responses did not vary for any of the odorants tested. Chicks that had been exposed to a moist-food odorant from embryonic day 20 to 18 h posthatching and tested with odorants from either moist or dry food pecked less than controls but shook their heads the same amount. Early exposure to the moist-food odorant did not affect responses to the odorants of feathers or faeces. Chicks apparently learn about their olfactory environment during the later part of incubation and in the early posthatching period and the memory formed alters behaviour on day 1 posthatching.

AB The frequency with which blinded mottled sculpin, Cottus bairdi, oriented towards a dipole current source (50-Hz vibrating sphere) was measured as a function of source distance (2-18 cm) and azimuth (either 0 degrees in front or 90 degrees to the side of the fish). The orienting frequency declined from over 70% to under 50% as source distance increased from 4 to 12 cm for both frontal and lateral sources. When response biases (frequency of responding in the absence of the signal) were taken into account with the performance metric d', threshold distances (distances at which d' fell to 1) for frontal (12.5 cm) and lateral (11.6 cm) sources were 1.35-1.45 times the mean standard length of fish used in this study. At distances less than 8 cm, d' values were considerably higher (i.e. performance was better) for the lateral source, despite the fact that peak stimulus levels at the fish were twice as high for frontal as for lateral sources at any given distance, Performance differences may be related to differences in spatial excitation patterns, in particular the distribution of opposing pressure gradient directions along the lateral-line system, present for lateral sources, but absent for frontal sources.

AB We investigated the orientation of juvenile pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, during autumn migration in south Sweden using orientation cage experiments, to study the relative importance of visual and magnetic information at sunset. We performed cage tests under 12 experimental conditions that manipulated the geomagnetic and visual sunset cues available, for orientation: natural clear skies in the local or a vertical magnetic field; simulated total overcast in the local pr a vertical magnetic field; natural pattern of skylight polarization and directional information from stars screened off, with the sun's position as normal or shifted 120 degrees anticlockwise with mirrors; reduced polarization in the local or a vertical magnetic field; directions of polarization (e-vector) NE/SW and NW/SE, respectively, in the local or a vertical magnetic field. The pied flycatchers were significantly oriented towards slightly south of west when they could use a combination of skylight and,geomagnetic cues. The mean orientation was significantly shifted along with the deflection of the sunset position by mirrors. Reduced polarization had no significant effect on orientation either in the local, or in a vertical, magnetic field. The birds tended to orient parallel with the axis of polarization, but only when the artificial e-vector was aligned NW/SE. The mean orientation under simulated total overcast in a vertical, and in the local, magnetic field was not significantly different from random. It is difficult to rank either cue as dominant over: the other and we conclude that both visual and magnetic cues seem to be important for the birds' orientation when caught and tested during active migration.

AB Males of the cooperatively breeding stripe-backed wren, Campylorhynchus nuchalis, learn repertoires of stereotyped calls (termed WAY calls) from older male relatives. As a result, these vocalizations are normally specific to patrilineal family groups but are sometimes shared by male relatives in different groups. To determine whether or not this species can recognize the calls of different family groups, I performed playback experiments with individual call types recorded from males of known social and genealogical relationships. Subjects discriminated between the calls of unrelated neighbouring groups and unfamiliar groups, and they discriminated both of these from calls of their own groups. However, subjects failed to distinguish calls of males in other groups from calls of their own groups when these males were members of the same patriline. These results indicate that stripe-backed wrens can discriminate between repertoires of these calls that match or differ from their own. Consequently, they can recognize members of their patriline, not just members of their immediate group. These vocalizations probably provide a useful mechanism for recognizing group membership in this species and might also provide a mechanism for recognizing unfamiliar relatives in other groups.

AB During nursing, the young of many ungulates butt at their ams' udder, which has been hypothesized to reflect difficulty obtaining milk. We investigated the effect of manipulating milk flow rate on the butting behaviour of domestic calves sucking milk from an artificial teat. The lowest rate of butting during nutritive sucking occurred with the fastest flow rate, and the highest rate of butting occurred with the slowest flow rate. When milk flow rate was changed during a meal, calves butted more following a decrease in flow rate than following an increase in flow rate. Butting rates were consistent and relatively low with a constant flow of milk. Regardless of flow rate, calves butted more at the beginning of their meal compared with the middle and end. Overall, the highest butting rate occurred when milk flow stopped, either at the end of the meal or when milk flow during the meal was stopped repeatedly for 30-s periods. We conclude that calves are sensitive to variations in milk flow rate and that butting rate changes accordingly. The occurrence of butting by young ungulates during nursing thus may indicate either a stoppage of milk flow or a decrease in milk flow rate, and thus may help identify periods of nonnutritive sucking during nursing.

AB In this experimental study, the postnuptial moult in the pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, was studied in relation to the timing of the breeding cycle. By exchanging clutches with different laying dates, I either delayed or advanced the breeding cycle. At fledging time, the majority of delayed females started moulting while still feeding the nestlings, while advanced females only rarely did so. The moult of delayed females had also progressed further than that of females in control and advanced groups, respectively. The moult of males had usually progressed further than that of females, but when it started in relation to the breeding cycle did not differ between the study groups. These results suggest that female pied flycatchers have a more fixed timetable for reproduction and moult than males do. The start of moult in females seemed to depend on their original breeding cycle, while the males initiated their moult when the foster brood reached a certain age. A change in the incubation period for females did not affect the hatching success of eggs, but delayed breeding, and extensive moult-breeding overlap imposed fitness costs in terms of fewer fledged young, both absolutely and in relation to clutch size. These findings suggest sexual differences in the mechanisms controlling allocation of resources to reproductive and somatic investments, respectively.

AB In two. experiments on appetitive learning we conditioned lambs, Ovis aries, to particular concentrations of a flavour by mixing the flavour with an energy-rich food that complemented their energy-poor diet. The lambs were subsequently offered energy-rich food with five different concentrations of the flavour (the concentration to which they were conditioned, two higher concentrations, and two lower concentrations). At these tests, the lambs consistently preferred the weaker flavours. This finding stands in contrast to earlier results on generalization gradients. In a third experiment, similarly designed to the other two, we tested for effects of a strong flavour on the behaviour of lambs when they were offered a novel nutritious food. Half of the lambs were offered unadulterated wheat, and the others strongly flavoured wheat. We found that the flavour in itself was initially aversive. We propose that the lambs' avoidance of foods with strong flavours may be an expression of a rule of thumb of the type 'given a choice, avoid food with strong flavours'. Such a rule could be part of a risk-averse foraging strategy displayed by mammalian herbivores, and which could be of particular importance when they encounter unfamiliar foods.

AB In animal and plant taxa where parents deposit an oversupply of eggs/neonates into a spatially restricted 'nursery', intense sibling competition commonly results. An inversion of Hamilton's rule identifies the theoretical lower limit for how an individual in a sexual species ought to favour its own welfare over that of its close kin in such an ecological squeeze. A broad array of behavioural and life-history phenotypes appears to have evolved, at least in part, for dealing with close kin as serious competitors. We have recently summarized the theory and empirical data addressing both sibling competition and parent-offspring conflict (Mock &; Parker 1997, The Evolution of Sibling Rivalry), and here present a precis that aims both to give a quirk overview of that fuller treatment while allowing us to update the book's literature review with a few late-breaking findings.

AB Direct homing refers to the behaviour whereby an ant with food runs in an almost straight line to the nest. We determined whether non-polarized light acts as a directional cue in the direct homing behaviour of the grass ant, Tetramorium caespitum. We carried out tests (1) under a blue sky or in total overcast conditions in the field, and (2) with a view of the sun or with a non-polarized light within a box in the laboratory. The ants' paths were recorded, and then analysed by means of circular and linear statistics. Ant workers with food were able to home directly under a blue sky, under totally overcast skies, and even under non-polarized lighting. In a fifth test we displaced the ants at the beginning of the homing trip; they returned to the presumed nest location along a path that ran parallel to the true homing vector, as if they had not been displaced. The results suggest that the ants home by dead reckoning, that is, they can measure directional changes and distances travelled during the outward trip, and integrate them into a mean home vector for direct homing depending on an external light-based reference system, that is, either the polarized skylight pattern or non-polarized lighting.

AB Behavioural observations and DNA fingerprinting were used to determine the relationship between male and female behaviours and levels of extra-pair paternity in the wheatear, Oenanthe oenanthe. Behavioural observations were consistent with the hypothesis that males attempted to ensure paternity by mate guarding, while pursuing extra-pair copulations (EPCs) primarily outside the fertile period of their pair female. The intensity of guarding varied with time of season and was greater at late nests. However, although males on territories with late nests also experienced high intrusion rates, the intensity of guarding was influenced more by the operational sex ratio (which was female skewed at early nests) than by intrusion rates per se. We suggest that early breeding males adopted a strategy of territorial defence to ensure paternity, as opposed to guarding their female directly (which late breeding males did), to capitalize on the increased opportunities to pursue EPCs in neighbouring territories. Females were less conspicuous than males in their pursuit of EPCs, were never seen off territory or observed to solicit extra-pair males directly, and rejected the majority of EPCs. The frequency of extra-pair paternity was 11% of 73 offspring, in 29% of 17 broods, and was not correlated with the intensity of guarding. Female cooperation appeared to be important for successful copulation, and extra-pair paternity is therefore likely to be a consequence of solicited, or at least accepted, EPCs. We discuss why females might have participated in EPCs. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB We examined sexual selection on male body size in a laboratory population of the seed beetle, Stator limbatus, and the fitness consequences to females of mating with larger males. Large males produced larger ejaculates than small males. Both males and females lost body weight as a consequence of breeding, and large males lost more weight than small males. The amount of weight lost by males correlated as highly with female fecundity as did the amount of weight lost by females. Similarly, male and female body weight correlated equally highly with female fecundity. These results indicate that males make substantial contributions to female fecundity, probably through nutrients transferred in their ejaculate. As a consequence, fecundity selection should favour large body size in both males and females. We found no preference for large males when virgin females were presented with only one male, but when presented with two males simultaneously, females were more likely to mate with the larger male. This result is consistent with relative female choice or male-male competition, although no indications of male-male competition were observed. Females that mated with small males re-mated sooner than females that first mated with large males. Females that first mated with a non-virgin male were also more likely to re-mate than females that first mated with a virgin male, suggesting that females re-mate to obtain additional sperm or nutrients and not just as a form of mate choice. In addition to the possible benefits from mate choice and male-male competition, large males gain a mating advantage through reduced sperm competition. This large male advantage, combined with fecundity selection on males as well as females, may account for males being larger than females in this species.

AB We released juvenile Anolis aeneus lizards into vacant patches of habitat in the field and observed as they established territories. Individuals settling in the presence of few competitors obtained more exclusive home ranges than did individuals settling at higher densities. When settling at high densities, juveniles that eventually attained high social status fought and chased their opponents more frequently than did juveniles that were subordinate to other residents at the end of the settlement period. With respect to predicting an individual's final status and space use, however, the fact that it fought other settlers was more important than the outcome of those fights. Results from this and previous studies in this series are consistent with a general model of territory establishment that includes assumptions about the value of familiar space, the costs of aggressive interactions and the ability of settlers to form predictable social relationships with one another.

AB We tested the hypothesis that red colobus monkeys, Piocolobus badius, and Diana monkeys, Celcopithecus diana, in Tai National Park, Ivory Coast, associate to increase safety from predation. We recorded stratum use, exposure and vigilance of each species in the presence and in the absence of the partner species. in the presence of Diana monkeys, red colobus used lower strata more often, were more exposed to the forest floor and looked down less often while foraging. This suggests that red colobus reduce predation pressure from ground predators by associating with Diana. There are several indications that both species are less vulnerable to birds of prey when associated: red colobus looked sideways less often and were more exposed to the front, Diana monkeys used greater heights and were more exposed to the front, to the rear and from above. We also asked whether specific sentinel qualities of Diana monkeys might explain why other sympatric monkey species additionally seek their presence. When groups of various species compositions were approached by an observer, or confronted with an eagle model, Diana monkeys raised the alarm in most cases. Since neither monkey species improves its foraging success when associated, this study shows that predation can both maintain and be the ultimate cause of interspecific associations.

AB Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are considered the primary defence mechanism in aposematic ithomiine butterflies and arctiid moths. Despite evidence that pyrrolizidine alkaloids are effective against some invertebrate predators, proof for a protective function of pyrrolizidine alkaloids against vertebrate predators is fragmented. The present work shows that the pyrrolizidine alkaloid monocrotaline is unpalatable to the pileated finch, Coryphospingus pileatus, and that the unpalatability is learned through association with a specific colour pattern (blue stripes). In a series of trials, using mealworms as model prey, birds rejected those to which pyrrolizidine alkaloid solution had been applied topically but accepted prey devoid of the alkaloid. Subsequent offerings of prey with pyrrolizidine alkaloid and a painted blue-striped pattern led to consistent rejections by the experimental birds. Birds were then offered blue-striped painted larvae without pyrrolizidine alkaloids ('mimics'), which were rejected at levels similar to the previous trial. The predators learned to recognize the prey as unpalatable items based on their experience in the previous encounters. These results provide evidence for the protective capacity of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid against a vertebrate predator and supports the role of these chemicals in aposematism in the Lepidoptera.

AB In the grey partridge, Perdix perdix, vigilance and calling activity are two sex-dimorphic behaviours that are critical for mate choice. To ascertain whether circulating levels of testosterone directly affect vigilance (i.e. the occurrence of upright alert posture), we compared vigilance scores of testosterone-implanted versus control males both during the normal activity of the flock and after the passage of a raptor silhouette; in the latter case, the calling activity was also recorded. Hormone-treated males were more vigilant than controls in both experimental situations. Vigilance was correlated with calling rate. Testosterone seems to act as a link, relating conspicuous behaviours involved in sexual selection to male quality and physical condition, because of the costs of having high levels of both signalling and androgens.

ID INFANTICIDE; BEHAVIOR
AB Alloparental care was investigated in the biparental West African cichlid, Pelvicachromis pulcher. Non-breeding adults typically consumed young conspecifics but this trait was inhibited in both sexes during reproductive attempts. Alien conspecific young were accepted into the brood if they were of a similar age/developmental stage to the parents' own young but not if they were much older or much younger. If not accepted they were consumed by whichever adult located them. Parents separated from their brood for up to 4 days accepted their young on reunion but separation for more than 4 days resulted in the young being consumed. This latter response occurred if chemical stimuli from the young were available during the separation but not if visual stimuli were available. In this latter case parental responsiveness was maintained. Both sexes of this externally fertilizing species appeared to have the same information about their young and showed the same changes in responsiveness and the same discriminatory abilities.

AB Clark's nutcrackers, Nucifraga columbiana, rely upon cached seeds for both winter survival and breeding. Laboratory studies have confirmed that nutcrackers use spatial memory to recover their caches. In the laboratory, however, nutcrackers seem to perform less accurately than they do in nature. Two lines of evidence indicate that nutcrackers make 'errors' in the laboratory that are not due to failures of memory. First, when digging in sand-filled cups, nutcrackers were 89% accurate when they plunged their bills directly into the middle of cups but only 21% accurate when they swept their bills across the cups. Second, nutcrackers were more accurate when the cost of probing was increased by covering sand-filled cups with either petri dishes or heavy glass bowls. Birds recovered caches in order of increasing costs. As costs increased, nutcrackers made somewhat fewer errors nearer to cache sites before recovering the caches and dramatically fewer errors further away from cache sites or near cache sites after recovering the caches. Some errors may be a form of environmental sampling. We conclude that the impressive achievements documented by previous studies are underestimates of the spatial memory abilities of Clark's nutcrackers.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID MALES; BEHAVIOR; SIGNALS
AB Males of the picture-winged flies Drosophila silvestris is and D. heteroneura produce a sound during courtship wing vibration; successful courtships include more time spent in wing vibration. We clipped male wings to test whether this sound is a necessary signal for the success of male courtship. We tested females in no-choice tests and also in choice tests in which each female was provided with a clipped and normal male simultaneously. We found no differences in the probability of copulation for either species in no-choice tests, and no difference for the choice tests with D. heteroneura. Surprisingly, clipped males were significantly more successful than control males in the choice tests with D. silvestris. The latencies to copulate did not differ by treatment in any tests. Consequently, the sound produced by courtship wing vibration does not influence male mating success and thus does not meet the most important criterion for being a sexual signal. We propose that the vibration of thoracic muscles, transmitted through the substrate or through the male's forelegs, could provide a sexual signal in these species.

   BENEFITS; COSTS
AB Some bird species may breed close to aggressive predators to reduce predation risk by more dangerous, generalist predators. We tested this protective nesting association hypothesis by studying solitary choughs, Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax, breeding within or outside lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni, colonies in northern Spain (1993-1994). We found 27 potential predators of choughs and kestrels and confirmed predation on adults and nests of both species by at least eight common predators. We experimentally assessed the defence investment of choughs and kestrels towards a stuffed eagle owl, Bubo bubo, in 19 buildings shared by both species. Lesser kestrels were more efficient at detecting the predator, and defended more vigorously than choughs. Choughs clearly selected for breeding buildings where lesser kestrel colonies were installed. Breeding success of these choughs was much higher than that of choughs breeding alone, because of a lower percentage of nest failure. Benefits to choughs probably accrued from both the 'parasitism' of the kestrels' nest defence and the dilution of predation risk in the colonies. Since lesser kestrels do not prey on choughs, this could be a good example of protective nesting association in birds. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID RUNNING SPEED; DISTANCE; BEHAVIOR; MARMOT; COVER; FISH
AB How close should an animal allow a potential predator to approach before fleeing to a refuge? Fleeing too soon wastes time and energy that could be spent on other important activities, but fleeing too late is potentially lethal. A model to predict flight initiation distance was developed, based on the assumption that animals would flee at a distance that allows them to reach the refuge ahead of the predator by some margin of safety. This model predicts that (1) flight initiation distance should increase with distance from the refuge (which has been supported by studies on several species) and (2) the rate of increase of flight initiation distance with distance from a refuge should be higher when the refuge is between the predator and prey (prey runs towards the predator) than when the prey is between the predator and the refuge (prey runs away from the predator). Prediction 2 was tested by approaching juvenile woodchucks, Marmota monax, along an imaginary line between the animal and its burrow entrance and measuring the distance between the observer and the animal at the moment it started its flight. As predicted, the rate of increase in flight initiation distance was higher when the burrow was between the observer and the woodchuck than when the woodchuck was between the observer and the burrow. The slopes were appropriate for predators with pursuit speeds about twice the escape speed of the woodchucks. The difference between the slopes was 1.78 m flight distance/m distance to refuge, close to the value of 2 m flight distance/m distance to refuge predicted by the model. The intercept indicated that woodchucks allowed a margin of safety of about 7.6 m. The model permits quantitative evaluation of the principal elements of flexible escape decisions of animals and provides a measure of how predation risk increases the cost of space use in relation to distance from a refuge.

AB The influence of consexual social stimulation on the regulation of body mass in female European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, during reproductive development was examined. Twenty-four pairs of birds were housed in three social stimulation treatments: (1) control, where birds were housed in visual isolation from their partner; (2) visual contact, pairs of birds were separated by a clear Perspex screen, preventing direct physical contact, but allowing birds to view each other; (3) complete contact, pairs of birds were housed with no intervening divider, allowing full interactions between birds. The influence of these treatments on gonadal development, body mass and energetic reserves was examined. The manipulation did not significantly influence degree or rate of gonadal development, but did influence total body mass; birds from the complete contact group increased body mass to a greater extent than the other groups. This between-group difference was attributable to changes in lean mass, rather than energetic reserves. However, within the complete contact group, subdominants increased their energetic reserves more than dominants. These results are, in part, consistent with differences in competition for food between the treatment groups influencing mass regulation, although changes in activity levels may also be important. Unlike previous studies, these results suggest that the social environment may influence the regulation of lean mass in addition to energetic reserves.

AB A field experiment conducted on 49 young termite colonies lends support to the hypothesis that ecological constraints on successful offspring production favour two-parent care. Colonies cared for by two parents were twice as likely to survive the six-month experiment as were colonies headed by single parents. Among surviving colonies, the percentage change in the number of offspring did not differ between colonies headed by two parents versus single parents. Workers (third instar juveniles and older), but not non-workers (first and second instar juveniles), were found in all surviving colonies, indicating that offspring survivorship, not new offspring production, accounts for difference in success of two parents and single parents. Three of the four surviving single-parent colonies became two-parent colonies by the end of the experimental period: in two colonies, offspring became replacement reproductives; in the third colony, an adult male re-paired with a nest-founding female. Conspecific pressures from new nest-founding adults that flew onto logs containing the experimental colonies may account for high mortality in all colony types. New nest-founding pairs settled near experimental colonies. The mean numbers of new nest-founding pairs per experimental-colony area were significantly positively correlated with the proportion of single-parent colony failures in that area.

   SYSTEMS; ECOLOGY
AB Ground squirrels (genus Spermophilus) display considerable interspecific variation in male reproductive behaviour. Although male Arctic ground squirrels, S. parryii plesius, are territorial during the mating period, males in several other species of Spermophilus are not. To begin exploring the reasons for this behavioural difference, patterns of mating behaviour and sperm precedence were characterized for a free-living population of S. parryii plesius. Twenty females that were monitored continuously throughout behavioural oestrus consorted and presumably copulated with a mean of 1.9 +/- 0.8 males during a single period of sexual receptivity. A combination of electrophoretic and DNA fingerprinting analyses revealed that more than 90% of pups in litters (N = 11) reared by females that consorted with two or more males were sired by a female's first mate. The percentage of young sired by each of a female's consorts did not vary with either consortship duration or the interval between consortships by different males. Instead, the only consistent correlate of paternity was consortship order. Both pre-consortship calling and post-consortship defence of females were significantly associated with first consortships, suggesting that males were able to distinguish unmated females from females that had already copulated. Because the probability of siring young should influence which females are preferred as mates and how males compete for access to those females, comparative studies of sperm precedence patterns may yield insights into the evolution of interspecific variation in male mating behaviour.

Upon encounter, males and females engage in a pre-mating struggle. The two components of female mating behaviour were the rate of evasive behaviours displayed, termed the index of female resistance, and struggle duration. The behaviour patterns of individuals of each sex changes depending on their previous experience. Females held at the high male density performed fewer resistance behaviours during struggles and struggled longer than did females held at the low male density. Female mating frequency was positively related to male density. A measure of male behaviour (male insistence) was derived from a regression of struggle duration on the index of female resistance. Males held at the high male density had greater insistence than those held at the low male density. Female density had no effect on male insistence. Male mating frequency was not related to male or female density. Overall, male and female body length were related to neither behaviour pattern nor mating frequency, although mated males were significantly longer than unmated males at low male density. The results are consistent with the view that mating frequency depends on female resistance, which varies in response to the costs of struggling that depend upon previous male harassment. Male mating behaviour changed with male density. Males harass both males and females, but females generally stay at the edge or out of the water when males are present. Since encounter rate is consistently low, males assess their probability of mating via their encounter rate with other males. A high male density leads males to increase their effort when they do encounter a female. Female mating behaviour was not related to male phenotype, suggesting that female choice is not present in A. remigis. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB While foraging, many animals alternate between feeding and scanning. Spectral analyses of sequences of successive scan and inter-scan durations suggest the existence of a significant non-random, periodic component in the scanning dynamics of some birds. Evidence for cyclic vigilance remains controversial, however. Here data obtained from a purple sandpiper, Calidris maritima, two Barbary doves, Streptopelia risoria, and two choughs, Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax were re-analysed by making use of statistical methods from non-linear dynamics. Predictability portraits obtained by subjecting the data to non-linear forecasting support the view that the vigilant behaviour of the two choughs is periodic with superimposed noise. By contrast, the hypothesis of periodic scanning is rejected for the sandpiper and doves, as well as that of pure randomness. Instead, the vigilant behaviour of the sandpiper and doves bears the signature of deterministic chaos: high, short-term, decaying predictability of scan and inter-scan durations. The sequential structure of the data sets makes them well suited for reliable computation of the rate at which predictability declines; results support the conclusion of chaotic patterns. Finally, a mathematical model is developed to investigate some possible functional benefits of periodicity and chaos in vigilant behaviour, compared with random scanning, in terms of the optimization of corporate vigilance of birds foraging in flocks. If individual vigilance is chaotic, then even loose coordination, based on predictions only one foraging bout ahead, can dramatically reduce individual predictability and enhance the level of group surveillance.

AB The mean inter-pulse interval of the song of male Drosophila melanogaster is a courtship signal which shows relatively little variability in natural populations and is important to male mating success. Artificial selection was carried out on this trait for six generations, producing a line of flies that had a mean inter-pulse interval outside the normal range for the species. The stock used was derived from isofemale lines taken from a natural population in which other studies had suggested heritability for this trait was low. The response to selection was asymmetric, with a greater response for longer inter-pulse interval. Analysis of other changes between the lines suggests that the genes selected for act fairly specifically on inter-pulse interval, reducing both the mean inter-pulse interval and the number of pulses produced. Analysis of F-2 and back-cross generations suggested a polygenic additive architecture without a significant non-additive component or disproportionate role of sex-linked genes on mean inter-pulse interval. Contrary to expectations, variance was greater in the F-1 than in F-2 or back-cross generations, and the realized heritability was much greater than the evolvability (coefficient of additive genetic variation). The results suggest that behavioural traits with low variability still retain the potential for rapid evolution, perhaps because environmental sources of variation counteract fixation.

AB The popular assumption that mammals possess cognitive mapping abilities, that is that they are able to organize mentally a kind of global-view-from-above puzzle made of subsets of landmarks that are locally perceptible from given ground-level places, has never been demonstrated. Water maze experiments were designed to test this assumption in rats, Rattus norvegicus, Although they were given ample opportunity to build a cognitive map during the preceding training trials, the rats proved unable to navigate accurately towards a hidden goal, an escape platform, during the tests in which they were given no opportunities to use any other orientation mechanism. Although such results may not constitute definite proof against cognitive mapping in rats, they question its existence. In previous experiments purporting to show cognitive mapping, the animals may have used simpler orientation mechanisms. The results of this study suggest that, at least, the a priori assumption that mammals are capable of cognitive mapping should be abandoned. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The early social development of spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, is marked by a dramatic transition at 2-3 weeks of age, when infants are taken from the isolation of their natal den, where they are intensely aggressive, to the communal den, where they meet most dan members for the first time. This study examined behaviour patterns in eight sets of captive twins during the first month of life to document the changes that prepare young hyaenas for social integration at the communal den. Bite shakes, the most extreme aggressive behaviour, declined markedly within the first week of life, but other forms of aggression remained constant. During week 1, low-intensity prosocial behaviour occurred primarily between mother and cub. By week 2, higher-intensity social play emerged, occurring mainly between siblings. In weeks 3 and 4, cub interactive play was most frequent, lasted longer and was more vigorous. Locomotor and object play did not emerge until weeks 3 and 4, respectively. Dominance relations between siblings were operationally defined by submissive withdrawals. Accordingly, aggression was unidirectional, with dominants initiating most interactions. By contrast, play was reciprocal and equally initiated by dominant and subordinate cubs. Maternal interruption of cub behaviour mainly occurred during extreme aggressive interactions, but rarely during vigorous play. Results showed that prosocial behaviour emerged in captive hyaena cubs following a decline in severe aggression and before the time wild cubs are taken from the natal to the communal den. It is suggested that play may modulate aggression, following the establishment of a dominance relationship, and may serve an immediate prosocial function to prepare aggressive infant hyaenas for integration into the clan.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUND PRODUCTION; MATE CHOICE; ATTRACTION; PYRALIDAE; LEPIDOPTERA
AB Pair formation in the lesser wax moth, Achroia grisella, is facilitated by male ultrasonic signals and female phonotaxis towards those signals. The signals are generated by the action of a pair of tymbals located on the tegulae and consist of pairs of approximately 100-mu s pulses of 70-130 kHz sound. A brief (<400 mu s) silent interval normally separates the two pulses in a pair, and 100-120 pairs of pulses are produced per second.
   Playback experiments using edited male signals showed that females preferentially oriented towards calls that were louder, delivered with higher rates and more evenly spaced pairs of pulses, and included longer pulse lengths and longer silent intervals within pairs of pulses. Preferred rates, lengths and silent intervals were greater than mean values in the male population, indicating the potential for directional selection and female choice. Preferences for pulse amplitude, rate and length were based on acoustic energy and power of the male signals, whereas the preference for long silent intervals was not. Female evaluation of pulse length and asynchrony interval shows that the insects can distinguish signal events as brief as 150 mu s.
   Achroia grisella females do not continue to increase their response levels as rates are elevated beyond 142 pairs of pulses per second, which may reflect a neural constraint. Similarly, the preference for long silent intervals may reflect a mechanical constraint in which the tympanum responds less strongly to pairs of pulses separated by short intervals, thereby reducing the probability that an action potential is evoked.

   model for behaviour

LA English

ID FRESH-WATER SNAIL; PHYSA
AB Adaptive gender expression in simultaneous hermaphrodites will reflect the relative costs and benefits of each sexual function. The net gain through either or both functions may vary with body size. Shell length measurements of Physa gyrina and P. heterostropha in the laboratory and P. heterostropha in the field revealed that successful mating generally involved smaller sperm donors and larger recipients. In contrast, attempts by larger snails to donate sperm were contested by smaller snails. These data suggest substantial plasticity in gender expression in accordance with a game-theoretic extension of Ghiselin's (1969, . Rev. Biol., 44, 189-208, 1974; The Economy of Nature and the Evolution of Sex) size-advantage model. Specifically, the larger of two interacting snails is more fecund, so the smaller snail has more to gain by donating sperm. This asymmetry creates a contest in which the smaller snail can afford to escalate the contest more and still profit, so long as escalation costs are not greater for the smaller snail. In the present study, the usual form of contest escalation was a visually obvious shell-swinging display, which attracts predators. Thus, the smaller of two contestants can use the risk of predation as a weapon in Contest escalations (i.e. a game of chicken), rather than using a purely physical contest that might favour the larger contestant.

AB Electric organ discharges (EODs) from African mormyrid weakly electric fish can be species-, sex- and individual-specific. In this study, small EOD differences were used to track the day-to-day movements of individuals from two species of Brienomyrus in their natural stream habitat in West Africa. Waveforms were digitized and 15 measurements were taken of amplitude, time and spectral characteristics. For quantitative comparisons, the measurements were transformed by principal components analysis. By matching similar EODs from one day to the next, best guesses were made as to the daily movement patterns of individuals. Sexually mature males, females and juveniles all tended to return to the same daytime hiding place on successive days (median movement of 1 m).

ID ORGANIZATION; BIRDSONG
AB The relation between genes and canary song learning preferences was analysed with two experiments. A breeding experiment used inbred canaries, Serinus canaria, reared in isolation from adult songs to uncover differences in the song learning of Roller canaries, Border canaries and their hybrid. Given a choice of a Roller and a Border canary tutor song, all Rollers selectively learned from the Roller song, all Borders learned only from the Border song, but the hybrids learned from both tutor songs. A pair of social experiments confirmed these strain-typical learning preferences in conditions permitting social interaction and some cross-fostering. Cross-fostering showed that early experience with an alien-strain female parent does not noticeably affect the development of canary song learning preferences, and that neither strain is totally incapable of hearing and learning from songs of the other strain. The study provides empirical evidence for canary epigenetic rules, which are postulated gene-inherited mechanisms that guide cultural transmission. Some epigenetic rules for canary song learning are described. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Three nesting behaviour patterns are documented in the plethodontid salamander Hemidactylium scutatum. A female may lay eggs (1) in a solitary nest and brood them, (2) in a joint nest and brood them as well as eggs of other females, or (3) in a joint nest that is brooded by another female. The hypothesis that population density was positively associated with joint nesting was tested by following two populations for 5 years and by experimentally manipulating the population density of nesting females in artificial habitats for the latter 2 years. The proportion of joint nests did not vary with density, although joint nests tended to contain eggs of more females at the high population density. Joint nests were usually brooded by one female; thus, most females that laid eggs in joint nests did not brood them at high density. The reproductive success, as measured by survival of embryos, of solitary and joint nesters was equivalent. Joint nests were deserted less often, however, which decreased the probability of catastrophic mortality. The number of days of brooding was significantly positively correlated with loss of body mass of females, suggesting a cost to brooding behaviour. Joint nesting with solitary brooding is not explained by aggressive usurpation of nests or by brood parasitism. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Sexual imprinting occurs in two stages, an acquisition phase when the birds learn about their social environment, and a consolidation process where the acquired information is linked to sexual behaviour and stabilized. Some of the factors that may influence acquisition and consolidation, respectively, were examined. Zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, males were reared by Bengalese finch, Lonchura striata, foster parents until 40 days of age, then isolated for 60 days, and exposed to a zebra finch female for Ih at day 100. Thereafter, the birds were isolated for 3 days and then exposed to a Bengalese finch female for another 1 h. In subsequent preference tests, the preference scores of the birds were correlated with how much they were fed by their foster parents. The influence of the first exposure to a zebra finch female correlated positively with the level of arousal of the experimental males, as indicated by measurements of displacement activities and corticosterone levels. When first exposed to a female as adults, the experimental males could learn features of a potential sexual partner and, simultaneously, the acquired preference was consolidated. Consolidation, however, was independent of the appearance of the female: after having a 24-h access to a nestbox on day 99, the experimental males developed an exclusive preference for Bengalese finches. These results confirm that acquisition and consolidation are different processes which can be separated at least by the appropriate experimental design.

AB Social spiders build communal nests and capture webs, share food, and care for offspring communally. They do not have distinct castes, nor is there clear evidence for reproductive division of labour. This study examines the possibility of division of labour occurring in non-reproductive tasks in colonies of the social spider Achaearanea wau (Theridiidae). Observations of marked individuals and of activities in colonies over the entire life cycle demonstrate that (1) there is no clear division of labour among adult females and (2) juveniles add tasks to their repertoire of activities as they mature. The lack of a clear separation of tasks by different individuals in a colony raises the question: what constrains the evolution of division of labour in social spiders? Constraints associated with inbreeding and selection favouring rapid colony growth through individual reproduction may explain the lack of both reproductive and non-reproductive division of labour.

AB Patterns of sex ratios and sex investment ratios pray an instrumental role in theoretical and empirical considerations of the evolution and maintenance of insect sociality. An assumption of sex-ratio studies in the eusocial Hymenoptera is that workers, who reproduce indirectly by rearing the queen's offspring, have the ability to distinguish the sex of larvae and direct preferential treatment towards developing females. To determine if workers of the monogyne (single queen per colony) form of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, have this ability and the extent to which they might use it to influence the sex ratio of the colony's reproductives, the primary sex ratio (ratio of male/female-determined eggs produced by the queen) and the secondary sex ratio (ratio of male/female reproductive adults or pupae) were compared, in mature colonies producing sexuals of almost exclusively one sex or the other, a common condition in monogyne colonies of this and other ant species. Queens of male-producing colonies laid about 19% haploid (male) eggs, whereas queens of female-producing colonies laid about 11% haploid eggs. In both cases, the proportion of haploid eggs laid was far higher than the proportion of adult males reared by the workers. These results suggest that workers strongly influence the colony's secondary sex ratio by selective elimination of male larvae, but the magnitude of this influence depends upon the primary sex ratio produced by the queen. Highly male-biased secondary sex ratios produced by workers in relation to more male-biased primary sex ratios may be caused by ergonomic constraints that could limit the ability of workers to skew the sex-investment ratio.

AB Sexual and social behaviour in male birds is largely controlled by gonadal secretions, most notably testosterone. In this paper the relationships between natural testosterone plasma concentrations and mate guarding, singing and rates of aggression in male barn swallows are reported. Behaviour of individually marked male swallows was observed in three breeding colonies. Individual mate-guarding rate was positively correlated with individual testosterone plasma level adjusted for stage in the breeding cycle in which blood was sampled. Mean mate-guarding rates by males at different stages in the breeding cycle were also positively correlated with mean testosterone levels in the population. Individual singing and fighting rates did not show a significant correlation with testosterone but mean singing rate in the population was positively correlated with mean testosterone levels. Male tail length, which is a morphological trait currently under directional sexual selection, was inversely correlated with mate-guarding rates after controlling statistically for the effects of testosterone.

AB Three capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella, were tested on object-choice tasks in which the correct (i.e. baited) object was indicated by the experimenter during the response period on half of all trials. Three cue conditions were used in five experiments: gazing at the correct object, gazing plus pointing, and pointing alone. The subjects did not use the experimenter's gazing at the correct object as a cue. In contrast, they did use gazing plus pointing, and the final experiment showed that pointing was necessary and sufficient under the conditions of the study. The ineffectiveness of the experimenter's gazing as a cue may be caused by reduced cue-response spatial contiguity, but it may also reflect a limitation of mental or visual perspective-taking in these monkeys.

TI HUMAN SCENT MATCHING USING SPECIALLY TRAINED DOGS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this project was to provide data on the success rate of dogs identifying people by scent when working in conditions similar to those used by the police in Holland and Germany. Over 700 scent samples were collected from people of both sexes and a wide age range and seven dogs, Canis familiaris, were trained to match human body scents. The test conditions were carefully controlled to eliminate any cue other than the body scents presented to the dog. Each dog sniffed a piece of cloth which had been in contact with an unspecified part of the body of a person and then indicated which of a selection of blank or body-scented cloths bore the same scent. The handler did not know the location of the target scent. The average score of the dogs working with body-scented cloths from six donors was 80% correct whereas a random choice of cloth would have been 17% correct. A further experiment was carried out in which three dogs were asked to match odour from various parts of the body with hand odour of the same donor collected on clean steel tubes. The average score for this task was 85% correct with a selection of six donor odours. The results show that dogs have considerable scent matching ability but that individual aptitude and the day-to-day performance can vary. Dogs used in criminal investigations should be selected for aptitude and the tests replicated so that conclusions are not based on trials from a single dog.

AB An investigation was conducted to determine whether the spatial predictability of food affects the ability of groups of juvenile convict cichlids, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, to achieve an ideal free distribution (IFD). Groups of six fish competed for Daphnia magna prey in one of three environments differing in the degree to which food was predictable in space. Prey were distributed among four patches, each defined by its probability of receiving the prey (0.667, 0.167, 0.083 and 0.083). Spatial predictability was manipulated by varying how often these probabilities were re-assigned to the patches over six trials. In the Predictable treatment, patch probabilities remained the same throughout the six trials. In the Intermediate treatment, probabilities were re-assigned to the patches prior to each of the six trials. In the Unpredictable treatment, probabilities were re-assigned to the patches six times within each trial. Thus, groups of fish experienced either one, six or 36 spatial configurations of the patch probabilities in the Predictable, Intermediate and Unpredictable treatments, respectively. The distributions of fish and their patterns of resource use were compared with those predicted by the IFD, ideal despotic, and the IFD with perceptual constraints models of habitat selection. In the Predictable treatment, the distribution of fish was qualitatively consistent with the predictions of the ideal despotic distribution. Dominant fish were the most successful foragers, spending more of their time and obtaining more of their food in the best patch than subordinates. In the Unpredictable treatment, both dominant and subordinate fish under-used the best patch, suggesting they were unable to track its location. However, dominant fish had higher foraging rates than subordinates, probably because they were better at detecting and capturing prey. The distribution of fish in the Intermediate treatment was closest to an IFD, despite differences between fish in competitive ability. These results suggest that the predictive power of the IFD is influenced by the spatial predictability of the environment.

AB Relationships between dominance rank, copulatory behaviour and reproductive success within a single mating season were examined in 13 male reindeer, Rangifer tarandus, in a semi-free-ranging population. A linear dominance hierarchy existed only among the top six ranking males. The top-ranking male monopolized access to oestrous females. Frequency of copulation and estimates of reproductive success increased significantly with increasing dominance rank. Reproductive success estimated from the frequency of copulation did not differ from that predicted by a priority of access model but it was less than expected for the top three ranking males and the other males were more successful than expected. Mate choice by females and pair interference by males would have skewed reproductive success in favour of higher ranking males. On the other hand, chasing activity and vocal display indicated that male mating efforts were costly. With these behavioural costs and reduced forage intake, high-ranking males eventually became exhausted. The ratio of actual to expected reproductive success of the top-ranking male decreased from 0.98 (11-17 October) to 0.57 (18-24 October). Consequently, mating opportunities for the low-ranking males increased during the second half of the mating season.

TI INTERGROUP TRANSFER IN ASSATEAGUE PONY MARES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Between-group transfer of adult female ponies, Equus caballus, was investigated for three consecutive summers on Assateague Island, Maryland, U.S.A. Both the inter-band movements of individual mares and the mare turnover rates of one-male ''harem'' bands were examined. Long-term transfers occurred at rates ranging from 0.06 to 0.18 per mare per month. Mares with foals transferred more frequently with mares without foals, but neither female age, pregnancy, nearest-neighbour distances nor  dominance rank affected the likelihood of transferrring. Band turnover rates were uncorrelated with the average frequency of mare-mare aggression within the band, but new mares entering a band suffered a transient riase in aggression received. Thus, female aggression did not encourage, and may have discouraged, inter-band transfers. Older stallions and stallions who had held bands for 2 years or more had significantly larger and more stable bands. Fewer mare turnovers were seen in bands whose stallions tended to face their mare, showed a relatively high proportion of time feeding, and showed a relatively low proportion of time involved in aggression with other stallions, although at marginal levels of significance for all three variables. Thus, variability in stallion attributes, and possibly behaviour, probably plays the strongest role in determining mare transfer patterns at Assateague.

TI MALE MALE COMPETITION AND FEMALE CHOICE IN THE CORTEZ DAMSELFISH,
   STEGASTES-RECTIFRAENUM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male-male competition and female mate choice were investigated in a field population of the Cortez damselfish, Stegastes rectifraenum. Theoretical considerations suggest that female choice should be important when: female mobility is high; breeding is not restricted to a brief, explosive period; and females are capable of rejecting mates despite persistent male mating efforts. Stegastes rectifraenum clearly meets all of these criteria. Focal observations indicated that male body size was significantly positively correlated with male reproductive success, whereas behavioural traits, such as aggressiveness and courtship vigour, were not. An experiment in which successful males were removed from their territories and recolonization monitored indicated that males compete for high-quality territories. In a second experiment, standardizing the quality of male nest sites caused the relationship between male body size and reproductive success to disappear. Contrary to expectations  based on current theoretical developments, these results suggest that the single most important correlation with male reproductive success (body size) is produced indirectly by female choice of nest-site quality in combination with male-male competition for high-quality territories.

TI SEQUENTIAL HERMAPHRODITISM AND THE SIZE-ADVANTAGE HYPOTHESIS - AN
   EXPERIMENTAL TEST
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When members of one sex have a low reproductive success when small and a high reproductive success when large, while members of the opposite sex do relatively better when small and relatively worse when lare, sequential hermaphroditism is commonly believed to be favoured by natural selection. This so-called-size-advantage hypothesis has not been rigorously tested experimentally. For the hermaphrodite Ophryotrocha puerilis puerilis, a polychaete, in which small individuals are males and large  ones females, the hypothesis predicts that reproductive success will increase less with body size for males than for females, eventually promoting sex change in males. Dry body weight of males was not correlated with reproductive rate, whereas there was a positive correlations for females in reproducing pairs. Furthermore, an increment in the size of females affected clutch size and reproductive rate more than did an equal increment in the size of males. Reproductive success of males decreased with size, because females preferred smaller males. At the same time, large males won contests for access to females, although female choice overrode this combat superiority. Therefore, after reaching a certain size a male would not benefit from staying male. Taking into account the relatively low cost of sex change in this species (about 5 days being lost, equivalent to one interbrood interval) sex reversal occurred as predicted by the size-advantage hypothesis.

TI ALLOPARENTAL BEHAVIOR IN BARBARY MACAQUES, MACACA-SYLVANUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Over 300 h of local-animal samples of mothers and non-mother females in a semi-free ranging group of Barbary macaques showed that individuals of all age-sex categories display affiliative alloparental behaviour toward infants. Macaques vary in the amount of infant-non-mother interactions, and Barbary macaques are at the extreme interactive end of this continuum. The most reasonable explanation for this pattern in Barbary macaques is that it promotes infant socialization and aids others in  establishing and maintaining social contacts with the infant, or with other troop members.

TI COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE EGG-DUMPING ALTERNATIVE IN GARGAPHIA LACE BUGS
   (HEMIPTERA, TINGIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Females of the subsocial lace bug, Gargaphia solani, frequently lay eggs in the egg masses of conspecifics. While guarding their own eggs from predators, egg recipients inadvertently protect the eggs of egg dumpers. Egg recipients were compared with egg dumpers in terms of fitness components including adult survivorship, fecundity and the survivorship of offspring. Females that left at least some eggs with conspecifics suffered greater egg mortality but had higher total fecundity and avoided predation more successfully than egg recipients. By using the egg protection afforded by recipients and thus avoiding maternal risks and long periods of care, dumpers are free to lay as many eggs as physiologically possible, and to be more fecund early in life. The egg-dumping alternative effectively circumvents the ecological costs and maternal behaviour, conveying a powerful advantage to dumpers that is not shared by egg recipients.

TI BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES TO PREDATORS AND PREDATION RISK IN 4 SPECIES OF
   LARVAL ANURANS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Tadpoles of four anuran species show interspecific behavioural differences that could explain differential prediation on these species in artificial ponds. Replicated observations of tadpoles in aquaria revealed that the spring peeper, Hyla crucifer, is quiescent and benthic; Fowler''s toad, Bufo woodhousei, is active and benthic; the grey treefrog, Hyla versicolor, is active and pelagic; and the Pine Barrens tree frog, Hyla andersonii, is intermediate in activity and microhabitat  position. Species with high activity levels survived poorly in independent artificial pond predation studies, relative to less active species. Costs of low activity levels may include poor competitive ability, and/or slow development with increased risk of death from pond dying. Comparisons of tadpole behaviour in aquaria with and without predators present demonstrate that all four species decrease activity with a salamander, the red-spotted newt, Notophthalmus viridescens, and a fish, the  black-banded sunfish, Enneacanthus obesus. Hyla andersonii became more benthic with these predators. Hyla versicolor and H. andersonii decreased conspicuous activities in response to a dragonfly naiad, Pantala. Bufo woodhousei responded to E. obesus even though B. woodhousei tadpoles are unpalatable to fish. Inactive H. crucifer responded less to predators than other species but survived well with predators. Baseline prey activity levels (observed in the absence of predators)  may be more important than shifts in activity levels in response to predators in determining differential predation.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB A study of conoly genetic structure in a putative eusocial sphecid wasp was undertaken to clarify the social status of this species. High female nestmate relatedness and simple colony genotype distributions suggest that colonies may often comprise matrifilial monogynous families. These families are multi-generational groups in which reproduction is evidently limited to a single mother ''queen''. A population-level analysis of successful reproductive females indicates the existence of a size-structured reproductive division of labour in the study populations, supporting the claim that this wasp exhibits fully eusocial behaviour.

TI DYNAMICS OF TASK SWITCHING IN HARVESTER ANTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, were marked when engaged in one of four activities outside the nest: foraging, patrolling, nest maintenance and upkeep of the colony refuse pile. In undisturbed older colonies, each activity was done by a distinct group of workers. In undisturbed younger colonies, nest maintenance workers were likely to forage. Further experiments examined the conditions under which workers of each task group engaged in other activities. Marked workers were observed in the course of perturbations that increased the numbers engaged in one activity. In response to perturbations, most workers switch tasks to forage, and nest maintenance workers were likely to switch to other tasks. Previous work showed that changes in the numbers of ants engaged in one activity alter the numbers engaged in other activities. The experiments with marked individuals described here show that task switching among exterior workers does not account for the observed responses to perturbations. This means that within a time scale of several hours, one worker group receives information about events affecting other worker groups.

TI RESPONSE TO SELECTION FOR EARLY AND LATE DEVELOPMENT OF SEXUAL MATURITY
   IN DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Selection for early and late development of sexual maturity (switch-on) in Drosophila melanogaster was successful. There was greater response for late than for early maturity. Furthermore, only females showed a response for early development of sexual maturity, whereas both sexes responded to selection for late developed of sexual maturity. Four correlated responses appeared consistently across replicates: flies selected for late development of sexual maturity were slower to mate as mature flies, slower to mate a second time, had lower fecundity, and had shorter egg-to-adult development time. The selection response is consistent with the interpretation of past natural selection for rapid development of sexual maturity, particularly in males. The coordinated response of sexual maturity, mating speed and fecundity suggests the involvement of juvenile hormone in the selection response.

TI THE ETHOLOGICAL BASIS OF MATE CHOICE IN MALE THREESPINE STICKLEBACKS,
   GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male threespine sticklebacks presented with pairs of dummy females differing in abdominal distension or body size usually courted the more distended or larger one first. This tendency increased with the disparity between dummies, even when distension or size were exaggerated well beyond normal limits. When projection area was pitted against volume males preferred the dummy with greater projection area over the one with greater volume. Moreover, males courted in proportion to the projection area  of the dummies, even though clutch size was better predicted by volume than by projection area of gravid females. Larger or more distended dummies were also more effective in eliciting courtship than smaller or less distended dummies when the dummies were presented successively. Design features of the perceptual mechanism(s) may lead males to prefer larger, more distended females. This would pre-adapt male sticklebacks to select more fecund or receptive females in nature when they have a  choice, although under certain conditions it may lead them to behave suboptimally.

TI LONG-TERM-MEMORY AND RECOGNITION OF ANOTHER SPECIES IN THE PARADISE FISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The habituation of exploration of a goldfish, Carassius auratus, but a paradise fish, Macropodus opercularis, was examined. A first encounter of at least 1 min was necessary for habituation to be found in a second encounter 3 h later. When the paradise fish were allowed 5 min to explore the goldfish and the second encounters were staged between 3 h and 3 months later, persistent habituation was found. The relation between memories formed during encounters with other species and modelling of  the environment by the paradise fish is discussed.

TI POST-COPULATORY GUARDING STRATEGIES IN THE NON-TERRITORIAL DRAGONFLY
   SYMPETRUM-SANGUINEUM (MULLER) (ODONATA, LIBELLULIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Reproductive behaviour, particularly mate-guarding strategies, of male Sympetrum sanguineum (Muller) was studied at Quy Poors Fen, Cambridgeshire [(UK] during 1984 and 1985. Two mate-guarding strategies used by males were identified. All pairs started oviposition while in the tandem or contact-guarded formation; some pairs remained in tandem for the whole oviposition bout (termed ''tandem only'' pairs), while the remainder separated before completion of the bout and the male continued to guard by a non-contact strategy (''non-contact'' pairs). The switch in male guarding behaviour was related to the amount of interference from other males experienced during the early stages of tandem oviposition. Pairs employing the non-contact strategy had longer oviposition bouts than pairs using the tandem only strategy, but did not differ in the total number of egg-laying dips. Female dip rate was higher during the tandem than the non-contact phase of an oviposition bout. Females flick their abdomen while flying to aid egg release, and faster dip rates result in an increase in egg release rate. It is suggested that ovipositing females and tandem pairs are much more vulnerable to predation by larger odonates than lone males are, and therefore that male S. sanguineum adaptively switch between guarding strategies to balance the risk of losing their female to a rival male with the energetic and survival costs associated with tandem flight.

TI INDIVIDUAL ODORS AND MATE RECOGNITION IN THE PRAIRIE VOLE,
   MICROTUS-OCHROGASTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A habituation-discrimination technique was used to demonstrate that male and female prairie voles can discriminate individual differences in the odours of soiled shavings and urine from male and female consepcificis. A second experiment, employing a Y-maze, showed that females significantly preferred the odours of their mate over those of either another mated male or an unmated male. Males preferred their mate''s odours to those of other mated females but showed no significant preference between the odours of their mate and those of a virgin female. A third experiment demonstrated that, over a 10-h period, females built nests and/or stayed preferentially on the side of a Y-maze containing their mate''s odours. Likewise, males preferentially built nests in their mate''s side compared to the side containing odours from a virgin female. However, although the same trend was present when mate odours were paired with odours from another mated female, the preference was not  statistically significant. Taken as a whole, these results indicate that mate recognition may be an important function of individually distinctive odours in this species.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The development and dynamics of responses to naturally occurring odours in spiny mice, Acomys cahirinus, were assessed in a series of experiments using a multi-choice test apparatus. The animals were tested every fifth day from day 1 of age until 35 days. The tests were carried out using both a longitudinal and a cross-sectional design. No differences were found between the experimental designs. Young A. cahirinus pups (1-10 days old) showed a strong preference for a familiar home cage  odour. This preference declined as the pups grew, and by the 25th day of life the pups were no longer attracted by the familiar odour. From 20 days of age, they began to show an increasing preference for an unfamiliar odour from unrelated conspecific adults. There were no significant differences in the responses of males and female to odours. The biological importance of responses to odours during the development of pups, and the multi-choice testing method, are discussed.

TI INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP EFFECTS ON EARLY CAREGIVER INFANT RELATIONSHIPS IN
   RED-BELLIED TAMARIN MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The relationship between changes in caregiver-caregiver and caregiver-infant behaviour was studied during the infants'' first month in 10 faimly groups of red-bellied tamarins. Sarguinus labiatus, with twin infants. With infants of a given age, father generally spent a higher proportion of time carrying per infant than did mothers, but in most cases these differences were not significant. Mothers and fathers carried significantly more than older siblings did at the beginning and end of the infants'' first month. With older infants, caregiver started to rub off infants they were carrying, so that infants started to spend some time off all caregivers. Each caregiver initiated carrying by retrieving and infant from another caregiver, and sometimes retained and infant against a retrieve attempt by another caregiver in order to continue carrying it. Before infants started to spend some time off, time spent carrying by mothers, fathers and older siblings was positively correlated with the percentage of retrieve attempts by other caregivers that they retained against, and, more strongly, with the values of their own number of retains minus the number of retains by other caregivers against them. These results indicate that competition to care for infants has a direct effect on the early development of each caregiver-infant relationship within the family group.

TI MOTHER OFFSPRING CONFLICT IN VERVET MONKEYS - VARIATION IN RESPONSE TO
   ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mother-offspring conflict in vervet monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops, was studied in three different environments: a dry woodland habitat, a swamp habitat and captivity. Based on the rate at which mothers rejected their infants, and on the relative roles of mother and infant in maintaining contact, it was possible to rank the three environments in terms of the level of behavioural conflict between mother and offspring. The highest level of conflict occurred between mother-infant pairs in the swamp habitat which had higher quality food than the dry woodland habitat. The lowest level of conflict was observed in captivity. This ranking suggests that for vervet monkeys, the level of mother-offspring conflict is responsive to difference in the environment and can be explained by an interaction between food quality and interbirth interval.

TI SHIFTED MAGNETIC-FIELDS LEAD TO DEFLECTED AND AXIAL ORIENTATION OF
   MIGRATING ROBINS, ERITHACUS-RUBECULA, AT SUNSET
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The migratory orientation of the robin was tested in shifted magnetic fields during the twilight period after sunset, under clear skies and under simulated total overcast. The horizontal direction of the geomagnetic field was shifted 90.degree. to the right or left in relation to the local magnetic field, without changing either the intensity of the field or its angle of inclination. Experiments were conducted during both spring and autumn, with robins captured as passage migrants at the Falsterbo and Ottenby bird observatories in southern Sweden as test subjects. Generally, the orientation of robins was affected by magnetic shifts compared to controls tested in the natural geomagnetic field. Autumn birds from the two capture sites differed in their responses, probably because of different migratory dispositions and body conditions. The robins most often changed their orientation to maintain their typical axis of migration relative to the shifted magnetic fields. However, preferred  directions in relation to the shifted magnetic fields were frequently reverse from normal, or axial rather than unimodal. These results disagree with suggested mechanisms for orientation by visual sunset cues and with the proposed basis of magnetic orientation. They do, however, demonstrate that the geomagnetic field is involved in the sunset orientation of robins, probably in combination with additional visual or non-visual cues that contribute to establish magnetic polarity.

TI A MIRROR-IMAGE AMBIGUITY IN HONEY BEE PATTERN-MATCHING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Honey bees, Apis mellifera, preferred a figure that was a mirror image of a familiar, food-associated pattern over a novel pattern. This behaviour does not involve a complete ambiguity in the recognition/visual matching system, but rather a facultative ambiguity, since bees clearly prefer the fimiliar pattern over its mirror image when offered a choice. Bees did not show a similar preference for a figure that differed from a food-associated pattern because of a 90.degree. rotation or because it was an up-down reversal of the training pattern. There are some interesting analogies with the ability of human infants and other animals to distinguish shapes.

   QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF FEMALE SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female mice living in a high density enclosed population of 77-90 mice were classified into five social classes on the basis of their breeding status and spatial range. Activity, frequencies of interactions with males and with females, agonistic scores against males and against females and non-social behaviour were measured over a short period for each of 63 adults living together in the population. Multivariate discriminant function analysis discriminated four of the five female classes (P < 0.0001) on the basis of interaction frequencies and agonistic scores, especially against other females, and the derived functions classified 94% of females into their correct pre-defined class. Territorial males were descriminated from non-territorial males (P < 0.0001) by their greater activity, interaction frequencies and agonistic scores against other males, and the derived function classified 96% of males into their correct pre-defined class. Analysis of males and females together discriminated all classes except non-breeding females that had very restricted spatial ranges versus non-territorial males. Variation in reproductive success among individual females was related both to their social class and variation in the quality of their nest sites, and provides an explanation for the stability of high density mouse populations provided with excess food. Non-breeding females with access to the highest quality resources underwent few interactions with other mice; advantages  for delaying reproduction in response to social cues which signal poor breeding conditions are discussed.

TI SOCIAL AND SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR OF MALE AND FEMALE ZEBRA FINCHES TREATED WITH
   ESTRADIOL DURING THE NESTLING PERIOD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Zebra finches, Poephila guttata, were injected daily for the first 2 weeks after hatching with oestradiol benzoate (OB) or the control vehicle. After reaching adulthood, all birds were gonadectomized, implanted with testosterone propionate, tested, then implanted with OB and tested again. Copulatory behaviour was demasculinized (decreased in males) by the early OB treatment, supporting earlier suggestions that sex hormones influence the development of copulation in birds in an opposite manner to that in mammals. Beak chattering and carrying nest material were also demasculinized, but several other male-typical behaviour patterns such as singing and nest soliciting were masculinized (increased in females). The simultaneous occurrence of both masculinization and demasculinization in the same species as a result of the same early hormone treatment has not been observed previously. Females given early OB were more likely than controls to try to pair with other females rather than with males. Thus the sex hormone environment during the nestling period is an important determinant of adult social and sexual behaviour, including pairing preference, in this monogamous, colonial songbird.

AB Hormonal bases of chromatic and behavioural changes in female Holbrookia propinqua were studied. Bright orange and yellow pigmentation were induced by progesterone or testosterone. Oestrogen treatment induced significant deposition only of the organic pigment, which did not attain full brightness. Progesterone and testosterone induced agonistic behaviour by females towards males: oestrogen did not. However, frequency of aggression was lower for females treated simultaneously with oestrogen and progesterone. Induction of bright reproductive coloration and activation of agonistic responses towards males by the same hormones suggests a close correlation between the signal value of the colour pattern and female aggression towards males.

TI FOOD-INTAKE RATE AND RESOURCE AVAILABILITY - FLOCKING DECISIONS IN HOUSE
   SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Several models have attempted to show that variation in the size of foraging groups is a function of the individual forager''s net benefit. These models assume that the individual''s rate of food intake is an appropriate approximation of this ''net benefit''. In this paper, these ideas are examined experimentally by presenting house sparrows, Passer domesticus, with two feeders of different food availabilities. The food intake rates of sparrows foraging at the large feeder increased with flock size, but at the small feeder it decreased with flock size. These data were used to predict the settlement patterns of sparrows foraging at either two large or two small feeders: sparrows should forage alone when the food intake rate decreases with flock size, but should join the flock when food intake rate increases with flock size. The settlement patterns of the sparrows indicate that they generally preferred to join the flock, rather than forage alone, even when this reduced their food intake rate. These results suggest that food intake rate alone is not an adequate measure of the costs and benefits of foraging in groups.

TI VARIATION IN HOST PLANT-QUALITY - INFLUENCES ON THE MATING SYSTEM OF A
   DESERT GRASSHOPPER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous field work on the grasshopper Ligurotettix coquilletti revealed that females were not evenly distributed among male mating territories, Larrea tridentata (creosote) bushes, but were clustered at particular locations. These sites generally harboured several signalling males simultaneously and also possessed foliage preferred by the insects as a food source, this preference being based on the relative absence of various extra-foliar compounds. The clustering of females, therefore, could result from a preference for specific bushes because of the resources (i.e. food) available there and/or an orientation to groups of males per se. Here, a field experiment designed to test the former alternative is described. For this experiment 24 bushes with known histories of prior occupancy were selected and epigamic effects (i.e. male signalling) were equalized among the bushes over a 7-week period by maintaining one singing male per bush. Monitoring the distributions of both naturally occurring and released females showed that female settlement during the experiment resembled that seen under natural conditons, i.e. females still accumulated on those bushes with histories of high occupancy. When females whose chemosensory organs had been removed were released in the study plot, however, settlement occurred indiscriminately. It is concluded that, while female orientation to groups of males may occur, variability among bushes in their foliar chemistry alone appears sufficient  to promote a skewed distribution of females.

TI THE ROLE OF PREY AVAILABILITY IN AGGREGATIVE BEHAVIOR OF THE ORB WEAVING
   SPIDER TETRAGNATHA-ELONGATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Like many spider species, Tetragnatha elongata exhibits considerable flexibility in its spacing pattern as a response to variable levels of pregy abundance. This study examines the extent and form of spider aggregation at high prey density. In experiments in which their respective densities were manipulated, when spider density was high, excess prey allowed individuals (1) a significant reduction in web building, and (2) indiscriminate use of pre-laid silk. These effects were not observed at low spider density. These results are discussed in the contex of ''risk-sensitive'' foraging theory, which shows this type of behaviour in an aggregation might be adopted as a means for reducing resource variance. Such an approach indicates a possible means through which sociality might be initiated.

TI GROUP-LEVEL DYNAMICS IN HARVESTER ANTS - YOUNG COLONIES AND THE ROLE OF
   PATROLLING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The flexibility of colony organization in the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, was investigated in the field in older (about 5 years) and younger (about 2 years) colonies. Perturbations affecting nest maintenance work, foraging and patrolling were made singly and in various combinations. In both younger and older colonies, events that directly affected only one activity caused changes in the numbers of ants engaged in other activities. An increase in patrolling early in the activity period caused foraging to decrease later on. Combined perturbations show that in both younger and older colonies, all three activities were linked by complex, synergistic interactios: the response to a perturbation affecting one activity itself varied, depending on the states of the other activities. The results suggest a more strongly homeostatic response to perturbations in older colonies than in younger ones: older colonies appeared to respond more consistently to single perturbation, and to decrease foraging less in combined perturbations, than did younger ones. Individual workers live only about a year. Thus similarities and differences in the flexibilities of colonies 3 or more years apart are organizational rather than a result of the accumulated experience of particular individuals. Ontogenetic changes in a colony''s response to environmental stress may be ecologically important.

TI COPULATION BEHAVIOR IN THE GOSHAWK, ACCIPITER-GENTILIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The copulation behaviour of 15 pairs of goshawk, Accipiter gentilis, was studied by V. Holstein during 960 h of observation. Copulation activity was seasonally bimodal, with peaks in the early nesting cycle and immediately before and during egg laying. Copulations were most frequent in the early morning around the time of egg laying and to a smaller degree in the late afternoon. Males copulated more frequently than usual after returning from a hunt. They spent most time near their mates  immediately before and during egg laying and were near their mates most of the early morning before and during egg laying, but not during the incubation period. The males delivered prey to the females primarily during a morning and an afternoon peak. The morning peak was markedly later in the pre-incubation than in the incubation period. An interspecific comparison, between diurnal birds of prey, of copulation frequency in relation to the extent of male provisioning during the pre-laying and  the egg-laying period showed a strong positive correlation. Colonial species had higher copulation rates than comparable solitarily breeding raptor species. Copulation behaviour and mate guarding in the goshawk seem to have evolved primarily in response to sperm competition.

TI BEHAVIOR OF THE SUSPECTED LIZARD COMPETITORS ANOLIS-SAGREI AND ANOLIS
   CAROLINENSIS - AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST FOR BEHAVIORAL INTERFERENCE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Intra- and interspecific encounters were staged in the laboratory using adult brown anoles Anolis sagrei, and green anoles Anolis carolinensis, two species believed to be in competition in southern Florida. Agonistic behaviour of resident males toward heterospecifics was much less intense than that of resident males toward conspecifics. This suggests that behavioural interference between males is unlikely to be an important component of competition between these species. In staged encounters between males and females, courtship behaviour was usually observed only in conspecific encounters, and copulation was observed exclusively in conspecific encounters. This suggests that copulation between these species is uncommon under natural conditions.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The responses of free-swimming Daphnia magna to the presence of suspended food particles was studied using a novel video system which enables the visualization and reconstruction of swimming tracks in three dimensions. In high food concentrations the Daphnia reduced their exursions in a vertical direction, and straightened their tracks. A purely visual stimulus mimicking the light distribution in food-rich waters was not capable of evoking the track straightening response, but did reduce vertical excursions. These findings are related to the observed distribution of algal particles in natural habitats.

TI INFLUENCE OF THE ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FROG
   RANIDELLA-RIPARIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB At its southern edge the distribution of the frog Ranidella riparia abuts, with only a narrow zone of overlap, that of its allopatric sibling species R. signifera. In previous reports there was no evidence for any reduced survival of R. riparia in the creeks occupied by R. signifera immediately adjacent to the edge of its distribution. Here we examine the hypothesis that the acoustic environment in those creeks might inhibit successful communication by R. riparia. Although the  structural characteristics of the R. riparia call were less suitable than those of R. signifera for transmission through the heavily vegetated habitat characteristic of those creeks, this alone did not inhibit successful reproduction by R. riparia. At a distance of 25 cm the average intensity of a call from an R. riparia male was 24 dB lower than one from R. signifera. In addition R. signifera form a continuous chorus in which the minimum sound intensity always exceeds that of single R. riparia calls at 25 cm. We propose that R. riparia cannot colonize creeks adjacent to their present distribution because the loud noise from R. signifera choruses either suppresses their calling activity, or makes them inaudible to potentially receptive females.

TI MALE AGE - EFFECT ON MATING-BEHAVIOR AND SUCCESS IN THE COCKROACH
   DIPLOPTERA-PUNCTATA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Older cockroach, Diploptera punctata, males (28 days old) transferred more sperm and larger spermatophores to females than 8- or 14-day-old males. In one male: one female behavioural tests, no significant correlations were found between either how rapidly males initiated courtship with females (response time), or intensity or duration of courtship, and the number of sperm or size of spermatophore subsequently transferred. Eight-day males were slower to initiate courtship than 28-day males.  There was no significant difference in the duration of courtship for 8-, 14- and 28-day males, even though the mean duration of courtship was more than twice as long for 8-day males compared with 14- and 28-day males. In competitive mating tests with one female and three males, one of each age, 28-day males were significantly more successful than 8- and 14-day males. It is concluded that the greater success of 28-day males is due to differences in male behaviour rather than to female discrimination.

TI SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS OF PIGLETS IN A SEMINATURAL ENVIRONMENT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The social relationships of domestic piglets (Sus scrofa) kept with adult and juvenile pigs in a large outside enclosure were examined. Focal and scan sampling techniques were used to collect data on five measures of social behaviour: resting, social facilitation, nearest neighbours, butting and sniffing. Cluster analysis indicated that, between birth and 13 weeks of age, piglets had stronger social relationships with littermates than with non-littermates, their dam, other adults or juveniles  but social preferences were not found between particular pairs of littermates. Litters were born in separate farrowing nests but non-littermates came into contact within 15 days of birth. Fostering occurred when two piglets switched dams spontaneously, and these piglets subsequently exhibited stronger relationships with their foster than with their natural littermates. Results are discussed with reference to intensive housing systems and evolutionary pressures.

Seeds were provided at randomly chosen sites in the afternoon and the numbers of greenfinches at these bait sites in the afternoon and the following morning were compared. Numbers did not increase from the afternoon to the morning in eight out of nine trials where greenfinches  turned up at the bait sites. Attraction to the bait decreased with increasing ambient temperatures, more birds turning up during severe frost. Subordinate females were attracted to the bait more frequently than dominant male greenfinches.

TI SPATIAL-LEARNING AND DISCRIMINATION OF FOOD PATCHES IN THE EUROPEAN
   BADGER (MELES-MELES L)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Theories of foraging often assume that concentrations of prey (''patches'') can be discriminated by a forager, but there have been few studies of how this is achieved when patches are not recognizable by means of an obvious proximal cue. We observed the search trajectories of two badgers (Meles meles L.) foraging for peanuts in artificial patches to see how efficiently they could map a new patch in the first place, and whether they would remember the location and extent of a previously visited  patch. The results suggest that when a patch is encountered for the fist time, a strategy of area-restricted searching keeps the animal''s trajectory largely witin the patch boundary. After a single exposure to a novel patch, however, badgers show evidence of being able to remember its location and extent, apparently with reference to distal landmarks.

TI KIN RECOGNITION AND VIRGIN QUEEN ACCEPTANCE BY WORKER HONEY-BEES
   (APIS-MELLIFERA L)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Virgin honey bee queens provide genetic cues that can be used by workers to assess genetic relationships. We found that groups of caged workers, taken directly from colonies containing a functional queen and two patrilineal subfamilies, could distinguish among queens of different degrees of kinship. The first virgin queen that an individual worker encountered was assessed by that worker on the basis of her kinship similarity to the individual interacting worker or her similarity to the caged group. When a second virgin queen was introduced, she was assessed by workers based on her similarity to the first virgin queen. The outcome of the ensuing fight to the death among the two introduced queens was dependent upon their relationship to each other. The resident queen had a strong advantage when the virgin queens were from different subfamilies but the outcome was nearly even when they were patrilineal sisters.

TI DO HONEYBEES GET TIRED - THE EFFECT OF LOAD WEIGHT ON PATCH DEPARTURE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Tiny extra weights (brass nuts) were placed or removed from the thorax of ''nectar''-collecting workers of the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) while they foraged for sugar solution in a patch of artificial flowers. The weights could be added singly, so as to increase the rate at which weight was gained during nectar-collecting independently of crop volume. Extra weights could also be removed so as to keep the bee at a more or less constant total weight while collecting more and more nectar. I  investigated whether departure for the hive, before a full crop is obtained (as repeatedly reported in the literature) is due to the effect of an increasing weight of the load. The results did not suggest straightforward effects of an increasing load weight (or crop volume). Rather, it is likely that bees take into account their cumulative metabolic expenditures while exploiting the patch, in the present case irrespective of the temporal pattern of carrying extra loads.

TI AGE SPECIFICITY OF EGG DUMPING IN GARGAPHIA-SOLANI (HEMIPTERA, TINGIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB This study tests two hypotheses concerning the unusual oviposition behaviour of the lace bug. Gargaphia solani. In this species, females facultatively place their egg masses of conspecifics and thus avoid the costs associated with subsequent maternal care. Since the costs of maternal behaviour are positively correlated with female reproductive value, it was of interest to test whether ''egg dumping'' is a function of reproductive value, and whether egg dumpers discriminate between egg recipients with high and low reproductive values. The results of age-specific observations and oviposition choice tests demonstrate that females with high productive value act as egg dumpers significantly more frequently than females with low reproductive value, but that egg dumpers do not discriminate between egg recipients of different ages, leaving eggs with the first susceptible female encountered.

TI MALE SPAWNING SUCCESS AND FEMALE CHOICE IN THE MOTTLED TRIPLEFIN,
   FORSTERYGION-VARIUM (PISCES, TRIPTERYGIIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A detailed analysis was made of the variation in spawning success among male Forsterygion (.tbd. Tripterygion) varium. The aim was to assess whether famles were mating selectively and, if so, to examine the basis of that choice. Eggs were laid on small rocks within the males'' territories. Females did not distribute eggs randomly among males. Some males guarded as many as 23,000 eggs in one breeding season, while others experienced little or no breeding success. Male spawning success was positively correlated with both their size and some characteristics of their territories, namely the amount of spawning substratum and the presence of a large boulder adjacent to the territory. Experimental manipulations indicated that female choice of males was based on these features. Addition of small rocks into the territories of previously unsuccessful males resulted in a significant increase in spawning success. Conversely, spawning success of the most successful males decreased when  small rocks were removed from their territories. When successful males were removed, each territory was occupied by small males; however, there was no significant change in the spawning success of these males. This experiment suggested that, although territory quality was important, female mating decisions could also be influenced by male characteristics such as body size.

TI SIMILARITY OF PLAYBACK SONGS TO SELF SONG AS A DETERMINANT OF RESPONSE
   STRENGTH IN SONG SPARROWS (MELOSPIZA-MELODIA)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) were presented with a series of four playback songs of decreasing similarity to their own song. Strength of territorial response was inversely correlated with similarity of the stimulus song to the subjects'' own songs. The males discriminated between the songs of strangers within their own population, based on whether the stranger''s song was of the same ''cadence type'' as a song in the subject male''s repertoire. Habituation to self song is not considered  an adequate explanation for the observed results. Instead, an active recognition of similarity to self song is postulated, the function of which is not clear. To the degree that self song has a unique salience to the males, song sparrows can be said to have an auditory concept of ''self''.

TI THE ONTOGENY OF LOCOMOTOR PLAY-BEHAVIOR IN THE DOMESTIC CAT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A descriptive account is given of the development of locomotor play in the domestic cat (Felis catus) under laboratory conditions. The subjects were 7 families, each family consisting of a mother and her 2 kittens and living in its own indoor pen. Each family was separately presented with a multi-level climbing frame for 30 min once every 3 days, between 36 and 60 days after birth (9 presentations in total). Kittens spent a substantial proportion of the observation session climbing, sitting standing and walking on the frame, especially after 48 days of age. Kittens sometimes lost balance and fell off the frame, particularly when performing more difficult motor acts. Standing and walking on the upper levels of the frame were first seen at 48 days of age and increased in incidence thereafter. Mothers sometimes climbed on the frame and there was an overall positive association between mothers'' and kittens'' use of the frame. There were large and consistent behavioral differences between families. The climbing frame provides a potentially useful tool for assessing the development of certain locomotor skills under conditions where the subject''s behavior is spontaneous.

TI BEHAVIORAL EVOLUTION AND DOMESTIC DEGENERATION IN OBLIGATORY
   SLAVE-MAKING ANTS (HYMENOPTERA, FORMICIDAE, LEPTOTHORACINI)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The foraging and nest emigration abilities of the obligatory slave-making ants, Harpagoxenus canadensis, H. sublaevis and H. americanus were examined in laboratory experiments involving both natural and slave-deprived colonies. The slave-makers contributed relatively little to these domestic tasks when slaves were present, but their apparent abilities expanded to varying degrees in the absence of slaves. H. canadensis appeared to be the most self-sufficient of the three species and displayed a suprisingly full repertoire of foraging and emigration behaviour, including the ability to recruit nestmates by ''tandem running'' in both contexts. The relative degree of domestic degeneration in these species was correlated with the extent of their behavioural specialization for conduction slave-raids. These results reinforce current views regarding the evolution of slavery among leptothoracine ants.

TI RELATIONS BETWEEN GROUP-SIZE AND COMPOSITION AND FEEDING COMPETITION IN
   MOUNTAIN GORILLA GROUPS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The intensity and patterning of interference competition for food within mountain gorilla (P. g. beringei) social groups is influenced in several ways by group size and composition and varies within and across age/sex classes. Data on 251 spatial displacements associated with feeding, collected during a 17-mo. study of mountain gorilla feeding ecology, show that overall displacement rates and displacement rates for individuals were positively correlated with social group size. Silverback males were responsible for a disproportionately high number of displacements. Adult females also were involved in competitive interactions over food more often than expected from their representation in groups, and had feeding bouts interrupted disproportionately often, principally by other females and by silverbacks. Competitive relationships between females varied in association with female dominance rank and age, but were not clearly associated with relatedness between females. The results support the argument that social foraging entails a cost which is proportional to group size and which falls particularly on adult females. The comparatively low rates of competitive interactions suggest that this cost is relatively low, and that female mountain gorillas sacrifice little in terms of feeding efficiency by living in social groups.

TI THE SENSITIZATION OF YOUNG WORKERS TO QUEENS IN THE ANT MYRMICA-RUBRA L
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of workers born into a queen-containing society upon their subsequent brood rearing behavior, was tested in the polygynous ant M. rubra L., using small summer and large overwintered larvae. Workers, reared from the point of emergence in the presence of queens, had more control over larval growth compared with workers reared without queens. The current presence of queens had little influence. A critical period exists when young workers become sensitized and perhaps imprinted by the presence of queens. The character of the workers, size of the colony and the queen/worker ratio influence the degree of worker response towards queens and are discussed.

TI RHESUS-MONKEY (MACACA-MULATTA) SCREAMS - REPRESENTATIONAL SIGNALING IN
   THE RECRUITMENT OF AGONISTIC AID
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Free-ranging rhesus monkeys on Cayo Cantiago (Puerto Rico) give 5 acoustically distinct scream vocalizations during agonistic encounters. These calls are considered an important mechanism in the recruitment of support from allies against opponents. Alliance formation during agonistic encounters varies with the dominance rank and matrilineal relatedness of opponents, as well as with the severity of aggression. In contrast to previous interpretations of screams as graded signals reflecting the level of arousal of the caller, these calls are much more discrete, with each of the 5 acoustic types significantly associated with a particular class of opponent and level of physical aggression. A series of field experiments was performed in which tape-recorded screams of immature rhesus monkey were played to their mothers in the absence of any other information. The results suggest that the information for differential responses is conveyed by the scream vocalizations themselves. Screams are  representational signals that refer to external objects and events and function in the system of agonistic alliance formation.

TI DETERMINATION OF SOURCE DISTANCE IN THE SURFACE-FEEDING FISH
   PANTODON-BUCHHOLZI PANTODONTIDAE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The African butterfly fish, P. buchholzi, localizes its prey by means of surface waves of the water. Pantodon also responds and orientates well to artificial, short lasting prey-like signals (clicks), produced by a single air-puff or by dipping a small rod once into the water. When stimulated with clicks, which contain many frequencies, Pantodon determines the source distance (test range 5-20 cm) very precisely, regardless of stimulus amplitude, amplitude modulation and frequency band width. When the signal is a sine wave at a single frequency or with upward frequency modulation, the distance determination is generally impaired, i.e., the distance covered by the fish is too small to reach the wave source. The fish can also be tricked into moving too far by presenting it with a sine wave signal which, at a source distance of only 7 cm, has a frequency modulation equivalent to a click at 15 cm. In contrast to distance determination, the ability to estimate the target angle is independent of the kind of wave signal presented. The results are discussed with respect to possible mechanisms used for prey localization.

TI THE SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION OF FERAL PEAFOWL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Peafowl are usually reported to have a mating system based on harem defenses by adult males. In a small feral population near Oxford [England Uk], males defended small (< 1 ha) territories while females remained in 1 flock that ignored male territory boundaries. After mating, females become solitary. At no time did a female associate selectively with 1 male or remain within his territory, nor did males attempt to follow or guard female groups. Two out of 4 males mated. These differed from the other 2 in being neither very old nor very young; they held territories smaller than that of the young male and were no larger or longer-tailed. They spent more time displaying. It suggested that peafowl have a mating system similar to a lek: males defending small, clumped territories visited by females for mating.

TI A CONFLICTING-TENDENCY MODEL OF SPIDER AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR - HYBRID-PURE
   POPULATION LINE COMPARISONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Contests over web-sites in the spider, Agelenopsis aperta, were simulated by a model in which the next act of a spider is determined by the value of 2 drives or tendencies, to attack and to flee. Such a model can explain the fact that F1 hybrids between 2 geographical races of A. aperta are not intermediate between their parents, but are more aggressive than either. The model also accounts for the following features of the observed contests: contests consist of a series of bouts, during  which the spiders perform increasingly aggressive acts; contests are usually won by the larger spider; if sizes are equal, contests are usually won by the owner; contests over excellent-quality sites are more costly than over poor-quality sites; and transition probabilities for de-escalation, matching and escalation with respect to prior acts show site quality and weight bias trends. It is argued that a 2-tendency model is the simplest that would account for these observations. The model also  accurately simulates spider behavior in agonistic contexts not used in its development (i.e., round-robin contests involving opponents from different populations and a group of contests involving unequally matched hybrid opponents). The main discrepancy between the model and observed encounters is that the model predicts that if the owner is larger, the cost of a contest will not vary with the value of the disputed site. This is because the smaller intruder, having no knowledge of site quality (Riechert 1984) is expected to withdraw early in the contest, regardless of site quality. In the actual contests over excellent sites, estimated costs are higher even when the owner is larger and the intruder loses. The change in intruder behavior associated with site value occurs following the 1st series of actions, but within the 1st bout of the interactions: analyses indicates that any information conveyed by the owner concerning site value is not through overt behavior (i.e., through the frequencies with which specific acts are performed).

TI RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DENSITY AND BEHAVIOR IN JUVENILE
   PSEUDOLABRUS-CELIDOTUS (PISCES, LABRIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The behavior of juvenile (0+) P. celidotus was examined in 13 shallow reef habits in northeastern New Zealand with the aim of assessing the influence of density on the frequency of encounters between individuals and the time allocated to agonistic and foraging behavior. Local density and the frequency of encounters both differed significantly among habits and were positively correlated. The frequency and the mean proportion of the time budget spent on intraspecific agonistic encounters  differed among habits and exhibited bell-shaped relationships to density; aggressive behavior was frequent at intermediate densities, but rare in very low or high density populations. This was explained by an inverse relationship between density and the proportion of encounters resulting in aggressive behavior. There were significant differences among the habits in the amount of time spent foraging, the high level of aggression at intermediate densities being associated with decreased time spent foraging. Juveniles in the 3 highest density habitats foraged mainly on plankton; juveniles at densities lower than 100 per 500 m2 foraged on micro-crustaceans associated with algae.

AB Relative roles of audition, olfaction and vision in the northern grasshopper mouse''s (Onychomys leucogaster) predation on insects was determined. The 1st experiment examined the relative importance of these 3 senses in the localization of a moving or a stationary cricket. Although all 3 senses contributed to finding an active prey, individually or in certain combinations with others, the mice relied predominantly on audition. In contrast when searching for a stationary prey, the mice used vision or olfaction interchangeably. In choice situations where prey cues of 2 sensory modalities were presented simultaneously, the mice preferentially approached auditory cues 1st at a distance. In close proximity to a prey when the decision to attack was involved, they responded mainly to olfactory cues.

TI SOCIAL PREFERENCES FOR PARTNERS CARRYING GOOD GENES IN WILD HOUSE MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female wild strain house mice (M. musculus) can use olfactory cues to discriminate males carrying lethal t-alleles (+/t) from those that do not carry such alleles (+/+). When tested in an arena, female mice tend to avoid +/t males and preferentially direct approaches to +/+ males. The magnitude of a female''s avoidance of +/t males is related to the female''s own genotype. Females who are themselves +/t show greater avoidance than +/+ females. Male mice tend to be more aggressive toward females carrying t-alleles and are less likely to attempt copulations with such females than with +/+ females. These social preferences may be related to mating preferences, providing an example of mating preference based on genetic quality. Avoidance of +/t individuals as mates could account for the lower than expected frequency of t-alleles in natural populations.

TI FLEHMEN, MOUNTING AND COPULATION AMONG MEMBERS OF A SEMI-WILD CATTLE
   HERD
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Over a period of 2.5 yr the occurrence of flehmen, mounting and copulation among members of a semi-wild cattle herd was recorded and their relationships to age, sex and stage of reproduction studied. Flehmen and mounting exhibited towards a female not in estrus were shown more frequently by male than by female calves. Females were the preferred partners for flehmen, males for mounting. While the development of flehmen was characterized by a bimodal trend, mounting activity was pronounced only during the 1st year of life; it declined at the weaning and remained at low levels during the 2nd and 3rd years of life. Pregnant cowss were never mounted by the adult bull of the herd. Male calves, mounted them regularly. During early gestation, cows elicited more flehmen than during advanced gestation. The flehmen rate was highest in the adult bull, with subadult males ranking 2nd and juveniles 3rd. Males maneuvered estrous females to the periphery of the herd. They made no consequent use of their relative dominance status and none of them copulated with more than 1/2 of all estrus cows. Sons never copulated with their mothers. Males engaged in copulation, flehmen and mounting more with estrous cows who conceived than with those who failed to conceive. The difference was pronounced in the adult bull; it was shown as a trend in subadults.

TI SEQUENCES OF SONG IN CHAFFINCHES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male chaffinches (F. coelebs) have between 1 and 6 different song types in their repertoire. Individuals with more than 1 sing a series or bout of each type before switching to another. Individuals with more than 2 tend to cycle through their repertoire, singing a series of each in turn. Some 1st-order transitions are more common than expected by chance. The tendency to cycle through the repertoire is so strong that the occurrence of a rare sequence can be predicted when a particular song has not been sung for some time. Competition between song types for expression may be a more important influence on their sequence than direct effects between successive songs. Two birds with unusual patterning, involving the occurrence of the same song type more than once in the cycle, are discussed. In these cases, a single type may be controlled by 2 separate systems. It may also be learned from 2 separate sources.

TI COMPETITION FOR MATES AND PREDOMINANT JUVENILE MALE DISPERSAL IN MAMMALS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Competition among males for mates may partially explain the predominant dispersal of juvenile male California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi). The generality of this hypothesis was tested by comparing dispersal patterns in many species of mammals. In most polygynous and promiscuous species of mammals, juvenile males are the predominant dispersers. In most monogamous species of mammals, juvenile males and juvenile females are predominant dispersers with little distinction as to sex. While many factors may influence dispersal, achieving outcrossing and advantages in competition for mates are most likely to explain predominant dispersal by juvenile males in many mammal species.

TI SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION IN THE DUSKY-FOOTED WOODRAT (NEOTOMA-FUSCIPES) - A
   FIELD AND LABORATORY STUDY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The dusky-footed woodrat has been characterized as solitary and asocial. Some of the parameters of woodrat social organization were investigated. In the field a distinct group of woodrats was live-trapped, marked and released at bi-weekly intervals from Feb. to June. Residents (22) were identified and 21 of 34 houses were occupied. Visiting occurred regularly, most often at non-occupied houses. Males were unlikely to be visited at their house and were more likely to visit occupied houses than females. Females were visited at home and visited each other. In June the population was removed to the laboratory where paired encounters with familiar and unfamiliar woodrats were used to examine the effect of sex and familiarity on social interactions. Both females and males interacted little with familiar same sex conspecifics, with the behavior of 1 member of such pairs being very inhibited. Females with strange females were more interactive and spent more time in contact. Neither sex clearly differentiated between familiar and strange conspecifics of the opposite sex. Males were agonistic of affiliative in encounters with females. The type of response was consistent for a given male, and females responded differently to the 2 types. Woodrats differentiate between same sex conspecifics and show sufficient individual variability to make individual recognition possible and adaptive.

TI PRODUCERS AND SCROUNGERS - A GENERAL-MODEL AND ITS APPLICATION TO
   CAPTIVE FLOCKS OF HOUSE SPARROWS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Many forms of interaction within and between species seem based on scrounger individuals or species exploiting a limited resource provided by producers. A mathematical model is presented which shows whether or not scroungers are maintained in a group, depending on their frequency and the group size. Some of the predictions of the model were tested in captive flocks of house sparrows P. domesticus L. Here the scroungers obtained most of their food (mealworms) by interaction and the producers found most of their food by actively foraging: the pay-off to each type was measured as mealworm capture rate. Neither type changed strategy opportunistically in response to instantaneous flock composition, but scroungers fared better when 1 or more producers were present. Scroungers did much worse than expected when greatly outnumbered by producers, perhaps because producers then found the available food quickly.

TI MATE SELECTION IN THE FLY SCATOPHAGA-STERCORARIA - FEMALE CHOICE IN A
   MALE-CONTROLLED SYSTEM
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sexual pairing in the fly S. stercoraria involves capture of females by males. Size-related choice by males and females is considered, because these flies are highly variable in size and size strongly affects reproductive success. Males do not discriminate among females on the basis of size. Females choose large males when free to select mates. They move toward larger males when confronted by more than 1 possible mate, and their movement on the oviposition site takes them to areas where large males are more common. Females paired with large males gain from reduced harm in struggles; more rapid copulation and oviposition, with lower risk to the female and her progeny/ and greater ability to escape danger during copulation. These benefits may account for female preference for large males.

TI COMBAT AND COMMUNICATION IN THE EVERGLADES PYGMY SUNFISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Changes in population density and resource patterning affect the aggressive behavior of pygmy sunfish (E. everglaidei) in many ways. Increases in density significantly reduce the proportion of fights directly over clumped prey, the likelihood of initiators winning contests or acquiring clumped prey and the length of contests. Increases in prey dispersion also reduce the proportion of resource fights in low- and high-density populations, the greater tendency for subordinates to initiate fights directly over resources, the likelihood of initiators acquiring a contested prey item in low density populations, and the length of contests. Such increases increase the likelihood of initiators winning contests at moderate competitive levels, and increase the effectiveness of rapid sequential communication in populations that abandon territoriality. Some findings, such as the inverse relationship between contest length and both prey dispersion and rank differential, are consistent with predictions of cost-benefit models of fighting behavior, namely, that escalated contests become more likely as asymmetries in fighting ability decrease and asymmetries in resource valuation simultaneously increase.

AB Reliable forced movement orders were obtained for Merino sheep tested in both inside (woolshed) and outside (yard) races. Three homogeneous groups of 20 sheep each contained 10 animals which responded (sociable) or did not respond to short-term separation from the flock. Sociable sheep vocalized (30% of ewes and 20% of wethers) or were uncooperative (10% of wethers). Orders were more reliable for wethers than ewes, and most reliable for the uncooperative subgroup. Whereas both vocal ewes and uncooperative wethers moved at the rear of the order, vocal wethers occupied middle positions. Implications for studies of spatial leadership in sheep are discussed.

TI MATING-BEHAVIOR IN THE AUSTRALIAN REPTILE TICK APONOMMA-HYDROSAURI
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Females of the Australian reptile tick A. hydrosauri make few movements once they are attached to a host. Males move significantly more often on hosts with females attached. Male movement often leads to contact and courtship with females. Movement is most frequent in the early part of the dark phase of a photoperiod. After contact the courtship, both on the host and in experimentally induced off-host situations, follows a stereotyped sequence of positional orientations, here divided into 6 phases. Copulation does not automatically follow courtship initiation and successful courtship requires females to respond to male initiation by lifting their hind legs to allow the male to crawl under. Compared to other animal species, the males of A. hydrosauri play an unusually passive role in mate seeking. This may be explained by the extremely patchy distribution of the mate finding environment, lizards.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB Prairie deer mice (P. m. bairdii), living in asymptotic laboratory populations established 2 yr earlier, were observed for agonistic responses to conspecific intruders. In the 1st experiment, intruders of 6 age-sex classes were placed into 10 populations for 10 min. The sex of the intruder did not influence the behavior of the residents, but juveniles elicited more aggression than did adults. A 2nd experiment revealed that female residents were responsible for almost all attacks upon juveniles. Experiment 3, in which the responses of pairs of deer mice to juvenile intruders were recorded, demonstrated that the aggressiveness of a female was enhanced by the presence of a male. In a final experiment, females were highly aggressive during the 1st few days after giving birth. The aggressive behavior of the female deer mouse may have greater significance for population dynamics than that of the male.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The present study on maternal imprinting in goats initially failed to replicate previous findings that mothers discriminate between their own and alien young, accepting their own kid and rejecting alien kids. Of the mothers, 62% accepted both their own and alien kid. This disparity was not due to breed differences, age or behavior of the aliens but to length of time the alien kids had been with their own mother. When behavior was eliminated through anesthesia or left intact, older aliens that had had no contact with their mother were accepted by other mothers, while those aliens with more than 8 h of contact with their own mothers were rejected (whether anesthetized or not) by other mothers. Maternal imprinting in goats may take longer than previously reported, and mothers may label their kids and learn to recognize the labels.

TI MOVEMENT PATTERNS IN DUNG BEETLES AND IN THE DUNG FLY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Movements in coprophagous beetles between cow pats are discussed in relation to 2 hypotheses; that the movement patterns are results of selection to maximize the net rate of energy intake and that the rates of immigration to and emigration from droppings are governed by simple stochastic rules of behavior. Observations support the latter hypothesis and contrast with predictions from the simplest optimization model. Reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Spatio-temporal occurrence of the dung fly, S. stercoraria, around cow pats is re-analyzed from Parker''s data. A simple Markov chain model predicts the observations well but does not solve the question of the type of selection responsible for the values of the behavioral parameters. Difficulties in coping with a stochastic environment and the consequences of movements being manifested on many spatial and temporal levels favor evolution consisting of a few key behavioral parameters being singled out and subsequently adjusted by selection.

TI SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG ADULT FEMALE MOUNTAIN GORILLAS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Because gorilla females transfer between breeding units, those in the study groups were probably distantly related and not familiar in immaturity. Apparently as a consequence, affinitive behavior between most females was rare. One mother-daughter pair and 1 pair of females familiar from immaturity had obviously friendly relationships in adulthood. Within dyads, younger partners groomed more. Young infants markedly affected females'' relationships, though estrus did not. Familiarity in immaturity might be necessary for affinity between females in adulthood, and friendly behaviors, even between relatives, could be essentially selfish. Costs and benefits to females in group living, and the effect of habitat quality on relationships are briefly discussed.

TI INTRASPECIFIC AGGRESSION IN THE LEAF-CUTTING ANT ACROMYRMEX-OCTOSPINOSUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In the field, individuals of A. octospinosus taken from widely separated nests are much more hostile towards one another than ants taken from local ones. Individuals taken from different laboratory colonies which have been foraging similar plant material do not fight, but if the colonies are supplied with different forage materials, mutual investigation by workers increases with time until aggression is exhibited. If colonies are split into 2 and maintained on different forage, non-injurious aggression occurs when they are recombined. In this ant species both endogenous (genetic) and exogenous (environmental) factors contribute to colony odor, the latter being the more important. In the recognition of strange workers, the 2 factors appear to synergize each other.

TI INTER-TROOP TRANSFER AND INBREEDING AVOIDANCE IN PAPIO-ANUBIS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In 3 adjacent troops of olive baboons (P. anubis), all males emigrated from their natal troop. There is evidence that the costs of inbreeding depression may exceed those of transferring to another troop. Migrations which were unlikely to be due to the avoidance of inbreeding were made by males with above average reproductive activity into troops with more estrous females than the prior troop. During inter-troop encounters, immigrant (transferred) males acted in ways that reduced the contact of females of their own troop with outsiders and lowered the probability of newcomers joining the troop. Natal males showed interest in members of the other troop. Male dominance was strongly related to age, and in transferred males reproductive activity was related to dominance. In natal males dominance increased with age but reproductive activity decreased. Instead of engaging in aggressive competition for access to estrous females, natal males mated surreptitiously. Females showed a preference for transferred males over natal males, and for males who could not have been their father over males who could have been.

TI EGG RECOGNITION - ITS ADVANTAGE TO A BUTTERFLY
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Ovipositing females of the pipevine swallowtail butterfly, B. philenor, detect the presence of eggs laid by other females on their host plants. The presence of eggs on a plant inhibits oviposition by a female that discovers it. The selection pressure responsible for the evolution and maintenance of discrimination against plants with eggs appears to be lower survival from egg to adult of eggs laid on plants already containing eggs than on plants without eggs.

AB Air currents with and without sex pheromone were presented perpendicularly to the dorsum of individual male and female American cockroaches P. americana on horizontal and vertical surfaces. Males and females on the horizontal surface turned in small angles (0-90.degree.) in response to air currents with and without sex pheromone (horizontal object orientation). On the vertical surface, tethered males and females consistently moved upward in response to air currents without sex pheromone (predator-avoidance), while males moved downward in response to air currents with sex pheromone (mate-finding). Male and female vertical distributions in a semi-natural situation revealed that most males were found above some females.

TI DAYTIME REST AND ACTIVITY IN SOCIALLY LIVING RHESUS-MONKEY INFANTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

AB In rhesus monkey infants of 6 and 16 wk, daytime periods of rest and activity can be distinguished and the transitions between such periods are usually brief (300-600 s) relative to the median durations of the rests (at least 1200 s). Using the criterion at least 700 s spent continuously within 60 cm of mother, the rest periods thereby distinguished are also times of almost continuous nipple contact. In contrast, active periods involve frequent short visits to the mother''s side, with a small percentage of time spent in nipple contact during those visits. Problems of analysis which use behavioral measures of state are discussed.

TI ONTOGENY OF SLEEP AND WAKE STATES IN THE RABBIT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Behavioral state organization in the rabbit from birth to 30 days is described. Rabbits were observed individually and judgment of the predominant state and occurrences of specific behaviors were recorded every 10 s. The following states were defined; active waking, quiet waking, drowse, active sleep without REM [rapid eye movement], REM-active sleep, quiet sleep, indefinite, Q-state and freeze stare. A 2nd study produced a quantitative description of behavioral state development. Wake time increases with age associated with an increase in duration of waking episodes. Sleep remains relatively constant in duration; but the number of episodes decreases. Active sleep decreases with age, but the percentage of active sleep that is REM-active sleep increases with age. Sleep states are asymptotic by the 3rd wk. Findings confirm and extend those derived from electrophysiological recordings.

Body weight was a significant factor in determining dominance in both populations and paired individuals. Chipmunks establish and define a dominance core area in the vicinity of their nest box. Factors such as a previous social experience and the physiological state of the female may affect the sociability of the species.

TI PLAY PARTNERS OF IMMATURE BABOONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB In a troop of free-ranging baboons, infants played predominantly with each other, and played most with the infant of the highest-ranking female in their mothers'' subgroup. The frequency of infant play appeared to be affected both by age and by the number of ages of other infants in the troop. Juveniles and subadults played more with their siblings than with other animals of their siblings'' age. Juvenile and subadult females played primarily with infants, and played most with infants whose mothers ranked higher than their own. Juvenile and subadult males played most with like-sexed peers. The distribution of play partners among immatures illustrates how demographic and maturational factors, and those related to kinship, may reinforce or counteract one another during development.

TI CHICK COLOR APPROACH PREFERENCES ARE ALTERED BY COLD STRESS - COLOR
   PECKING AND APPROACH PREFERENCES ARE SAME
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Color approach preferences in 1-day-old New Hampshire and White Leghorn chicks were assessed by choice preference tests between pairs of differently colored floors, illuminated by light passed through different interference filters and adjusted to equal luminance. The preferences closely resembled color pecking preferences reported previously for domestic chicks, e.g., a preference for blue over green. The latter preference could be reversed by cold stress; chicks tested similarly but in a cold noisy room (18.9.degree. C) preferred green over blue. The role of noise in this reversal effect was eliminated, since chicks tested in a warm noisy room showed the normal blue over green preference. Chick color pecking and approach preferences are normally the same, not different, and certainly not spectral mirror-image reversals in contrast to prior conclusions. Instead, a more restricted preference reversal (i.e., in the blue-green spectral regions) occurs as a result of cold stress.

TI AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR IN DOMESTIC HENS - INFLUENCE OF HOUSING METHOD AND
   GROUP-SIZE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The incidence of agonistic behavior was recorded over 1 yr in laying hens of 2 strains, housed either in battery cages or in deep-litter pens in groups of either 3 or 6 birds. Aggressive head-pecking was more frequent in pens than in cages and in groups of 6 than in groups of 3. Threats were more frequent in pens and in groups of 6 light-hybrids. Other pecking at the plumage was more common in cages in groups of 6 and in the light-hybrid than in the medium-hybrid strain. Hens occupied a considerable area when engaging in threat displays: this suggests that the physical restraint of crowding may play an important part in limiting this behavior. Two reasons for the reduction of aggressive head pecking in caged birds are suggested: 1st, inhibition of the subordinate hens'' behavior because they were constantly in the sphere of influence of the dominant bird and 2nd, because agonistic encounters may be triggered only by the entry of other birds into an individual''s personal space and not by continuous proximity.

AB A given male of P. johnsoni has at his disposal 2 alternative types of courtship. Each consists of distinctly different motor patterns and involves different sensory channels. If the male encountered a female outside her nest, type 1 courtship was used. Type 2 courtship occurred if the male encountered a female inside her nest. Spiders do not respond to visual stimuli (house flies) under red light. The fact that type 2, but not type 1, courtship occurred when spiders were observed under red light was taken as evidence that type 1 is vision dependent, whereas type 2 is not vision dependent. Selection factors favoring the evolution of courtship versatility are discussed.

This approach led to the development of a large catalogue of facial/vocal behavior which was used in the systematic observation of 75 girl and boy infants, who in the last quarter of the 1st yr of life were placed in a series of standardized laboratory situations. Each of the 42 facial expressions contained in the catalogue is precisely defined according to the expressive elements of the brow, eyes, mouth and other facial regions. The vocalizations are also operationally defined. The possible ways that the facial expressions and vocalizations could be combined in the expression of emotional behavior in infants were discussed.

TI ANALYSIS OF SAND-BATHING AND GROOMING IN KANGAROO RAT
   (DIPODOMYS-MERRIAMI)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The sandbathing and grooming behavior of 10 kangaroo rats (D. merriami) were recorded on sand and woodchip substrates after periods of 0, 1, 5 and 10 days without sand. Sandbathing is restricted to the sandy substrate. Grooming occurs on both, but with a higher frequency on sand. Increases in both grooming and sandbathing occur with increasing sand deprivation, but the temporal patterning does not change. D. merriami tends to alternate sandbathing components in contrast to other Dipodomys spp. Lipid on the pelage increases noticeably with sand deprivation and decreases during a sandbathing bout; sand appears to be removed from the pelage by shaking and grooming. These findings suggest a 3-process system for care of the body surface.

TI DEVELOPMENT AND ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF FEEDING TECHNIQUES IN REED
   WARBLER (ACROCEPHALUS-SCIRPACEUS)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Wild reed warblers use several techniques to capture their insect prey (mainly Diptera). Different techniques are used for different prey and so vary with prey activity. Independent young birds pick stationary prey from foliage more frequently than adults, which often catch prey in mid-air. This is not because the young need time to develop feeding skills. Captive birds which did not have experience of flies until fully grown were no worse at capturing them than birds which had had continuous experience from an early age. Adults probably use more energy-demanding techniques in order to collect enough food for their young as well as themselves. However, rapid learning of prey handling ability is restricted to a sensitive period early in development, before structural maturation of the bill is completed.

TI SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR IN CONFINED POPULATIONS OF ALLEGHENY WOODRAT,
   NEOTOMA-FLORIDANA MAGISTER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Low-density groups of Allegheny woodrats (N. f. magister) confined in a 65 m2 cage exhibited despotic social organization in which 1 .alpha. rat killed or wounded all other group members within 14 days in each of 5 experiments. Five of 7 high-density groups, consisting of 6-14 rats in 9.5 m2 cages, were characterized by dominance hierarchies and high levels of social interaction. Two unisexual groups remained disorganized and all but 1 rat died in both cases. Allegheny woodrats utilized a different alarm signal and exhibited higher levels of agonistic and sexual interaction compared to similar groups of a California subspecies (N. fuscipes macrotus) which occupies a distinctly different habitat.

TI TEMPORAL PATTERN OF FEEDING OVER ESTROUS-CYCLE OF MOUSE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The detailed temporal pattern of feeding in female mice was measured by an automated method over the estrous cycle while feeding on either of 2 foods differing in stimulus characteristics, but of similar calorific value. The total time spent feeding varied systematically over the cycle, being increased for sweet food and decreased for laboratory chow at the time of sexual receptivity, and increased for both foods towards the end of the cycle. The temporal pattern is analyzed into a number of variables, which are seen to alter in different ways over the estrous cycle. The pro-estrus disturbance is due to alterations in meal size brought about solely by changes in mean bout length, themselves products of variations in the initial bouts of the meal. Inter-meal interval is unrelated to changes in meal size at this time, allowing the latter to affect food intake. The changes towards the end of the cycle are produced by alterations of meal frequency at constant meal size. Separable phasic and tonic effects of reproductive condition on feeding may be identified and they might possibly have different functions.

TI SENSITIVITY TO ODORS IN EMBRYO OF DOMESTIC-FOWL
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Sensitivity to odors in the embryo of the domestic fowl was investigated on the day before hatching. Embryos were tested with 4 odorants: dichloroethane, cineole, amyl acetate and formic acid. Three odorants (dichloroethane, formic acid and cineole) produced an increase in the heart rate and a rise in the rates of beak-clapping and the first 2 increased the amount of head-shaking. Odorants had little effect on other types of activity. The response to amyl acetate varied. Blocking the nostrils with wax abolished the response. Some implications of these results are discussed briefly.

TI ACOUSTIC FREQUENCY DISCRIMINATION IN GOLDFISH
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The capacity of the goldfish (Carassius auratus) to discriminate between 2 acoustic frequencies was tested by means of avoidance conditioning techniques. The pulsed-tone method was used in which the subject had to discriminate between a pulsed single frequency and pulses of 2 frequencies in alternation. Sound pressure levels were kept at 0 dB re 1 [mu]b. This is equivalent to a sensation level of 40 to 45 dB at the frequencies used. Discrimination limens (JND) were determined by the staircase audiometric method. At 200 Hz, the mean JND was 9. 4 Hz (4. 7% difference); at 500 Hz, the mean JND was 17. 4 Hz (3. 5% difference); and at 1000 Hz, the mean JND was 50.1 Hz (5.0% difference). Comparison with human frequency discrimination showed that the goldfish JND was an order of magnitude greater. The problem of frequency analysis in fish was discussed.

AB Pups from 3 litters were monitored with an ultrasound receiver while isolated under standard conditions. Systematic detections were made with a bandwidth of 5 KHz. and a range of central frequencies from 35 to 55 KHz. Quantitative and qualitative changes occured with age in the ultrasonic distress calls from the pups. The rate of calling did not seem to be related to the pups'' effectiveness in eliciting maternal behaviors in adults because it is apparently lowest when the pups were most efficient, i. e., during the 1st days after birth. The effectiveness of the calls might depend upon qualitative changes.

TI LEARNING IN NEONATAL RAT
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB For the first 3 days after birth, 5 groups of rats were differentially reared in order to vary learning opportunities. One of the groups was reared in an incubator and tube-fed. The other 4 groups were reared by foster mothers, and 3 of these groups were additionally treated with stimulus components of the artificial feeding situation. After only 18 feedings, or learning trials, incubator-reared pups were found to respond to being handled and to being stimulated with the feeding tube with very active wriggling, squealing and suckling movements, whereas most untreated pups either did not respond or responded negatively to the test stimuli. In a test situation in which a pup could orient towards either a surrogate mother or a live rat mother, only 3 of the untreated pups moved at all. These went directly to the mother and suckled immediately. The incubator pups went to both the surrogate and to the mother, and more suckled. Rather than indicating group preferences, this test revealed a striking difference between untreated and incubator-reared pups in their activity level.

TI SACCHARIN REVERSES EFFECT OF FOOD DEPRIVATION UPON FLUID INTAKE IN MICE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Mice drinking water (approximately 8 ml/day) reduced their fluid intake to 1-2 ml/day when food deprived. Mice drinking a maximally preferred sodium saccharin solution, 0.77% w/v for C57BL/ 6J mice and 0.38% w/v for DBA/2J mice, doubled or tripled their fluid intake during food deprivation. The effect was more pronounced in strain C57BL/6J. Ingestion of saccharin solution did not ameliorate weight loss. Strengths of saccharin preference and blood glucose concentration were negatively correlated during an initial period of food deprivation, but during a 2nd period the correlation was nonsignificant. The 2 variables may be fortuitously related. It was hypothesized that during food deprivation regulation of saccharin solution ingestion is shifted from a thirst motivation to a hunger motivation system.

TI TEMPORAL PATTERN OF NOCTURNAL ACTIVITY OF A CAGED FOX SPARROW
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Fox sparrows in registration cages exhibited migratory activity which was correlated with the normal season of migration. Detailed analysis of the temporal pattern of activity of a single bird indicated that this migratory activity is composed of rhythmical bouts of locomotion. In the early hours of the evening bursts of activity were arhythmical and probably correlated with preening activities which anticipate normal migratory movements. Later in the evening the activity became highly rhythmical, the length of the rhythm varying seasonally and through the night. The periodicity ranged from 30 sec. or more to a frequency such that the activity bouts merged with one another and activity was continuous. This rhythmical activity proceeded very evenly throughout the rest of the night. The analyses reported here were made in June, after the normal migration had ended and breeding activity was well under way. The heaviest migratory activity of caged birds occurred as a continuous performance in which the bout structure was not apparent. Only as the activity slows can the activity rhythm be behaviorally distinguished. These rhythms may have a neuronal basis and a continuous performance of activity which is apparently arhythmical may have a rhythmical neuronal correlate. The migratory bird in flight may be urged on by rhythmical nervous discharge. Environmental factors end both the evening flight and the migratory sojourn. In looking back to the earlier part of the season in which migratory activity in the caged bird is reflected by a continuous performance a question arises. Is it still possible to postulate a bout structure ? If the hypothesis that the bouts are based upon rhythmical discharge of neuronal elements is correct, then it is possible that the discharge is occurring at a sufficiently frequent rate to elicit continuous behavior. This may explain why rhythmicity emerges only after the level of activity is lowered enough to permit the emergence of inactive durations between activity bouts.

TI RESPONSE OF CARDINALS TO SONGS OF DIFFERENT DIALECTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Tape recorded songs of cardinals (Richmondena cardinalis) were played to territorial males near Komoka and Melbourne, Ontario, Canada. Birds in both areas heard a local song; those at Komoka also heard a song recorded at a location 7 miles (11 km) distant and one recorded in Texas, a distance of over 2000 miles (3200 km); those at Melbourne also heard a song from a 21-mile (34 km) distance. The responses were judged by the number of songs given, and by the tendency to approach the playing loudspeaker. At both localities, birds responded far more to the local songs. The response at Komoka to the song from a 7-mile distance was somewhat greater than to the song from Texas, at least in terms of the number of approaches. Responses were minimal to the song from Texas played at Komoka and to the song from a 21-mile distance played at Melbourne.

TI REINFORCING EFFECTS OF CHAFFINCH SONG
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB When young chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) turned on either white noise or song in an operant situation, a reinforcing effect of song, but not noise, was found. For one out of 8 birds in the noise group, responding to an active perch, divided by responding to both the active and an inactive perch, was significantly lower when the active perch did produce noise than when it did not. In contrast, this ratio was significantly higher when the active perch did produce song than when it did not for 5 out of 8 birds in the song group. However, the effects of song on responding to the active perch did not overcome initial perch preferences and did not produce a high steady rate of responding.

TI AGGREGATION IN APHIS FABAE SCOP .2. VISUAL COMPONENTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB An examination was made of the behavior of apterous A. fabae alienicolae in a number of simple visual situations representing the different components of the visual situation presented by a live stationary aphid. Most walking aphids approached black objects in a manner typical of the simple opto-motor behavior which mediates ''form vision'' or skototaxis . Newly moulted aphids approached and then orbited such objects in a manner suggesting that stimulation of the triommatidium of such aphids might also be involved. Walking aphids stopped and probed (i) when the angle subtended by silhouettes directly ahead of them reached a critical value, (ii) when visual stimulation occurred with sufficient rapidity, (iii) when the aphids were constrained by their dorsal light reaction to walk along ridges past objects towards which they would otherwise have turned. The distribution of probes in (iii) was independent of the angular velocity of the object in the visual field of the moving aphid but again suggested that stimulation via the triommatidium might be involved.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
AB In a 2-mil-lion liter salt water tank at Marineland of the Pacific, California, Sarda chiliensis, 57 cm. in fork length, swam continuously at 88.2 cm/ sec. during the day when not feeding or courting. Speed of feeding fish (body lengths/sec.) equaled 0.4905 plus 0.6394 times the tail beats/ sec. A transient vertically barred pattern of coloration occurred on the flanks of feeding fish. Coutrship included temporary pairing, aggressive defense of a female, and a sequence leading to simultaneous and adjacent release of gametes. A sexual dimorphism in behavior released pair formation. Threat among males included an intense vertically barred coloration similar to the transient pattern of feeding bonito. Mouth closures, yawns, snaps, leans, and bends were described, and functions associated with olfaction, gill ventilation, drinking, schooling, and food passage were considered.

TI INTERACTION AMONG WORKERS FROM DIFFERENT COLONIES OF SWEAT BEES
   ]HYMENOPTERA HALICTIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Lasioglossum versatum, a bee whose colonies occur in small, dense aggregations, shows tolerance and some interactions among individuals of different colonies and thus social activity at a level above that usual among social insects. Studies were made in the field with numerous uniquely marked individuals in each of several adjoining colonies. Guards admit individuals from any colony. Burrows made by different colonies sometimes interconnect. Most of all workers are attached primarily to one colony but often enter others. When they do so, they frequently leave immediately but may remain and may leave pollen loads, probably being stimulated to do so by cues such as they would encounter in their own nests. The result must be a certain degree of cooperative interaction among colonies. However, advantages of such interaction are not obvious and visits to wrong nests probably result from errors in nest recognition.

TI MATERNAL BEHAVIOUR IN VIRGIN FEMALE GOLDEN HAMSTERS (MESOCRICETUS
   AURATUS WATERHOUSE) - ROLE OF AGE OF TEST PUP
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB 144 native virgin female golden hamsters were each given a single 15 min test with 3 pups aged from day 1 (<24 hr) to day 18. A group of 8 females was tested with each age of pup. Pups aged from day 1 to day 6 were generally attacked like prey, killed and eaten. Pups of intermediate age (day 6 to day 10) were usually initially attacked but this was often followed by maternal responses. The females'' behavior with the oldest pups suggested that they were being treated as strange adult intruders. This result differs from that of a similar experiment with mice in which the youngest pups were found to be the most effective for eliciting maternal responses. An explanation for this difference in terms of the evolutionary history of the golden hamster species is proposed.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The locomotory behavior in grain of a pyrethrum resistant Rpy) and susceptible strain (S) of the grain weevil Sitophilus granarlus (L.) is compared. Speed of movement falls during the first 2 wk. of life from 74.7 to 49.7 mm/min in S individuals and from 40.1 to 27.9 mm/ min in Rpy individuals. The speed of the 2 strains drops to 39.3 mm/min (S) and 24.8 mm/min (Rpy) in the 4th wk of life and then remains fairly constant. Although S individuals move about twice as fast as Rpy, they achieve only 50% greater direct linear displacement. This is due to a less direct pattern of movement. A greater proportion of S individuals move in all tests. In the absence of grain, S individuals move 1.6 times as fast as Rpy. In both strains, mated, unmated and individuals mated and then isolated, behave similarly. The greater size of Rpy individuals is considered to be only a minor factor in determining their locomotory behavior.

LA English
DT Article
AB Parental behavior was studied and reported from a large number of incbating hen pheasants and 4 incubating cocks. The development of behavior in the first half of incubation is coincident with the rapid rise in prolactin content of the pheasant pituitary. Experimental reduction and prolongation of the incubation period yielded data which suggest that prolactin has a conditioning effect on the broody hen. Prior to the conditioning a premature hatching stimulus did not elicit brooding behavior in hens with no previous breeding experience. Cocks which incubated showed the same development of behavior and broody activity which is observed in hens.

TI EXPERIENCE EFFECT ON INITIAL ORIENTATION IN PIGEON HOMING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB More than 3300 individual releases of homing pigeons were made at 12 release areas located at 30 degree intervals on a circle of radius 10 miles around the loft. The loft was located near Bowling Green, Ohio. A comparison of the initial orientation of inexperienced birds and those given different kinds of experience was made. A single release can cause quite a large deviation in the results of the next release. Evenwhenthe individual releases are varied in direction by 60 or more degrees to prevent a training in one direction, an accumulation of experience over several releases can create a deflection in headings determined by an average of the past experience. The direction of the deflection, but not the amount, is predictable. There is considerable variation in the amount depending on the release point used and the experience involved. Points at which inexperienced birds gave quite scatered headings appeared to show larger deflections due to provide experience. Not more than 3 releases in a new sequence are sufficient to change the headings of birds thoroughly trained on an old sequence. A few releases conducted from 50 miles yielded similar results.

The fish did not orient to any particular region of the stimulus consisting of uniform black and white vertical stripes. The rpm (revolutions/min. ) of the fish was generally greater than rpm of the drum. On the other hand, the fish oriented to the panel stimulus and tended to remain near it during the entire range of revolutions. The rpm of the fish closely followed the rpm of the drum. Certain features of the behavior of the fish in an optomotor apparatus are compared with certain features of schooling under natural conditions.

AB In a visual exploratory situation, viewing behavior permitted the separation of frontal-lesioned, inferotemporal-lesioned, and normal monkeys. Temporals showed less total stimulus viewing, but the ratio of number to duration of window-opening responses was approximately that of normal animals. Frontals, on the other hand, tended to show alterations primarily in the duration of their responses, without any substatial change in number of responses. Determination of stimulus preference was possible on the basis of the total number of seconds spent looking at each of the 4 stimulus situations. Moving electric trains elicited the most viewing, followed by room alone, and hardboard. A monkey doll elicited mixed reactions.

AB Acoustic signals are primarily used for long-distance communication between conspecifics, but other species may eavesdrop on these signals. Aberrant vocalizations can disrupt information transfer, affecting the responses of both conspecifics and heterospecifics. Individuals with aberrant vocalizations may attempt to compensate, such as by increasing their signal production rate, but compensatory mechanisms remain largely unexplored, especially in species with innate vocalizations. It is also unclear whether such compensation influences the behaviour of eavesdropping heterospecifics. The common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus, an obligate brood parasite, produces a distinct innate 'cu-coo' call by males. We conducted field playback experiments during the breeding season using synthesized normal and aberrant (with syntax error, 'cu-cu-coo') cuckoo calls, as well as control wood pigeon calls. Our findings showed that cuckoos responded most strongly to high-rate normal cuckoo calls, followed by low-rate normal calls, while showing significantly less interest in syntactically aberrant and control calls, regardless of call rate. Noncuckoo (potential host) bird species also responded most strongly to high-rate normal cuckoo calls, but their response to low-rate normal and high-rate syntactically aberrant calls was similar. These results suggest that while cuckoos and other bird species primarily respond to normal cuckoo calls, noncuckoo species may still respond relatively strongly to high-rate syntactically aberrant calls. This study highlights the complexity of interspecific acoustic interactions and suggests that syntactically aberrant vocalizations in cuckoos may disrupt communication between conspecifics while still influencing the responses of eavesdropping heterospecifics.

AB Echinolittorina malaccana, a marine gastropod living on rocky shores along the Indo-West Pacific coasts, shows consistent mate choice in which males prefer to mate with females slightly larger than themselves. Previous studies suggest that the strength of this preference is, to a certain extent, context dependent, being influenced by both demographic and individual (potentially genetic) factors. To disentangle how exactly these factors contribute to male mate choice for size in E. malaccana, we employed modified versions of a previous mate choice experiment using a range of female and male size classes. Mate choice was measured from the same male individuals across different experimental days, thus allowing the analysis of the repeatability of male preferences, as well as the comparison of the strength of mate choice with previous experimental designs and data from wild populations. Two parallel experiments (presenting either the same or different female individuals to males across days) were conducted, which allowed the inference of whether size alone, or additionally with other traits, influences mate choice. Results showed that male preference for females slightly larger than themselves remained consistent in both experiments, although its specific characteristics (e.g. strength of preference, extent of size bias) differed from previous studies. This suggests that the estimation of mate choice in E. malaccana is sensitive to experimental approaches and, to a certain extent, context dependent. The repeatability of mate choice (0-0.36) was only significant in the experiments where males were presented with the same female individuals. Mate choice is, therefore, primarily based on size, but other factors such as female quality or imprinting may modify this choice and lead to discrepancies in repeatability between experiments.

AB Behavioural laterality, reflecting the asymmetry of brain structure and/or function, may influence an individual's fitness and has received increasing research efforts in recent years. The repeatability of the lateralized behaviour is a precondition of its correlation with fitness traits. Currently, studies on the repeatability of behavioural lateralization are mainly focused on captive animals, with knowledge about wild populations remaining scarce. We examined the repeatability of the preference of foot use (i.e. footedness) for grasping food against a perch in wild-caught Japanese tits, Parus minor, by testing a group of captive-raised birds within 16 days and testing the birds living in the wild, with a recapture interval ranging from 0 days to 1169 days. We found that an individual's sex and test interval did not affect its footedness score. High repeatability of footedness was found for both the captive group and the wild- recapture group. Across different recapture intervals of the wild-recapture group (0-60 days, 61-120 days, 121-365 days, >1 year), repeatability varied between 0.765 and 0.989, suggesting consistent foot use preference across seasons. Compared to the lateralized behaviours in most other species, footedness in wild Japanese tits showed a higher level of repeatability. We suggest that the birds in the family Paridae could be ideal systems for understanding the evolution of behavioural/cerebral lateralization for their potential to explore the interplay between lateralization and other fitness-related behaviours in the wild.

AB Dolphin communication involves acoustic signals, including whistles, and the well-studied bottlenose dolphins produce individually distinctive whistles called signature whistles (SWs). The production of a potential SW by an injured Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin has been reported, but no study has attempted to validate this finding in this species. Using data collected during encounters with free- ranging Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins at two locations in the northern South China Sea, we investigated the production of SWs by these dolphins. Of the 3846 analysed whistles, 37% were identified as potential SWs (PSWs) using the SIGnature whistle IDentification method and categorized into 82 PSW types. Overall, PSWs were identified during 54% of encounters. Given the high production rate of stereotyped whistles (62% of all whistles in 90% of encounters) compared with the identified PSWs, we suggest that the SIGnature whistle IDentification method criteria cannot be fully adapted for the detection of SWs in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, and more research should be conducted to adapt the criteria to the species. In addition, the characteristics of PSWs differed slightly between locations, potentially because of the geographical separation of populations and habitat differences (e.g. noise levels). The present results confirm the production of stereotyped whistles, including PSWs, by IndoPacific humpback dolphins. Further research should be conducted to confirm whether these whistles are similar to bottlenose dolphins' SWs. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Communication requires both signals and receiver responses, yet we know little about how signals and responses covary when recognition capacity differs across a species' geographical range. Previous work has shown that Polistes fuscatus wasps from Michigan, U.S.A. are capable of individual face recognition, while P. fuscatus from central Pennsylvania, U.S.A. are not. Here, we provide a broader assessment of intraspecific variation in signals and responses across the range of P. fuscatus. We quantify the amount of perceivable facial pattern variation in each population as a measure of individual identity signalling. We also measure how accurately wasps from each population learn to discriminate between a standard set of conspecific faces as a measure of individual face recognition. We show that wasps are equally adept at learning to discriminate faces of wasps from their own population and faces of wasps from different populations, confirming that discriminating a standard set of faces provides a comparable measure of individual face learning capacity. We find that there is striking variation in signals and responses across wasp populations and that individual identity signals and receiver responses are linked. Wasps from populations with more variable individual identity signals learn to discriminate between a standard set of conspecific faces more accurately than wasps from populations with less variable individual identity signals. Overall, we find surprisingly high levels of intraspecific geographical variation in individual identity signals and responses. Work in additional taxa will be important to assess whether signal phenotype and receiver responses are commonly linked in geographically variable communication systems.

AB The formation of subgroups can allow group-living animals flexibility to balance the costs and benefits of sociality over time. Subgrouping dynamics emerge from individual decisions about whether and with whom to maintain cohesion, with these decisions potentially influenced by ecological, physiological and social factors. We GPS-tracked the movements of nearly all members of three wild white-nosed coati, Nasua narica, social groups that differed in their demographic profiles to better understand how these highly social, frugivorous carnivores weight the relative importance of these different factors in their grouping decisions. Quantifying group movements and subgrouping patterns, we found that two of the three groups we tracked exhibited fission-fusion behaviours, with groups splitting into subgroups that persisted over varying time spans from minutes to days. In contrast, the third group remained together across the entire observation period. When groups split, they did not do so randomly; instead, individuals tended to form subgroups with the same individuals consistently over time. Assessing the drivers of subgrouping patterns revealed that subgroup membership was associated with genetic relatedness, but not physiological similarity as quantified by age and sex homophily. Our results demonstrate great variation in subgrouping patterns within a single species, while also highlighting a consistent role of relatedness in driving social preferences when subgroups form.

AB Females' ability to select mates that can fertilize eggs directly impacts their fitness, but the secondary sexual traits that often guide mate choice may not be directly correlated with male fertility. In externally fertilizing species, such as many fish species, chemical cues in ejaculates may allow females to assess male fertilization capacity. However, chemical cues associated with sperm release have only been described in a few species, and evidence that females use these cues to discriminate among males remains limited. Female sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, use several chemical cues to find and interact with potential mates, including a sex pheromone released by males across their gill epithelia and a second sex pheromone released in their semen. Unlike males of many fish species that control pheromone release via urinary pulses, male sea lamprey continually broadcast the gill pheromone once they are sexually mature. This presents a potentially costly scenario for females because attraction to males that are not actively spawning or that are sperm-depleted likely wastes time and energy. We tested the hypothesis that female sea lamprey use pheromones present in seminal plasma to discriminate among potential mates. In-stream behavioural assays revealed that females (1) preferred seminal plasma + male-conditioned water (containing gill-released pheromones) over male-conditioned water alone, (2) preferred male-conditioned water +2x seminal plasma over male-conditioned water + 1x seminal plasma and (3) oriented towards seminal plasma over large distances and when no maleconditioned water was applied. Taken together, our results indicate that female sea lamprey use seminal pheromones to find and remain near males with immediate fertilization capacity, thereby reducing the risk of wasting time and energy during their single, reproductive window. Finally, our study highlights the importance of multiple cues in mate choice. (c) 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The behaviour and welfare of animals in captivity is of great importance to zoological collections, captive breeding programmes, food production and keepers of companion animals. Artificial lighting is commonly deficient in UV wavelengths, and use of such lighting for indoor animal enclosures could have significant impacts on the behaviour and welfare of animals to which UV wavelengths are visible. This includes birds, reptiles and fish, but also insects. Here we investigated the effect of UV-present and UVabsent light environments on the behaviour of Vanessa cardui, a butterfly that possesses a trichromatic visual system typical of many insects. We conducted behavioural experiments using a free-flight arena divided in half, where each half could be subjected to UV+ or UV- illumination. When lighting conditions for the two arena halves were the same, we found no significant differences in activity between UV+ and UV- light environments. However when lighting conditions for the two arena halves were different, butterflies showed a significant preference for the UV+ over the UV- half. This remained the case even when the overall intensity of UV+ illumination was less than that of UV- illumination. Our results suggest that UV-deficient artificial lighting conditions do not themselves affect the activity of butterflies, but that given a choice, butterflies prefer lighting that contains UV. Based on these findings, captive light environments can be designed that use supplementary lighting or filters to improve the welfare of captive insects, and the visitor experience.

AB While the primary goal of avian parental behaviour at the nest revolves around maintaining optimal conditions for embryo development, it frequently exhibits rhythmic patterns influenced by external factors. Along with the more thoroughly examined parameter of incubation temperature, the role of egg turning in shaping embryo development has been comparatively understudied. Moreover, while the majority of studies have been conducted in temperate climates, the dynamics of egg turning in subtropical regions remain largely unexplored. Within this study, we focused on the rhythmic patterns of egg turning in the ground-nesting red-wattled lapwing, Vanellus indicus, inhabiting the hot Arabian desert. Employing an egg logger equipped with an accelerometer and magnetometer, we continuously recorded egg movements throughout various stages of incubation, spanning from the first egg laid to hatching. Our comprehensive analysis unveiled a diurnal rhythmicity of egg turning, using the sum of angular changes per hour, with higher intensity during the day compared to night, and an ultradian rhythm characterized by two prominent peaks occurring around 0700 and 1800 hours. Interestingly, we observed no direct correlation with ambient temperature; however, the rhythmicity of egg turning was affected by predation risk mediated by day-night alternation and nest site selection, with less nocturnal egg turning within less secure mainland nests compared to more secure island nests. We showed that egg turning occurs even before clutch completion and that the sum of angular changes per hour increases throughout the incubation period. As the effect of the incubation stage is inconsistent across studies, it requires further investigation. Although we might expect constant embryonic demands throughout incubation in birds, the parental behaviour associated with egg turning in ground-nesting species in the subtropics is clearly diel rhythmic and shaped by external factors, such as predation risk.

AB Information compression is widely regarded as a fundamental principle that applies to human language. Zipf's law of abbreviation and Menzerath-Altmann's law are two linguistic laws related to information compression and have been demonstrated in human language and other communication systems. Female choice and male-male competition in anurans (frogs and toads) depend heavily on vocal communication. However, it remains unclear whether the laws reflecting information compression apply to vocal communication in anurans. Hainan frilled treefrogs, Kurixalus hainanus, are suitable anuran species to test Zipf's law of abbreviation and Menzerath-Altmann's law as male K. hainanus can emit either monosyllabic or multisyllabic calls with three types of notes (i.e. A, B and C notes). In the present study, we mathematically examined whether the vocalizations of K. hainanus conform to these laws. We found that the note type duration was positively correlated with its frequency of occurrence, which was the opposite finding to that predicted by Zipf's law of abbreviation. We also found that the note duration was negatively correlated with call size (the number of notes in a call), but only A notes exhibited patterns consistent with Menzerath-Altmann's law when analysed separately. These results may be caused by the different physical characteristics or different functions and selection pressures of different note types. Further linear mixed model analysis showed that the duration of A notes was significantly negatively correlated with note position in a call, which suggests that the conformity to Menzerath -Altmann's law in A note is caused by energetic or breathing constraints on vocal production. Lastly, we observed a negative correlation between internote interval duration and call size. Our findings support the existence of information compression in vocal communication systems in anurans, among other communication principles, and contribute to increasing our understanding of universal patterns in communication systems.

AB Female fecundity is dependent on age and mated status. Young female insects accumulate considerable fat stores to fuel energetically expensive ovary development and egg production. Consequently, younger females are expected to have more stored fat than older females while the latter should have larger eggloads than the former. Mating is expected to increase fecundity because male ejaculates contain fecundity-enhancing substances that stimulate egg development, ovulation and oviposition. We experimentally tested the effect of female age (young versus old) and mated status (virgin versus mated) on fat and eggloads in female Gryllus firmus field crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), in addition to testing the prediction that young or mated females have higher resting metabolic rates (RMR) than old or virgin females because the former should be significantly more engaged in the energetically expensive activity of egg production than the latter. As predicted, we found that young females had more fat and fewer eggs than old females and that fat loads negatively correlated with fecundity across all females. Young females also exhibited higher RMR, as expected if egg production is energetically costly. Contrary to expectation, however, mated status had little effect on fat load, egg production or RMR. That mating had little effect on total egg production (i.e. stored and oviposited eggs) challenges the hypothesis that male fecundityenhancing substances in the ejaculate stimulate egg production. Our experiment also permitted us to examine the validity of two popular indices of body condition, the scaled mass index (SMI) and residual body mass (Ri). Neither index accurately represented the true treatment effects of age and mated status on fat load; however, the SMI reflected true fat content in young, but not old, females.

AB How does ecological complexity influence decision making? To facilitate interpretation, laboratory studies often focus on decision tasks with limited options, but animals presumably face more variety in the wild. For example, sometimes species must choose between ephemeral and permanent options, as with choosing between mobile prey and stationary food. The optimal choice is to prioritize the ephemeral option, because it will disappear if not selected first, whereas the permanent option will always be available. In experimental tasks with just these two choices, capuchin monkeys (Sapajus (Cebus) apella) learn to maximize their rewards. However, in the wild, animals presumably face additional sets of choices, for instance two ephemeral or two permanent options, which may make it more difficult to learn the best way to maximize their payouts. Here we show that adding configurations during learning lowers the capuchins' preference for choosing the ephemeral option first. Because recent theoretical work suggests that this more complex version could be solved by grouping the elements through configural learning, half of our subjects underwent training proposed to aid in the configural learning process prior to experiencing the added complexity. This training did not improve the capuchins' ability to pick the ephemeral option first. We consider both what this means for capuchins' and other species' decision making in more complex environments and how we use experimental results to understand animals' cognition and behaviour.

AB Comparative studies of animal communication systems are particularly important for understanding the origins and evolution of core features of human language like syntax and dialects. Recent studies have begun to develop bats as models for investigating shared traits with human language, given the complex social vocalizations of the former. Our previous research revealed that bat social calls contained almost 20 syllable types and the occurrence of these syllable types in the call sequences followed certain permutation rules. However, the differences in these patterns between populations remain unclear. Here, we examined the syntactic patterns of social calls in greater horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, from three geographically distant populations in China. The aggressive calls and behaviours during agonistic interactions of 26 bats were analysed to examine the consistency and variation between two aggression levels and across three populations. Common types of syllables, transitions and sequence patterns were found in all three populations. However, there were significant differences in the occurrence frequencies of shared syllable types, transition types and sequence types. Further, more noisy and composite syllables occurred when aggression was high than when it was low. There were also more transitions between noisy syllables and more repetitions in calls in a high aggression than in a low aggression context. The universal syntactic patterns and differences in social vocalizations of bats across different populations are of interest for fields of animal communication and language evolution.

AB Animal social groups can be organized in hierarchies where individual status determines privileges within the group, and stability is maintained through conflict (aggression-submission) and cooperation. Aggression, submission and cooperation are not homogeneous among group members and are influenced by social context and associated trade-offs. However, studies of rank-specific behaviours are rare which limits our understanding of these patterns. Here, we performed rank ascension experiments using 15 groups of Amphiprion clarkii, a relatively mobile anemonefish, to assess rank-specific behaviour related to social context. We showed that promoted ranks increased cooperation rates compared to nonpromoted ranks to fulfil the tasks associated with their new status within the group. Group size had no effect on cooperation rates, although it did influence rates of submission and neutral interactions, and subordinates did not increase cooperation after group size reduction. Thus, subordinates modulate rates of cooperative behaviour according to their status, irrespective of their body size or group size. We provide evidence that behaviour is plastic and highly influenced by social context, which appears to be the key driver of cooperation and within-group agonistic encounters in this species.

AB Early life events affect the morphology, physiology and quality of individuals, determine their behaviour and personality and influence their response to seasonal changes in daylength. We hypothesized that differences in early life events shape the variability of foraging behaviour and predicted that individuals born early in the breeding season are active and risk prone to ensure current reproductive success, whereas late-born individuals are risk averse to increase their chance of reproducing in the future. To investigate whether time of birth during the year shapes animal behaviour, we used the Siberian hamster, Phodopus sungorus, which is a highly seasonal and polymorphic species. Polymorphism of winter phenotype is observed when individuals from one population respond to a shortening photo-period in different ways. Some individuals change phenotype for winter (responding individuals), while others maintain the summer phenotype throughout the year (nonresponding individuals). We hypoth-esized that polymorphism of winter phenotype and interindividual differences in foraging behaviour are interrelated. Since the responding phenotype is considered to use an energy-conserving strategy, we predicted that shy, less efficient foragers should be more prone to develop the responding phenotype than bold, better foragers. We measured locomotor activity, boldness, giving-up density and food intake in 200 Siberian hamsters born in the first or third litter in a season and postnatally acclimated to a long photoperiod for either 3 or 5 months. We found that hamsters born in the first litters were bolder than their younger siblings, and animals that spent 5 months under a long photoperiod were more active and risk prone than individuals acclimated to long days for 3 months. This variability in behaviour may reflect various strategies that ensure equal fitness of individuals born at different times of the year. Since in-dividual behaviour changed consistently between seasons, we suggest that seasonal changes in behav-iour are a fixed strategy that could be favoured by natural selection. However, these seasonal changes were not related to moulting and torpor use indicating independency of various winter adjustments.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB According to the good genes and genetic compatibility hypotheses, females of socially monogamous species obtain genetic benefits for their offspring by performing extrapair copulations with males of higher quality than their social mates or males with whom they are more genetically compatible. If extrapair offspring do receive genetic benefits in the form of advantageous alleles or more compatible allele combinations, they should outperform their within-pair half-siblings' survival and/or reproductive output. Here, we followed 52 extrapair and 737 within-pair blue-footed booby, Sula nebouxii, offspring during their first 10 years of life (excluding the embryonic period and the first 10 days after hatching) to assess whether they differed in fledging probability, fledgling body condition, recruitment probability, age at first reproduction, number of breeding events or accumulated breeding success. Extrapair and within-pair offspring did not differ in any of these proxies of fitness. Furthermore, we found that extrapair offspring were equally likely to occur in any hatching position. However, differences in fledgling production over the lifetime could not be ruled out, and because only within-pair production of eggs and fledglings was tallied, the possibility remains that extrapair offspring could produce more extrapair offspring later in life than do within-pair offspring. Furthermore, the possibility of context-dependent genetic benefits occurring only under stressful conditions cannot be discounted because our sample of offspring was obtained in a single exceptionally favourable reproductive season.

AB Animals can acquire information through individual learning or by copying others. Simulations suggest that social learning is expected to lead to better rewards, but experimental studies confirming this remain scarce. We tested how a well-known form of social learning in ants, tandem running, affects individual foraging success of Temnothorax nylanderi foragers in controlled laboratory experiments. We manipulated the number and the variability of food sources and assessed the foraging choices of ants searching individually (i.e. scouts) or using social learning (i.e. recruits). We found that social learners indeed discovered better food sources than individual learners, but only in rich environments. However, social learners collected less food than scouts during our trials. Interestingly, individual learners improved their success over time by switching food sources more frequently than social learners. These experimental findings highlight that the relative value of social and individual learning in an ant society depend on the foraging environment and show different temporal dynamics. The ability of individual learners to exploit profitable food sources through a strategy of food source switching, while avoiding the opportunity costs of social learning, can help explain why many social insects, especially those living in small colonies, do not use communication in foraging.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Modifying the relative proportions of macronutrients in an animal's diet has noteworthy effects on its reproduction, lifelong health and life span. Because of this, a wide range of animals carefully regulate their nutrient intake towards species and stage-specific targets. However, when animals are unable to reach their nutrient target from their existing food resources, they will compromise between over-consuming one nutrient and under-consuming the nutrient in deficit. In this study, we used capillary feeding (CAFE) assays to understand the rules of compromise of adult fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, of different sex, mating status and age when constrained to single diets. We found that young male and female D. melanogaster compromised by consuming more food on diets with low protein to carbohydrate (P:C) ratios compared to diets with high P:C ratios. Further, young male and female flies varied their carbohydrate intake significantly more than their protein intake, and female flies varied their carbohy-drate intake significantly more than males. To test for effects of mating status on nutrient intake, we compared food intake of young mated and virgin females. We found that both virgin and mated females compromised by consuming more food on the low P:C diet compared to high P:C diets; however, mated females consumed more food than virgin females. As flies aged, they decreased their overall food intake and showed more modest alterations in their food intake across varying P:C diets. Further, mated females ceased to compromise for the protein deficit at a younger age than males. These findings provide new understanding about differences in protein leveraging behaviour across the sexes, and how these be-haviours change with age.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The song of male birds is implicated in mate attraction and territory defence and assumed to evolve through sexual selection. Song production is hypothesized to represent a biomechanical challenge under physical, respiratory and neural limitation, leading to trade-offs. Although both sexes sing in numerous species, vocal performance has been little studied in females. European robins, Erithacus rubecula, of both sexes sing in autumn and winter to defend exclusive individual territories. We recorded robins singing spontaneously, that is, when not engaged in overt territorial interactions. We identified a trade-off be-tween two acoustic parameters: (1) the frequency ratio between successive song elements and (2) the duration of gaps between these elements. This trade-off might represent a vocal production limit. To compare vocal performance between the sexes we used two measures: vocal gap deviation (the dif-ference between how the bird sings and the theoretical performance maximum according to the putative vocal production limit we had identified) and sound density (the proportion of the song over which sound is present). Males and females did not differ in these two measures of vocal performance sug-gesting that the territory defence function of the song is used in social competition with members of either sex. In both sexes, vocal performance was not correlated with morphometric measures and repeatability coefficients were very small. Thus, vocal performance probably does not convey informa-tion about the signaller's body size or body condition, at least in spontaneous song of robins. These results inform the debate on selection forces driving female song.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Primates of several species respond negatively to receiving less preferred rewards than a partner for completing the same task (inequity responses), either rejecting rewards or refusing to participate in the task when disadvantaged. This has been linked to cooperation, with species that cooperate frequently refusing to participate in inequity tasks (the 'cooperation hypothesis'). However, inequity is a social response, and previous research has involved dyads, precluding studying the effects of additional social partners. While dyads allow for tighter control in experimental settings, dyadic interactions in nature do not take place in a social vacuum, so understanding the role of the social context is needed to verify that the pattern of results supports the cooperation hypothesis. Here we focus on Bolivian squirrel monkeys, Saimiri boliviensis, a highly social species that does not generally cooperate and has not responded to inequity in previous dyadic research, although they do respond to receiving a lower reward than they expected. In the current study, we provide a more nuanced test by studying female Bolivian squirrel monkeys, the demographic most likely to cooperate in both field and laboratory contexts, in a more socially relevant group setting. For some reward values, females responded in both the inequity con-dition, rejecting less preferred rewards when they were disadvantaged relative to their social group, and a contrast condition, wherein all animals received a lower reward than they expected, making it difficult to disentangle contrast from inequity. As in capuchin monkeys, refusals increased when monkeys were to receive low-value rewards compared to medium-value rewards. These results suggest that the rela-tionship between cooperation and inequity responses may be more nuanced than previously suggested, with demographic, social context and reward value potentially influencing outcomes even within species.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals often differ in their responses towards novelty, and sometimes these differences are consistent across individuals. Here, we explored interindividual variation in neophilia towards novel foods by recording whether animals ingested novel food stuffs (N-individuals = 116; N-trials = 276) in three troops of wild vervet monkeys. We tested for the effects of individual level variables, between-individual variation (i.e. personality), within-individual variation (i.e. plasticity) and variation in testing conditions (e.g. ecological conditions, proximate social environment). We found that our animals showed consistent differences towards eating novel foods, with lower-ranking animals displaying a more neophilic response than higher-ranking animals, and that neophilia was socially facilitated. Social facilitation did not depend on whether the partner was foraging, the social association between the focal and their partner or relatedness, indicating that the mere presence of another increased the likelihood that animals would eat the novel food. We also found some evidence that animals responded differentially to variation in their proximate social environment, as some, but not all, animals were more likely to eat the novel food as the number of partners increased, whereas others were not. Our results underscore the importance of testing behaviour and cognition under natural conditions rather than always doing so under strictly controlled settings and controlling for possible confounding factors statistically rather than controlling the testing conditions themselves.

AB Anointing is a behaviour in which animals apply pungent-smelling materials over their bodies. It can be done individually or socially in contact with others. Social anointing can provide coverage of body parts inaccessible to the individual, consistent with hypotheses that propose medicinal benefits. However, in highly social capuchin monkeys, Sapajus and Cebus spp., anointing has been suggested to also benefit group members through 'social bonding'. To test this, we used social network analysis to measure changes in proximity patterns during and shortly after anointing compared to a baseline condition. We presented two capuchin groups with varying quantities of onion, which reliably induces anointing, to create 'rare resource' and 'abundant resource' conditions. We examined the immediate and overall ef-fects of anointing behaviour on the monkeys' social networks, using patterns of proximity as a measure of social bonds. For one group, proximity increased significantly after anointing over baseline values for both rare and abundant resource conditions, but for the other group proximity only increased following the rare resource condition, suggesting a role in mediating social relationships. Social interactions were affected differently in the two groups, reflecting the complex nature of capuchin social organization. Although peripheral males anointed in proximity to other group members, the weak centrality only changed in one group following anointing bouts, indicating variable social responses to anointing. We suggest in part that anointing in capuchins is analogous to social grooming: both behaviours have an antiparasitic function and can be done individually or socially requiring contact between two or more individuals. We propose that they have evolved a social function within complex repertoires of social behaviours. Our alternative perspective avoids treating medicinal and social explanations as alternative hypotheses and, along with increasing support for the medical explanations for anointing, allows us to conceptualize social anointing in capuchins as 'social medication'.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB A fundamental aspect of human communication is our ability to refer to external objects and events through both words and gestures (such as pointing), yet the evolutionary origins of such signals remain obscure. Apes, living in their natural environments, rarely or never point, but it has been claimed that male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, from the Ngogo community, Uganda, habitually use exaggerated loud scratches (ELSs) to refer to specific body locations where they wish to be groomed (Pika & Mitani, 2006, Current Biology, 16(6), 191-192). This study suggested continuity between referential abilities in humans and our closest living relatives, making it an important finding to replicate in other populations. Hence here, we compared whether ELSs are used in a referential manner across four wild communities of eastern chimpanzees (Ngogo, Kanyawara, Sonso and Waibira). Our data show that scratchers were significantly more likely to receive grooming in the scratched location at Ngogo compared to the other three sites. At the latter sites this response occurred at low rates and signallers did not seem to pursue this goal. This suggests that ELSs do not function referentially at these sites, and the published findings from Ngogo were not replicated. Further exploration into alternative functions of ELSs in the Kanyawara community revealed that, in this community, this signal functions to initiate grooming bouts and to reengage partners during grooming pauses. Individuals who produced the signal to initiate grooming were likely to offer grooming. In contrast, during grooming bouts, groomers produced ELSs to request reciprocation of grooming from their partner. Our study demonstrates that chimpanzees do not ubiquitously use the ELS in a referential manner, but that they can use this gesture in a highly flexible fashion, with signal function depending on the intricate details of the social contexts in which they are produced.

AB Humans prey on animals with often dramatic effects on abundances, but also alterations to the phenotypical composition of prey populations. Instances of lethal management provide an opportunity to explore proximate mechanisms of phenotypical change. While there is evidence from exploitative predation (e.g. fisheries) that prey can change via evolutionary mechanisms, we present one of the first studies to explore this effect in an invasive vertebrate species that is being lethally controlled. Using an avian species that is known to be changing its behaviour in areas where it is heavily trapped, this study explored whether trapping of specific behavioural phenotypes might underpin observed changes. The behaviour of common mynas, Acridotheres tristis, captured using a large walk-in baited trap was compared with that of mynas captured using a cryptic whoosh net. All tests revealed significant interindividual variation in ecologically meaningful aspects of myna temperament. Contrary to our predictions, however, we found no evidence that mynas captured in traps were more exploratory, more sociable, less fearful or better problem-solvers than those captured with the cryptic net. We present various interpretations of this finding, including the possibility learning might underpin behavioural changes in free-ranging mynas from heavily trapped populations, complemented by some selection against sociability and low fearfulness. As such, our findings and their interpretation will serve to guide future research on prey responses to human predation and inform animal management practices.

AB Primitively social Sclerodermus parasitoids form female multifoundress groups on large, paralysed hosts and then cooperatively care for large broods of offspring throughout their development. We identified offspring using microsatellite markers and found that nearly every foundress produced offspring, implying that overall reproductive skew was not extreme. We expected that kinship may influence skew if, for instance, relatives within a group collectively suppress the reproduction of a nonrelative or if nonrelatives selfishly overexploit group reproductive optima. We found slight skew, in favour of the nonsibling, when two full-sibling foundresses brooded with one nonsibling foundress but no skew when three sibs brooded with one nonsibling. All foundresses made similar contributions to the sexual composition of broods, which were highly female biased. We expected body size differences might promote skew via physical domination of some foundresses by others or via intrinsically differential fecundity. We found heterogeneity in the relative contributions of dissimilar-sized foundresses but no skew overall. Nevertheless, males within these broods were more often the progeny of the largest foundress, suggesting that larger females are able to dominate the production, or the survival, of males. We expected that temporal priority may generate skew via early individuals having a longer period in which to reproduce and/or become dominant. We found that the skew indeed favoured foundresses that had started to reproduce before a second foundress was introduced. Further, if eggs laid by a first foundress had started to hatch before a second foundress was introduced, the second foundress produced female offspring only. Overall, we found that skew is not strongly associated with kinship among foundresses but does appear to be associated with intrinsic or acquired dominance and that where skew is manifest it can comprise brood sex ratio effects as well as overall reproduction effects.

AB Large animal species are most likely to survive human-induced rapid environmental change if they display high levels of behavioural flexibility. Examining social responses in species that form closely bonded social groups and display high fission-fusion dynamics, such as chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, will help determine their resilience to dynamic human activities and the potential for sustainable human-wildlife interactions. Coinciding with the seasonal availability of cultivated jackfruit, Artocarpus heterophyllus, a dominant food available in croplands and village gardens, we examined the social adjustments of wild chimpanzees to risks presented by a human-modified landscape at Bulindi, Uganda. Absolute party size decreased when chimpanzees moved from low-risk 'natural' habitat (forest fragments) to high-risk 'anthropogenic' habitat (croplands and other village areas), driven mainly by parties containing fewer females. Using social network analysis, we found that chimpanzee social structure showed partial flexibility in response to anthropogenic risk. The strength of social ties in a 5 m proximity network stayed similar and individual centrality measures were correlated between low-and high-risk habitats. Nevertheless, in high-risk habitat males were more central than females and exclusively dominated the core of the network's core-periphery structure. However, sex differences were not apparent when we corrected for party membership, indicating that differences were driven by changes to party membership between habitat types rather than changes in social proximity within parties. We suggest that perception of anthropogenic risk can drive continual adjustments to grouping dynamics in response to changing conditions that modify social lives of male and female chimpanzees in different ways. Consequently, changes in grouping patterns induced by continuing anthropogenic change could impact ecological and evolutionary processes influenced by social structure, including cultural evolution and the spread of infectious disease.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals are increasingly exposed to thermal and chemical stressors across spatially heterogeneous landscapes, and adaptive reproductive decisions may mitigate the effects of multiple stressors. Yet, the combined effects of temperature and glyphosate (a broad-spectrum herbicide that is potentially the most commonly used pesticide worldwide) on maternal decision making and terrestrial embryos are unknown. Here, we integrate the effects of temperature, glyphosate (alone and in its commercial formulation, Roundup (R)) and spatial heterogeneity on oviposition (egg-laying) behaviour, which affects the fitness of females and their offspring. We used the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, to test several hypotheses explaining oviposition site selection, specifically the roles of embryo survival, offspring phenotype and maternal survival in oviposition decisions. Temperature (but not glyphosate) affected oviposition and offspring success, with higher performance at intermediate temperatures and lower performance at the extremes, and oviposition increased with the availability of oviposition sites, particularly at warmer temperatures. Environmental context influenced support for oviposition site selection hypotheses. For example, spatial bet hedging (putatively related to maternal survival) was temperature sensitive and it modulated support for the 'offspring phenotype' and 'embryo survival' hypotheses. Specifically, an increased availability of oviposition sites prompted females to oviposit at warmer temperatures, thereby favouring offspring phenotype (increased developmental rate) at an expense to embryo survival (reduced hatching success). In summary, the interconnectedness of spatial and thermal heterogeneity (but not a common pesticide) played large roles in decision making that affects transgenerational fitness.

ID WAGGLE DANCE; FORAGERS; INFORMATION; COLONIES
AB Honey bees famously use waggle dances to communicate foraging locations to nestmates in the hive, thereby recruiting them to those sites. The decision to dance is governed by rules that, when operating collectively, are assumed to direct foragers to the most profitable locations with little input from potential recruits, who are presumed to respond similarly to any dance regardless of its information content. Yet, variation in receiver responses can qualitatively alter collective outcomes. Here, we use network-based diffusion analysis to compare the collective influence of dance information during recruitment to feeders at different distances. We further assess how any such effects might be achieved at the individual level by dance followers either persisting with known sites when novel targets are distant and/or seeking more accurate spatial information to guide long-distance searches. Contrary to predictions, we found little evidence that dance followers' responses depended on target distance over the foraging distances considered here (100-500 m). While dance information was always key to feeder discovery, its importance did not vary with feeder distance, and bees were in fact quicker to abandon previously rewarding sites for distant alternatives. These findings provide empirical support for the longstanding assumption that self-organized foraging by honey bee colonies relies heavily on signal performance rules with limited input from recipients.(c) 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Dominance hierarchies are known to reduce agonistic interactions between individuals and may be influenced by differences in phenotypes such as body size, personality or cognition. Colour ornamentation, especially with melanin-based colours, can also be a badge of status signalling social dominance, but status signalling with carotenoid-based colours is little understood. Here we studied whether different phenotypes, including individual differences in carotenoid-based colour ornamentation, body size, personality-, cognition- and stress-related traits, predict social dominance in the highly social and mutually ornamented common waxbill, Estrilda astrild. We monitored aggressive interactions of waxbills living in seminatural conditions, in a large mesocosm, using data from a radiofrequency identification system in the nonbreeding and breeding seasons over 2 consecutive years. We found the position of individual waxbills in the dominance hierarchy repeatable across seasons and years. Furthermore, the steepness of the dominance hierarchy was greater in the breeding seasons, perhaps because of increased competition over mates or breeding resources. Contrary to previous work with waxbills in birdcages, here body size did not predict social dominance, perhaps because in our more natural setting aggressive encounters were mostly airborne, where large body size may not confer a fighting advantage and may even reduce manoeuvrability. Sex, reactive-to-proactive personality differences and traits related to cognition or stress did not predict social dominance either. Finally, red colour saturation, but not the size of the red patch, strongly predicted social dominance and may thus act as a badge of status. This is one of the few studies testing whether size or saturation of carotenoid-based plumage coloration indicates social dominance and suggests that saturation may more often signal dominance.

AB Habitat disturbance can promote the invasion success of alien species, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, especially in animal species. Alien species may have trait values that facilitate invasion (ideal weed hypothesis) or greater phenotypic plasticity than native species (plasticity hypothesis), thus promoting their invasion success in disturbed habitats. Invasion success and ultimately alien species dominance in disturbed habitats can also be a direct consequence of competitive exclusion of native species. We performed experiments in controlled conditions to determine which of these mechanisms could explain the invasion success of Arion subfuscus s.l. (hereafter Arion), an alien slug species complex that lives in various disturbed ecosystems of eastern Canada such as managed forests. To do so, we compared the behavioural response of Arion and native sympatric philomycid slugs (hereafter Philomycus) to a decrease in soil moisture content, which often occurs after forest harvesting (i.e. habitat disturbance). We also investigated whether the presence of Arion alters the behaviour of Philomycus, which would indicate that Arion has a greater ability to compete by interference than these native species. Our findings show that Arion did not have higher boldness or locomotor activity (i.e. behaviours that promote invasion success) or greater plasticity than Philomycus, and that the presence of Arion did not affect the behaviour of Philomycus. However, Arion may be able to exploit resources more efficiently than native species since it mainly used the closest refuge from the food source in the present study. These findings are in line with the ideal weed hypothesis but do not support the phenotypic plasticity hypothesis or any role of interference competition in Arion invasion success in disturbed habitats such as harvested forests. Our results also suggest that the direction, but not the magnitude, of behavioural plasticity might be a key aspect in alien species invasion success in disturbed habitats.

AB Both abiotic environmental conditions and variation in social environment are known to impact the acquisition of sexual signals. However, the influences of abiotic environmental and social factors are rarely compared to each other. Here we test the relative importance of these factors in determining whether and when male red-backed fairy-wrens, Malurus melanocephalus, moult into ornamented breeding plumage, a known sexual signal. One-year-old male red-backed fairy-wrens vary in whether or not they acquire ornamentation, whereas males age 2 years and older vary in their timing of ornament acquisition. It is unclear whether these processes are determined by the same or different factors, and we examined both events using a combination of long-term breeding records and nonbreeding social networks. We found that 1-year-old males that paired prior to the start of the breeding season were more likely to acquire ornamented plumage, but rainfall did not influence whether 1-year-old males acquired ornamented plumage. Thus, for young individuals, social cues appear to play a larger role than abiotic environmental factors in determining ornament acquisition. For older males, timing of ornamented plumage acquisition was constrained by rainfall, with drier nonbreeding seasons leading to poorer physiological condition and later moult dates. Thus, sexual signal variation in older males appears to be a condition-dependent trait, driven by abiotic environmental and physiological factors rather than social cues. These findings reveal that factors influencing sexual signal expression can vary with age when age classes exhibit different forms of signal variation. Our results suggest that social environment may drive sexual signal variation in young individuals, whereas abiotic environmental variation may drive sexual signal variation in older individuals.

AB In many bird species, reproductive partners sing together each time they meet on the nest. Because these nest ceremonies typically correspond to the return of one partner from foraging and to the subsequent departure of the other partner, we hypothesized that the foraging decisions of departing birds may be facilitated by the vocalizations accompanying their partner's return on the nest, providing these vocalizations reflect foraging conditions. We examined this hypothesis in pairs of Adelie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, by longitudinally monitoring their nest vocalizations and their spatial distribution when foraging at sea across the guard stage, when both parents regularly alternate foraging at sea and chick attendance at the nest. We found that the acoustic characteristics of the vocalizations produced during nest relief ceremonies reflected some characteristics of the foraging trips of both the returning and departing partners. However, these acoustic characteristics differed between partners and were differently related to their foraging behaviour. Accordingly, departing individuals did not adopt the same foraging behaviour as that of returning individuals. Nest vocalizations therefore do not appear to represent cues facilitating the foraging decisions of departing birds, but they may rather reflect the arousal of partners, which differently correlates with the foraging behaviour of the returning and departing individuals. Our study highlights an interplay between the vocalizations produced on the nest by reproductive partners and their foraging behaviour, thereby broadening the scope of animal vocalizations and opening a novel perspective on the regulation of foraging strategies. However, our exploratory study also highlights the complexity of examining this interplay, as the effects of nest vocalizations on foraging decisions may be complicated by other factors (e.g. intrinsic foraging capacity). This calls for the use of additional and experimental approaches (e.g. vocalization playbacks) to clarify the role of nest vocalizations as potential mediators of foraging decisions.

AB Domestic fowl have been demonstrated to individually differ in personality, dictating reactions to environmental stimuli. Free-range chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, show individual range use varia-tion, which may be related to personality differences. Enrichment can also modify behavioural traits. This study measured behavioural impacts of rearing enrichments across pullets and young adults, testing for personality differences and whether they predicted range use variation. Laying hens were reared for 16 weeks across nine pens under three conditions comparing control floor litter rearing with two enrich-ment types (novel objects or perching structures). At 16 weeks of age, 1386 pullets were transferred to a laying facility, housed in nine identical pens and given range access at 25 weeks. A sample of birds were tested at 9-11 weeks and 20-21 weeks with a series of tests: novel arena, adaptation to the arena with food present, open field, novel maze arena training with food and maze tests. Individual range use from 27 to 31 weeks was measured via radiofrequency identification technology. Enriched pullets were significantly quicker to first step in the adaptation with food present and structurally reared hens were significantly quicker to first step in the open field during testing, but there were no significant differences observed during maze arena training and testing. Of 16 correlations among test parameters, 11 were significant for control birds and six to seven were significant for the enriched treatments. Test parameter and range use correlations were significant for the control birds only. These results support the presence of different personalities in hens with enrichment reducing fear and increasing adaptation. Fewer cor-relations in the enriched hens suggest they developed a more plastic personality type. This response strategy may have fitness benefits for free-range birds or other captive-reared animals that undergo drastic environmental change across their lifetime. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB Animals with small nervous systems may be prone to limitations in processing ability when confronted with a diversity of stimuli, especially if these involve multiple sensory modalities. We investigated the effect of the odour of the plant Lantana camara and its dominant volatile compound, b-caryophyllene, on the prey choice decisions of Evarcha culicivora, a jumping spider (Salticidae) that frequently visits L. camara as a site to mate and to obtain nectar. Evarcha culicivora expresses a strong preference for blood-fed female Anopheles mosquitoes as prey. We tested juvenile and adult E. culicivora in experiments involving live prey, lures made from dead prey and virtual prey, when presented with no odour, odour from L. camara and b-caryophyllene. We found that, in the presence of the plant-related odours, E. culicivora's prey preference was no longer expressed. This effect seems to be a consequence of the plant-related odours reducing the extent to which E. culicivora relies on a pre-attack pause and visual fixation routine ('stationing') when seeing prey. Stationing may be critical for adequate visual scanning, and thus correct identification of the prey, as we found that the longer the spider was stationed in front of prey before being subjected to a disruption, the more strongly E. culicivora expressed a preference for blood-fed female mosquitoes. This seems to be an unusual example of a specific modulation of visually based prey choice behaviour being mediated by an environmental chemical cue not pertinent to the prey.

AB Gathering information from the environment allows animals to make informed behavioural decisions, with individuals sampling information either privately or via social cues from group members. Environmental noise, however, may disrupt the ability of animals to gather information in their environment. Therefore, social interactions could be disrupted by environmental noise, or adapted to mitigate the costs associated with compromised perception in noisy environments. Here we tested whether the presence of water caustics, a natural form of visual noise prevalent within shallow aquatic habitats, affects the social decisions of shoaling fish. In a classic experimental paradigm, individual three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, were given a choice between two conspecific shoals differing in size while immersed in different levels of visual noise. Fish showed greater social attraction towards conspecifics as noise levels increased, measured by a reduction in the distance they maintained from others. While sticklebacks only showed clear preferences for groups that had at least four more members than another group, there was no evidence that visual noise level influenced fish's preference to associate with these larger shoals, nor did it change the preferences for other shoal sizes. Our findings suggest that, at the group sizes tested, visual noise increases individual stickleback's social attraction towards conspecifics, but does not affect their decision to associate with the larger of two groups. Such changes to social behaviour may reflect the consequences of having a reduced ability to sample private, but not social, information in noisy environments. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB Human infants but not adults possess the ability to perceive differences between non-native language phoneme categories. The predominant explanation for this age-related decline in discriminative ability is the effect of statistical learning driven by sensory exposure: phoneme categories of the native language take precedence, have a higher frequency of occurrence and may encompass category distinctions in non-native languages. Alternatively, one could explain the decline through a reduction in discriminative abilities attributable to ageing. Thus, to what extent is auditory perception influenced either by expe-rience or by age-related processes? Here, we attempted to answer this question, which cannot easily be disentangled in humans, in songbirds, which share many properties with humans: both learn the sta-tistical distribution of sounds in their environment, both possess neural circuits to process vocalizations of their own species and plasticity in these circuits is subject to critical periods. To study the effects of experience and ageing, we trained zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, to discriminate short from long versions of a single zebra finch song syllable type. Birds in four groups distinguished by their age (old versus young) and level of auditory experience (with song experience versus completely isolated from song) could learn to discriminate arbitrarily fine differences between song syllables, although we found a trend that upholds the statistical learning hypothesis: birds with song experience performed better than birds with no experience. Furthermore, birds in all groups were able to generalize their learning to new stimuli of the same type, and they were able to rapidly adapt their learned discrimination boundaries. Finally, we found that songbirds could accurately discriminate randomly selected renditions of a ste-reotyped adult song syllable, revealing a flexible ability to discriminate conspecific vocalizations. ? 2021 The Authors.

AB Behavioural lateralization is a widespread phenomenon in the animal kingdom and can be an indicator of brain asymmetries in structure or function. It is often assessed using only one measure within the same study. Additionally, this measure is usually obtained in artificial situations, where the subjects undergo tasks requiring learning and forced performance of a specific action. Combining different measures of lateralization seems to be particularly promising, as artificially tested and spontaneously displayed behaviours may cover different aspects of behavioural lateralization. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to provide a comprehensive characterization of behavioural lateralization, using the laboratory mouse, Mus musculus f. domestica, as a model system. We examined lateralization using four behavioural measures, namely food reaching in an artificial test situation (the reference, most established, test) and three spontaneous behaviours (grid climbing, self-grooming and barrier crossing). We investigated their temporal consistency, assessed the association of the three spontaneous behaviours with the established food-reaching test and explored possible influences of genetic background and sex. We found differences in the distributions of lateralization across these behaviours, with fewer mice showing laterality in spontaneous behaviours. All behaviours showed high temporal consistency for the direction of laterality, while only food reaching did so for the strength of laterality. Furthermore, laterality of the spontaneous behaviours was unrelated to laterality of the food-reaching test. Lastly, strain affected behavioural lateralization, with C57BL/6J mice being more strongly lateralized than CD-1 mice for some behaviours, while sex did not affect it. Therefore, we conclude that behavioural lateralization is affected not only by genetic background, but also by the complexity of a given task. To obtain a comprehensive picture of behavioural lateralization, several measures from different contexts thus need to be included in a single study. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Courtship displays are typically conspicuous, elaborate and composed of concomitant signals occurring in different sensory modalities. Although multimodal signals have received increasing attention over the past years, technical issues, in particular the lack of appropriate recording and analytical methods, have long restricted large-scale systematic study of their function. Here, we investigated in detail in 100 male-female dyads whether the multimodal, audiovisual courtship signals of the male ring dove, Streptopelia risoria, are associated with different immediate behavioural responses by the female, and whether such responses depend on the courting individual. We used synchronized high-speed video and audio recordings followed by semiautomatic image- and audio-processing techniques to precisely quantify variation in male courtship and female response. In particular, we investigated the structure of acoustic and visual courtship components, as well as aspects related to multimodal synchronization. We found that the fundamental frequency of male calls, as well as the total courtship duration and the duration of courtship bouts, influenced female tail-quivering behaviour, confirming that this behaviour is a sign of sexual interest in doves. On the other hand, some courtship variables frequently investigated in the literature, such as courtship rate, did not affect any aspect of female response. Additionally, we demonstrated an effect of repeated encounters with an individual of the opposite sex both on male courtship variables and on female sexual response to courtship. Females also responded differently to different males, that is, we found variation in female behavioural response to courtship variables related to identity and courtship effort. Further empirical studies are needed to assess how different male courtship elements influence female behaviour and ultimate mating decisions. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB Animals often rely on different sources of information when making decisions about the environment. Here, we assessed whether two jumping spiders (Salticidae), Trite planiceps and Portia fimbriata, take two different sources of information into account when jumping over water, to which they are averse. Specifically, we investigated whether salticids can assess both mechanical (wind) and visual cues (distance) while jumping from one platform within a pool arena to another. In the first experiment, salticids were exposed to either no wind, low wind speed or high wind speed. Spiders adjusted the horizontal direction of the jump depending on wind presence, such that the wind would favour the jump. Furthermore, independent of wind presence, the vertical trajectory of the jump affected jump outcome (success or failure) in Portia, but not in Trite. In a second experiment, salticids were exposed to intermittent wind in 10 s bouts to assess whether they preferred to jump during bouts without wind. As expected, spiders preferred to jump when there was no wind. Overall, we found that salticids do account for wind conditions when initiating a potentially risky jump, but that sound also affects salticid behaviour before the jump, possibly due to stress.

AB Mobbing, a collective harassment of a predator by multiple prey species, is ubiquitous in animals. In birds, it is often prompted by specific vocalizations (mobbing calls) produced by an individual that detects a predator; this attracts nearby conspecifics and heterospecifics in a joint assault on the predator. Mutual recognition of mobbing calls among heterospecifics, even those distantly related, is widespread in birds and learning appears important for its acquisition and maintenance. Yet, the evidence for learned recognition is mostly indirect and the specific learning mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, I provide experimental evidence that free-living birds (wood warblers, Phylloscopus sibilatrix) can learn to recognize novel heterospecific mobbing calls through interspecific social learning, by associating mobbing calls of a previously unknown species with those of the already recognized heterospecifics during joint mobbing events. Moreover, individuals retained the learned recognition of novel mobbing calls over at least 2 weeks. These results illustrate interspecific social learning as one of the mechanisms underlying the widespread mutual recognition of mobbing calls among bird species. This mechanism of learning is likely to be common in the wild, enabling naive individuals to utilize a wide set of possible information sources, and result in a rapid cultural transmission of novel antipredator signal recognition within avian communities.(C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The importance of vision-reliant defensive traits (e.g. warning colours) in mimicry studies is well established, but their effectiveness is limited by visibility. In low light conditions, for instance, acoustic or tactile channels may be more effective. The juvenile and adult stages of the nocturnal hunting Palpimanus spiders audibly stridulate when harassed. Given this we hypothesized that the sound produced by Palpimanus has a defensive role against interspecific predators. Palpimanus though are poorly defended especially against something as large as a gecko. Hence we hypothesized that the stridulation is effective because the spider mimics co-occurring mutillid wasps. We staged predator feeding experiments in which mutillid wasps, sham-operated Palpimanus, silenced Palpimanus and a nonstridulating spider were offered to Eusparassus spiders and geckoes. Stridulating spiders had significantly greater survival against both predators than the nonstridulating treatments and comparable survival to the mutillid wasps. This result represents the first confirmed case of a spider using stridulation against an interspecific predator. Stridulation deterred Eusparasus spiders, while in geckoes stridulation acted postcapture as they dropped the prey instead of attempting to swallow them. For mutillid wasps this dropping response was typically more rapid than with Palpimanus but attempts to swallow silenced individuals were more frequent than sham-operated individuals, which were more likely to be dropped before any attempt to swallow. Analyses of stridulation characteristics of Palpimanus showed they were similar to acoustic signals of four of the co-occurring mutillid wasps and far more so than distress signals of control insects. Our study overall supports the notion that Palpimanus spiders are Batesian mimics of sympatrically occurring mutillids through the use of an aposematic acoustic signal and not just an example of a startle response.

AB Like birds and many other animals, bats produce diverse acoustic calls for social communication. Geographical variation in social acoustic signals and perceptual discrimination abilities are well studied in birds but largely unexplored in bats. In this study, we recorded male territorial calls of the great Himalayan leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros armiger, from nine colonies at a large geographical scale and investigated the patterns and causes of geographical variation in acoustic signals. We also performed habituation-dishabituation playbacks to investigate whether males could discriminate between territorial calls of their own versus a foreign colony. Overall, our results showed significant geographical variation in calls across colonies. Neither climatic differences, morphological differences, geographical distances nor genetic distances between colonies explained the observed acoustic variation between colonies. A playback experiment indicated that males from eastern China were able to discriminate between calls of males from their own colony and those of males from a colony in southwestern China. This study provides the first experimental evidence that bats can discriminate geographical variation in social calls. (C) 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In mammals, allogrooming is prominent in forming and maintaining social and cooperative relationships. Yet an animal's social time is constrained, which may limit its access to a large number of partners. Dunbar (1993, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 16 (4), 681-694) proposed that human polyadic conversations, which allow access to several social partners simultaneously, evolved as a form of social grooming to circumvent this time constraint. In nonhuman primates, polyadic grooming (PG), in contrast to dyadic grooming, may similarly be a time-efficient way to maintain weak social relationships with many partners which can be important for group level cooperation. It remains unknown whether PG is used to fulfil specific cooperative needs by accessing numerous weakly bonded partners and increasing the number of partners accessed per unit of time. We compared the use and effect of PG between chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, which are highly territorial and collaborative (especially males), and bonobos, Pan paniscus, which are less territorial and collaborative and in which females are the main cooperators. We carried out focal grooming observations in one bonobo and two chimpanzee communities in the wild. As predicted, chimpanzees engaged in more PG than bonobos. Surprisingly, males engaged in PG more than females in both species. While chimpanzees accessed more partners per minute of grooming than bonobos via dyadic grooming, PG increased the number of partners accessed per minute only in bonobos. Finally, chimpanzees primarily used PG with individuals who were close in rank and frequent grooming partners, whereas bonobos used PG with individuals who were distant in rank, close party associates and frequent grooming partners. We suggest that bonobo males use PG to enhance conspecific social tolerance and mate choice. The overall higher rate of PG in chimpanzees suggests that between-group competition may promote polyadic affiliation, which possibly reinforces group cohesion and coordination. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB In bumblebees, dominance behaviour contributes to the regulation of the reproductive division of labour between queens and workers. Towards the end of the colony cycle, at the onset of the competition phase, reproductive workers will establish a dominance hierarchy and challenge the reproductive monopoly of the queen by laying unfertilized, male-destined eggs. However, it has been suggested that the dominance and reproductive hierarchies in bumblebee workers are not completely aligned. By performing manipulative experiments and observing both aggressive behaviour and ovarian activation in Bombus terrestris workers, we aimed to elucidate how these two hierarchies interact and are modulated by the presence of the queen and other reproductive workers. We found that the reintroduction of a queen in a queenless colony not only caused worker ovary regression, but also decreased aggressive interactions between workers, thereby restoring the harmony in the colony. Furthermore, transplanting dominant reproductive workers from queenless colonies into queenright colonies induced the resident workers to activate their ovaries and aggressively compete over reproduction, thereby implying that positive feedback drives the onset of the competition phase. However, we did not see this result when subordinate reproductive workers from queenless colonies were added to queenright colonies, suggesting that ovary activation is mainly initiated in reaction to displays of dominance. Additionally, we observed that workers were attacked irrespective of their reproductive state, questioning the importance of signals that advertise either fertility or sterility in bumblebees. Finally, larger workers were significantly more aggressive and significantly more likely to be attacked, even though smaller workers were equally likely to have activated ovaries. This suggests that large workers resort to aggression to increase their chances of successfully reproducing due to their inherent fighting advantage, whereas small cheater workers could possibly reproduce by staying under the radar to evade nestmate aggression.

AB Quantifying transgenerational effects of stress is important to predict outcomes of anthropogenic disturbances for wildlife species. Maternal stress can programme physiological and behavioural phenotypes in offspring, which may be maladaptive if maternal and offspring environments are mismatched. We investigated effects of a match and mismatch between egg cortisol and offspring stress levels in lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, using artificially elevated egg cortisol levels (simulating maternal stress) and a chronic unpredictable stress regime for offspring after hatch. Offspring cortisol levels were quantified at baseline and after an acute stressor. Multiple measures of offspring swimming activity were assessed in behaviour trials. Individuals that experienced elevated egg cortisol and high offspring stress exhibited a diminished cortisol response to an acute stressor, but responses varied among offspring from different families. Results suggest that the interaction between maternal and offspring experience may cue an offspring phenotype that is adaptive in high-stress conditions. Principal components analysis characterizing interindividual variation in offspring behavioural variables showed that treatment significantly affected multivariate offspring response along the PC1 axis (associated with inactivity), and both treatment and family significantly affected response along the PC2 axis (associated with shorter distance moved). The largest differences for PC1 occurred between the 'mismatch' treatments (high egg cortisol and low offspring stress exhibiting lower activity; low egg cortisol and high offspring stress exhibiting higher activity), indicating that the combination of egg cortisol and offspring stress is more important in determining offspring behaviour than is egg cortisol or offspring stress alone. Findings suggest that family effects, such as genetic components or maternal experience, may mediate how the interaction of maternal and offspring stress influences offspring physiological and behavioural outcomes, and indicate the need for further research into environmental factors experienced by females that influence how offspring respond to egg cortisol and early life stress.

AB Group-living animals can affect each other's behaviour, causing changes in the rate or type of behaviours performed (social facilitation), or convergence in behaviour to that displayed by the majority of neighbours (social conformity). Facilitation and conformity effects can act to reduce direct competition and/or enable social coordination, and the degree to which individuals can affect each other's behaviour can depend upon the identities and traits of those interacting. To investigate the effect of social partners on individual behaviour, we studied the activity of Java sparrows, Lonchura oryzivora, in three contexts (alone, in the presence of three males or in the presence of three females) and in two conditions (novel environment and novel object tests). A significant proportion of variation in bird activity across trials was attributed to variation among individuals, indicating a personality trait. However, activity varied systematically according to whether birds were tested alone or in the presence of companions. We found that irrespective of the focal bird's sex, individuals were more active in a social context than when alone, and this effect was greatest when focal birds were in the presence of male companions. Overall, our findings demonstrate facilitative effects of social partners on Java sparrow activity, and the magnitude of this effect depended on the sex of the companions. These results therefore support the hypothesis that social isolation causes behavioural inhibition (which may be caused by increased perception of risk), and future studies should carefully assess the need to consider the social context when studying personality and its ecological and evolutionary processes across different species and contexts.

AB Polyandry has been a central topic in the study of animal behaviour. Yet, it is still not clear how the body weight of each sex affects the probability of female remating, and what each sex gains from polyandry. Here we aimed to shed some light on these questions using the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). We found that virgin pairs mated regardless of their weight to ensure fertilization. However, only 58% of once-mated females remated. The probability of female remating increased when the female and/or the second male was heavier. Our findings indicate that fecundity, polygamy and longevity are functions of body weight in each sex. The nature of the last male sperm precedence in this species allows males and nonvirgin females to regulate their mating decisions. We propose that once-mated females would benefit from accepting heavier second males to replace most sperm from the lighter first mates and rejecting lighter second males to avoid displacement of sperm from the first heavier mates. Heavier males are more coercive, probably also preferred by females, and thus more likely to achieve mating with heavier nonvirgin females to replace most sperm from the previous males and dominate paternity. As body weight is heritable, we suggest that the fitness of both sexes rises when they pass on genes for this trait through female encouragement or avoidance of sperm displacement and male coercion of mated females into remating. We conclude that the two sexes play interactive roles in determining polyandrous patterns depending on their body weight. (C) 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB For developing organisms, early environmental conditions are critical as they provide cues about their environment and are thus helpful to make decisions for the short and long term. As such, the early environment is known to affect several phenotypic traits, and these can persist after developmental growth. However, the role of these early environmental conditions in shaping personality traits remains largely unknown. Here, we used a reciprocal transplant experiment to explore the effect of landscape of origin versus landscape of development on boldness and activity in a butterfly, Pararge aegeria. Larvae of woodland, agricultural and urban population origins were reared in situ in their landscape of origin or under the two alternative environmental conditions. We then repeatedly quantified boldness and activity in the Fl adults under laboratory conditions. While the landscape of development appeared to have no effect on mean trait values, it affected trait repeatability through changes in among-individual variation. Additionally, males of agricultural origin had higher mean boldness scores than woodland and urban origin males. Also, average boldness declined with testing sequence in individuals of woodland origin, but not in agricultural and urban origin individuals. Overall, our results suggest that (1) conspecifics originating from distinct habitat types differ in some aspects of boldness, and (2) early developmental conditions can affect behavioural consistency without changing mean behavioural phenotypes.

AB Male preference for high-quality females is expected to evolve when male reproductive potential is restricted. However, when there is competition among males, some models predict the evolution of assortative male mate choice, in which good competitors choose high-quality females while poor competitors choose lower quality females to avoid competition. In Trichonephila clavipes spiders, males have limited sperm supply and fight for access to females. We tested whether female quality and male size (a proxy of fighting ability) influence male decisions in T. clavipes. We used field experiments in which males could choose between two available females in a scenario free of competition. We found that males choose their mates based on both female size and female recent pairing status (whether the female was accompanied by a male before the experiment). Importantly, male mate choice was plastic, and varied with male size, as large males preferred larger females that were recently unpaired, medium-sized males showed no preference and small males preferred smaller, recently paired females. Because all females appear to attract males, we predict that variation in male mate choice attenuates sexual selection on females. Our findings confirm the prediction of variable male mate choice when there is male-male competition and male reproductive potential is restricted, a pattern that may be common, but hard to detect.

AB Because the costs and benefits of living in a group change according to ontogenetic stage, variation in body size is predicted to cause differences in social preferences even within individuals. Based on the fitness consequences of group living, small individuals in early developmental stages are predicted to form aggregations to reduce predation risk, whereas large individuals will avoid one another to reduce resource competition. Furthermore, when individuals recognize kin, social preferences may vary depending on the kinship relationship between them. In this study, we examined the association preference of different-sized Rana ornativentris tadpoles, that is, small individuals in early developmental stages and larger tadpoles at later developmental stages. Our binary choice experiments showed that, regardless of size, R. ornativentris tadpoles can discriminate between conspecifics based on both phenotype and relatedness. That is, association preferences were determined by the size and relatedness of the subject and the two stimulus tadpoles. Both small and large individuals spent longer with small than large tadpoles. However, there was a significant difference in preference between small and large tadpoles. When one of the two stimulus tadpoles was a large nonsibling, small tadpoles tended to associate with both small siblings and small nonsiblings. In contrast, large tadpoles showed no preference for small siblings. In the context of the benefits of grouping, phenotype matching would be effective only in small tadpoles. Conversely, under the pressure of conspecific competition, large tadpoles did not prefer to associate with similar-sized ones; this may have enabled large tadpoles to avoid competing with kin and to reduce the costs of group living.

AB Brood and social parasites exploit the parental care of their host and often integrate into host colonies using different strategies at different moments during their life cycle. In social wasps, the obligate social parasite Polistes atrimandibularis, using chemical mimicry and chemical insignificance, avoids detection by its host, Polistes biglumis, which has an efficient nestmate recognition system. Enslaved host foundresses accept and care for parasite brood as if it were their own. This observation raises the following question: how exactly do parasite brood escape detection and increase host acceptance ? Here, we compared the cuticular chemical signatures of parasite brood and host brood. Their signatures differed in composition: parasite larvae and pupae had particularly high levels of alkenes (notably 9-nonacosene), which were absent in host larvae and pupae. Given this result, we tested the effect of 9-nonacosene on host foundresses, and documented that they reduced their aggression. Our findings address a novel integration strategy for social parasite brood as they suggest that the hydrocarbon serves as an appeasement substance and promotes host tolerance of parasite larvae and pupae, which are chemically disparate from host larvae and pupae.

AB A growing body of evidence suggests that birds can use olfactory cues to detect the presence of predators. We predicted that the ability to gather information about predator presence through chemical cues might be particularly important for ground-living and foraging bird species, since their main predators, namely mammals and reptiles, use chemical communication. In this context, we experimentally examined the role of olfaction in the nondomesticated, ground-living red-legged partridge, Alectoris rufa, in a natural and context-dependent situation. We tested how individuals responded to three different olfactory stimuli, which were presented in sand bath tubs: (1) a mammalian predator (ferret faeces), (2) an avian alarm scent (alarm secretion of the European hoopoe) and (3) a control (orange oil). As dependent variables we recorded side preferences and dustbathing activity. Red-legged partridges avoided the predator scent to the same extent as the alarm scent of the hoopoe, whereas orange oil scent did not affect side choice or dustbathing behaviour of individuals. Our results indicate that red-legged partridges avoid the scent of a predator as well as the alarm scent of an avian heterospecific. In regard to this, we provide the first indication that, in risk assessment, chemical cues, similar to avian alarm calls, may possibly act as a source of information between avian species.

AB In group-living species, encounters with extragroup rivals can be one of the riskiest actions in which individuals participate. Different group members often have different incentives to participate during intergroup interactions, and individuals with fewer payoffs of competition, including those of the smaller sex and/or lower rank, may 'free-ride' to avoid the costs of conflict. However, there is little evidence for how different types of intergroup interactions (e.g. interactions that do not involve conflict) can influence the participation of individuals. We examined the ecological, demographic and social predictors of individual participation in interactions between 14 fully habituated mountain gorilla groups in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda from 2003 to 2015. The probability of an individual participating decreased with group size but remained relatively high in aggressive interactions and in multimale groups, illustrating the potential for 'load lightening' among group members. Males with fewer mating opportunities participated less often than males with more mating opportunities; however, male participation was significantly higher than female participation across all types of intergroup interactions. Females were more likely to be involved in aggressive interactions with solitary males, possibly to avoid the potential cost of infanticide if a resident male is killed or injured. Both sexes demonstrated more affiliative behaviours towards familiar groups, indicating a benefit of maintaining social relationships with familiar groups. Individuals show considerable variation in behaviour during intergroup interactions, and our results suggest that this variation is primarily driven by intergroup familiarity and individual reproductive benefits, both of which may have long-term consequences for individual fitness.

AB Access to multiple males can benefit a female in terms of increased fecundity and/or offspring performance. However, the presence of more males can also impose costs on females that arise from an elevated mating rate (e.g. due to increased genital damage, loss of feeding opportunities) and/or increased harassment. Different environments might influence the relative magnitude of these costs and benefits, because they can influence how often males and females encounter each other as well as the nature of these encounters. In the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, water is a limiting resource for females that can be obtained from male ejaculates. Here we explored whether the net fitness of female seed beetles is affected by breeding in either a dry or a wet environment when housed with differing numbers of males (none, one or four). Consistent with costly male harassment, females housed with four males laid significantly fewer eggs than those housed alone or with a single male, but there was no effect of the number of males on female egg-laying rate, life span, larval development rate or egg-adult survival of offspring. Although females in the wet environment lived significantly longer, there was only tentative evidence that water availability affected the net fitness cost to females of being exposed to more males. We conclude that to understand the evolution of mating systems it is important to explore how the environment affects female fitness by balancing the costs and benefits of being exposed to males.

AB Visual signals are widely used by animals in foraging, mating and predator avoidance. Body coloration plays an important role in the reproductive behavioural interactions of many diurnal animal species; however, its role in the courtship of nocturnal species has received little attention. We investigated the role of conspicuous body coloration, a white stripe on the forehead region, in the reproductive interactions of the nocturnal brown huntsman spider, Heteropoda venatoria. We performed a series of mating trials in which we manipulated the body coloration of males and the vision of females and determined the probabilities of mating success of males in different treatments. Results showed that males that courted females with intact vision had a significantly lower probability of mating success than males that courted females whose vision was blocked. Females with intact vision were also more likely to choose males with a white stripe than those whose stripe was removed. Therefore, we have unambiguously demonstrated for the first time that body coloration plays an important role as a visual signal in the mating of nocturnal spiders.

AB Food hoarding is critical to rodents for their survival and reproduction. However, the seeds cached by rodents often suffer heavy pilferage by competitors. Therefore, compensation for cache loss is crucial, especially for scatter-hoarding rodents, as they cannot aggressively defend their stored seeds, whereas larder-hoarding rodents can. Pilfering caches of other individuals may be an effective way to compensate for cache loss for rodents. Hence, cache pilfering is likely to be as important as hoarding to food-hoarding rodents. Scatter-hoarding rodents may rely on their olfactory abilities and explore a wide area to retrieve their cached seeds, which may help to increase the probability of encountering and pilfering others' caches, whereas it is not essential for larder-hoarding rodents. We hypothesized that rodents that showed stronger scatter-hoarding behaviour would be better pilferers. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between scatter-hoarding and pilferage behaviours among four coexisting species of rodents using seminatural enclosure experiments in southwest China. Both hoarding and cache pilfering differed significantly between the four species. The predominant scatter-hoarding rodents, red spiny rats, Maxomys surifer, had a strong cache-pilfering behaviour, whereas yellow-bellied rats, Rattus flavipectus, mainly adopted larder-hoarding strategies and had a weak cache-pilfering behaviour. Chinese white-bellied rats, NMI/enter confucianus, and chestnut rats, Niviventer fulvescens, had moderate scatter-hoarding and cache-pilfering behaviours. The intensity of cache pilfering was negatively correlated with the intensity of larder hoarding, but positively correlated with the intensity of scatter hoarding among the coexisting food-hoarding rodents. Our study suggests that the positive correlation between the intensities of scatter hoarding and cache pilfering is likely to facilitate reciprocal pilferage among scatter-hoarding rodents, which helps to maintain the stability of scatter-hoarding behaviour in these populations.

AB Many multimodal displays incorporate choreography, which occurs when animals modulate how body movements are timed across the display. Choreography typically involves pairing specific gestures with vocalizations. This allows the signaller to effectively produce a display that is more complex than either of its components in isolation. Moreover, some animals appear to use a special case of choreography that can augment vocal performance. Expanding the multimodal framework to incorporate choreography is therefore a necessary step towards understanding how combining two signals into one impacts a display's structure. We explore this in a case study of free-living Montezuma oropendolas, Psarocolius montezuma, a polygynous songbird that performs a dramatic song and dance. We found that two elements of this display (bow and wing spread), are each choreographed with the song's loudest note (dB(max)) and lowest peak frequency (LPF), respectively. This suggests that oropendolas electively time the swing and wing spread gesture with key song elements. Interestingly, there was a correlation between the depth of an individual's swing and LPF, which was not explained by body size or social context. However, social context did predict a difference in vocal performance in terms of frequency modulation. Meanwhile, there was no relationship between wing display performance and dB(max). This means that oropendolas choreograph their swing gesture to predict LPF, which might reflect an individual's motor skill or even directly influence vocal performance. Altogether, our data suggest that animals can incorporate phenotypically distinct forms of choreography into their display repertoire, where each instance of choreography serves as an opportunity to generate a novel signal when one did not exist before.

AB Insects have been extensively used as model systems to study mating preferences based on variation in acoustic signals. In many species, females perform phonotaxis towards attractive, long-range acoustic signals produced by males, whereas the final mating decision is based on an assessment of additional, multimodal, close-range cues. The production of acoustic signals is costly, because invested energy is inefficiently converted into acoustic power. Here, we investigated whether heat released as a by-product during song generation might serve as an additional cue during mate choice decisions. Males that broadcast highly energetic calling songs increased their thoracic temperature considerably above ambient temperatures. The use of this additional cue would turn the acoustic signal into an inherently bimodal one, indirectly indicating the quality of the sender. To test this hot male hypothesis, we performed trackball and Y-maze experiments with Anurogryllus muticus. For comparison, additional trackball experiments were conducted with Gryllus bimaculatus females. In all paradigms, females of both species showed no evidence of a preference for hot males and, therefore, we conclude that increases in thoracic temperature do not seem to play a role as a multimodal component in mate choice decisions in A. muticus.

AB Social network analysis has provided important insight into many population processes in wild animals. Constructing social networks requires quantifying the relationship between each pair of individuals in the population. Researchers often use association indices to convert observations into a measure of propensity for individuals to be seen together. At its simplest, this measure is just the probability of observing both individuals together given that one has been seen (the simple ratio index). However, this probability becomes more challenging to calculate if the detection rate for individuals is imperfect. We first evaluate the performance of existing association indices at estimating true association rates under scenarios where (1) only a proportion of all groups are observed (group location errors), (2) not all individuals are observed despite being present (individual location errors), and (3) a combination of the two. Commonly used methods aimed at dealing with incomplete observations perform poorly because they are based on arbitrary observation probabilities. We therefore derive complete indices that can be calibrated for the different types of incomplete observations to generate accurate estimates of association rates. These are provided in an R package that readily interfaces with existing routines. We conclude that using calibration data is an important step when constructing animal social networks, and that in their absence, researchers should use a simple estimator and explicitly consider the impact of this on their findings.

AB Leks are aggregations of sexually displaying males visited by receptive females and characterized by intense male-male competition to attract mates. Success in lekking species is often contingent upon male display output and/or lek attendance, with energetically costly displays functioning as an honest indicator of male quality. Furthermore, display spaces are vigorously defended by territorial males, and territory characteristics are often linked to male phenotype. Here we describe the courtship and territorial behaviour of lekking lesser short-tailed bats, Mystacina tuberculata, and both behaviours appear to be conditional on body size. During the breeding season, lekking males occupy and defend small tree hollows and sing for long periods of the night to attract females. Although some males sing alone, others form 'timeshare' singing roosts, where multiple males visit sequentially to sing each night. In our study, solitary males were significantly smaller than timeshare males and individually had both higher song outputs and higher roost occupancy rates, although timeshare roosts had higher overall occupancy rates. There appeared to be no fitness difference between the two male groups, and while one timeshare roost contained relatively closely related individuals (which roost settlement simulations indicate was not a chance event), four did not. We discuss factors that may promote timeshare formation, including competition for access to desired roosts and potential by-product mutualisms. Courtship and sexual selection in bats is largely undescribed, and thus our study provides a useful description of behaviour in a little-studied taxon.

AB Bumblebees are influenced by socially acquired information when deciding on which flowers to forage. In some circumstances, however, this attraction towards conspecifics may lead to suboptimal foraging performance because the presence of multiple pollinators typically results in a faster rate of nectar depletion in the flower. We tested the capacity of bees to learn to avoid flowers occupied by conspecifics when they offered a lower reward than unoccupied similar flowers. Bumblebees were able to discriminate between poorly and highly rewarding flowers by using the presence of a nonsocial cue ( a wooden rectangular white block). When poorly rewarding flowers were indicated by social cues ( model bees), however, bees did not discriminate between the two flower types except when an additional cue was provided ( flower colour). These findings indicate that bumblebees attach particular meaning to conspecific presence on flowers, even when this could lead to suboptimal foraging performance. The relatively lower flexibility in the use of social than nonsocial cues suggests a biased positive value of conspecifics as indicators of rewarded flowers.

AB Groups of animals sometimes coordinate their individual behaviours to produce an emergent group response. Examples of these quorum responses include stampedes in ungulates and orientation flights in honeybee swarms. In these groups, there may be some individuals who are knowledgeable about the threat or direction to go to, and others who are not. Few experimental studies have convincingly addressed whether the number of knowledgeable individuals to trigger an emergent group response is a fixed (absolute) number or a fixed proportion (percentage) of the group. We tested whether this threshold to produce an emergent group response was absolute or proportional in an experimental study of whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae: Dineutes). When whirligig beetles see an aerial predator, individuals make a startle response. If enough beetles startle, then the whole group makes a flash expansion. In our study, we manipulated the numbers of beetles in a group that were able to see the predator model by covering their eyes. We also manipulated group size (12, 24, 48). Our results reject the absolute hypothesis and support the proportional hypothesis for how many knowledgeable whirligigs it takes in a group to elicit an emergent flash expansion. At all three group sizes the threshold was approximately 10%. We also examined the interaction of the ratio of sighted/unsighted beetles and group size on swarm density, group area and longevity (duration of the flash expansion). Longevity was significantly leptokurtic, as would be expected for a stereotyped display. This is one of the first controlled empirical studies to differentiate between absolute and proportional thresholds in producing an emergent predator avoidance response.

AB Many species perform complex antipredator displays that deter attacks by informing predators that continued attempts at prey capture will be costly. However, because of the difficulties in studying the behaviour of free-ranging predators, we have a limited understanding of how predators respond to those signals. Here, we took advantage of our ability to quantify predatory behaviours of free-ranging side-winder rattlesnakes, Crotalus cerastes, to examine the influence of anti-snake behaviours performed by desert kangaroo rats, Dipodomys deserti. We recorded natural encounters and quantified the predator-deterrent behaviours displayed by the kangaroo rats, as well as any strikes performed by the rattlesnakes and whether the strikes were successful. We found that predator-deterrent signalling significantly reduced the probability that a rattlesnake would strike. This was most likely due to the ability of kangaroo rats to mobilize extremely rapid evasive leaps; even rats that appeared unaware of the snakes were almost always able to avoid rattlesnake strikes. The degree of effectiveness of this evasive leaping in countering rattlesnake predation was unexpected and indicates that this may be a rich system for exploring the biomechanics of extreme physical performance in a naturalistic context.

AB Dominance in socially foraging animals may be related to sex and to variation in individual quality. Individual quality may in turn reflect conditions during early development. We studied dominance in a cohort of adult European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, that had been subject to experimental manipulations of food supply and begging effort when they were nestlings. We measured dominance in two different contexts, contests over a food resource and relative position on a sloping perch, over the course of 3 weeks. Dominance in food contests was extremely stable over the 3 weeks and relative perch position somewhat stable. Males were dominant over females in contests over food and perched in higher positions. These sex differences were not explained by males' greater size or body weight. Food dominance and perch position were uncorrelated. Neither early life food supply nor early life begging effort affected food dominance; nor did an alternative measure of developmental stress, developmental telomere attrition. Birds that had been made to beg more as nestlings perched in higher positions than those that had begged less. Our results did not support the hypothesis that early life adversity leads to lower adult dominance rank in the context of feeding, and we suggest that relative perch position may have measured individual preference rather than competitive ability.

AB A given animal species may employ various strategies to make searching for resources more efficient. In clonal species, in which a parent and its offspring share identical genetic information, survival of even one individual can still ensure the survival of the colony. Thus, clonal species should display a variety of resource-searching strategies rather than discrete behaviours to counter an unknown environment. However, previous studies of host location behaviours of aphids that have dropped from their host plant identified two discrete behaviours: walking in a straight line and turning frequently to search for a nearby plant. We analysed the course characteristics of individuals originating from a single genetic clone of pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, that dropped to the ground from their host plant. We found that the use of high-resolution behaviour analysis is crucial in determining whether a behavioural phenotype is continuous or discrete. In contrast to previous studies, we found a wide continuum of walking behaviours. While some aphids progressed in a straight line, moving quickly away from the dropping point, others walked in paths with increasing levels of tortuosity. Tortuous paths were characterized by a series of loops (2-18 per path), presumably to locate nearby plants. Each loop took the aphid further from its dropping location. Aphids increased the speed of their searching, so that each loop took the same time to complete. Aphids performing fewer loops increased their speed more rapidly, hinting that the number of loops an aphid performs is determined at the outset of its movement. Aphids performing more loops were more inclined to climb a new host plant. This intraclonal continuum allows dropping aphids to counter the uncertainty of a new and possibly hazardous environment and maximize the probability that at least some individuals will survive and form a new colony.

   BRAIN; DISCRIMINATION; INFORMATION
AB Cerebral lateralization, the dominance of one brain side for a specific function, is a core feature of the vertebrate brain. Lateralized processing requires complex intra- and interhemispheric interactions mediating exchange, integration or suppression of information. The underlying functional organization of cooperative or independent processing is only basically understood and may differ between vertebrate species depending on the organization of commissural systems and overlap of sensory input. We explored intrahemispheric integration capacities in pigeons, Columba livia; although their visual system is primarily crossed and lateralized, it can still integrate interhemispheric information. Pigeons were trained in overlapping colour discriminations in which each hemisphere learned only half the information that represented a linear hierarchy. Therefore, interhemispheric memory about the relational values of the premise stimuli pairs had to be transferred and combined to master a transitive inference task. Pigeons displayed transitive responding under binocular but not under monocular seeing conditions. Hemispheric-specific strategies in accessing the associative values of transfer stimuli resulted in potential conflict with intrahemispheric memory and led to unihemispheric impairment in performance. The response pattern might represent a consequence of neuronal mechanisms avoiding interocular conflicts, and it also indicates that interhemispheric communication in pigeons is an active process that integrates intra- and interhemispheric information in a context-dependent and hemispheric-specific manner.

AB Modern life history theory hypothesizes that pace of life is a strong predictor of life history traits. Recently, the notion that life history studies should integrate animal behaviour has emerged, because between-individual differences in behaviour are often coupled with fitness differences. So far, studies have mainly focused on interspecies or interpopulation perspectives, and research on the effects of life history differences on individual behaviour remain scarce. In the present study we aimed to contribute to the understanding of how pace of life is related to consistent individual behaviour. We investigated the relationship between developmental speed and consistent behaviour of the field wolf spider, Pardosa agrestis. In this species, individuals originating from the same clutch can typically follow either a slow or a rapid developmental pathway, characterized by a developmental time of about 10 or 3 months, respectively. We found that spiders, regardless of their developmental speed, behaved consistently in most of the tests. Our results also show that individuals developing rapidly were significantly more active during exploration and more successful in prey-catching tests than slowly developing spiders. Although rapidly developing spiders were bolder in one of the tests, this difference did not persist over the repeated measurements. Our work seems to support the notion that pace of life and animal personality are correlated, and pace of life might predict the behavioural types of individuals.

AB The influence of social context in animal signals can lead to complex communicational patterns. In particular, the interaction between individuals can lead to intriguing collective dynamics, such as the temporal synchronization of signals. A fascinating example of such temporal synchronization involves the waving displays of fiddler crabs, in which males raise and lower their enlarged claws in species-specific rhythms. The adaptive significance of this phenomenon is still obscure, but possibly involves female preference for leading waving displays. However, waving displays are highly complex social signals that might be involved in a variety of forms of communication other than simply attracting females, but little is known about the influence of social context on wave synchronization. In this study we carried out field experiments to investigate the effect of two social factors, male density and female presence, on the level of waving synchronization in the fiddler crab Uca leptodactyla. Groups of males at varying densities were established in enclosures and recorded either in the presence or absence of a female. Our results indicate that the main factor driving synchronization is the presence of the female, with males not only changing the timing of their waving displays, but also altering their spatial distribution in the arenas. On the other hand, male density had a negligible effect on synchronization (despite significantly increasing waving rate), suggesting that male-male communication plays a minor role in the emergence of waving synchronization in this species.

AB Repeated association between subsets of individuals is a common feature of species living in social groups. Because colonial breeding, an extreme case of group living, is associated with certain group behaviour, colonial species are interesting study models to explore the occurrence of social bonds between individuals. As colonial species are usually highly philopatric, disentangling the fidelity to a breeding site from the fidelity to a group of individuals is challenging. Slender-billed gull, Chroicocephalus genei, colonies, however, relocate almost yearly. This behaviour makes it possible to study individual associations over several years, i.e. associations between individuals breeding in the same colony in more than 1 year. To quantify and identify the mechanisms that favour repeated individual associations across years, we analysed data from 14 years of observations of 953 individually marked gulls. Our results showed that some individuals repeatedly bred together across breeding seasons despite the colony moving every year. The probability of an individual selecting a colony increased with an increase in the number of birds that had bred in the same colony as that individual the previous year and not the overall number at the colony. However, we found yearly variation in group tenacity levels and that colony breeding failure favoured splitting of the groups. We also found that association rates rapidly decreased across years but stayed higher than random associations during 2 consecutive years after the first observations. Moreover, over the entire study period, we plotted a bipartite network and found that all colonies and individuals in the population were fully connected. This study reveals group tenacity across years in a colonial bird. Evolutionary pressures as well as the mechanisms favouring social bond persistence across years in colonial birds, however, need further research.

AB Masquerade is a strategy whereby prey animals resemble environmental objects (e.g. twigs, bird droppings and stones) or inedible animals to avoid predatory attack. However, most studies of this strategy have been restricted to only a few animal groups. Therefore, novel examples are required to elucidate the diversity of masquerade strategies. Neolamprologus furcifer is a maternal nest-brooding cichlid inhabiting shaded areas of large rocks in Lake Tanganyika. In contrast to the cryptic, dark brown adults, the small young have well-defined white stripes on their brown trunk in nest territories where many white-striped snails Reymondia horei are present. We hypothesized that young N. furcifer masquerade as the model snail R. horei. We found four results consistent with our hypothesis. (1) The size, coloration, shape and posture of the young fish resembled those of the snail. (2) Experimental removal of the model snail from territories caused females to attack predators more frequently than before the removal, indirectly suggesting the protective value of the young fish's coloration. (3) Parental females selectively removed nonmodel snails from their territory, probably causing the higher density of R. horei observed at nest sites. (4) Guarded young had black/white coloration only in populations where the model snails were present. Therefore, we suggest that young N. furcifer masquerade as the model snail R. horei. This study describes a novel masquerade pattern in which the protective value is improved by, and beneficial to, a third party. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Aggression is a prominent behaviour well studied in a large variety of animals, but it has not been well integrated within life history research. To address this shortcoming, we conducted a series of experiments simultaneously quantifying the effects of age and sexual experience on the use of aggression in male fruit flies. We studied three types of aggression relevant to male fruit flies' natural history: fighting in the context of resource defence, forced copulation with newly eclosed females, and coercion of recently mated females. Young, sexually mature flies were initially reluctant to use aggression towards either males or females. Within a few days, however, their use of aggression increased and then plateaued. While sexual experience caused males to decrease aggression towards females, it did not affect their aggression towards males. It is likely that aggression involves some cost, which leads males to favour peaceful over aggressive pursuit of females. However, sexually experienced males are probably highly motivated to deter other males from their apparently attractive resource. Our results highlight the importance of studying multiple types of aggression and the need for careful assessments of the relative fitness benefits and costs of aggression versus peaceful alternatives in shaping the life history of aggression.

AB Animal personality studies rely on collecting repeated behavioural data either in the field or under laboratory conditions. Conditions in the field should be far less stable than controlled laboratory conditions, and hence represent a potential source of variation in behaviour. Here we report on the first experiment to our knowledge that formally compares the repeatability of identical behaviours in the laboratory and the field, and across the transition from laboratory to field. Using a design that controls for observation number we compared two groups of sea anemones, observed across two experimental phases, either (1) in the field followed by the laboratory or (2) in the laboratory only. We analysed differences in behaviour across a range of levels including repeatability and its between-and withinindividual variance components. Although mean startle response durations varied between the laboratory and field, there was no significant difference in repeatability across situations. Within-individual variance differed between the two periods of the experiment for animals observed only in the laboratory but this effect was not present for those that transitioned from field to laboratory. Furthermore, the rank order of individual responses was stable for animals observed only in the laboratory but changed for those that transitioned from field to laboratory. These results show that although repeatability estimates in the laboratory can yield results like those obtained in the field, the underlying components of consistent variation in behaviour might be influenced by an interaction between prior experiences and the current situation in which the animals are observed.

AB Landscape modification (loss, fragmentation and degradation of habitat) is a universal form of human-induced rapid environmental change that creates strong spatial variation in environmental conditions. Behaviourally mediated responses to landscape modification may generate behavioural divergence among populations along environmental gradients. We tested whether movement behaviour of red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, is repeatable and whether it varies within and between forest stands of different ages in a fragmented landscape in New York, U.S.A. Water loss is a major constraint on P. cinereus mobility, and forest fragmentation creates spatial variation in desiccation risk. We quantified multiple components of individual movement behaviour in an unfamiliar environment in the laboratory and used ordination to identify behavioural variation among individuals in multivariate space. We tested for repeatability of individual behaviour and then examined behavioural differences between individuals captured from populations at two spatial scales where desiccation risk was expected to vary: (1) between edge and interior locations within forest stands and (2) between forest stands varying in time since agricultural abandonment. Variation in movement behaviour among individuals was characterized by three components: total movement activity (e.g. surface activity, distance moved, boundary crossings), substrate use (time on moist soil versus dry sand) and latency to initial movement. Each behavioural component was significantly repeatable. At the population level, individuals from old forest stands (>= 77 years) showed greater movement activity than individuals from young stands. Movement behaviour did not differ between individuals from edge and interior locations within forest stands. Our results demonstrate that P. cinereus individuals show consistent differences in movement behaviour in an unfamiliar environment. Moreover, we show that movement behaviour can be spatially structured within fragmented landscapes, but that behavioural divergence among populations depends on spatial scale.

AB Many plant species contain plant secondary metabolites (PSMs), such as alkaloids, in their tissues for protection against herbivore attack, but PSMs can also be found in floral nectar. Some pollinators have been shown to discriminate against floral nectar with PSMs and consuming PSMs may have negative fitness effects on pollinators. However, only a few studies have investigated the effects of ecologically relevant levels of PSMs on pollinator foraging performance. Here, we addressed the question of whether the natural concentrations of the alkaloids, nicotine and anabasine, found in tree tobacco, Nicotiana glauca, nectar affect foraging performance in Palestine sunbird, Nectarinia osea, pollinators that use the plant's nectar as a food source. We trained foraging sunbirds to discriminate between rewarding and nonrewarding artificial flowers based on colour. We measured sunbird foraging performance through their accuracy at distinguishing the two colours immediately after training (pretreatment), and again the following day after consuming sucrose solutions with or without alkaloids (post-treatment). We also explored other potential effects of PSM consumption by assessing bird activity level and flower visit rate. Birds that consumed alkaloids did not significantly change their activity level or flower visit rate across time (pre- and post-treatment) compared to birds that did not consume alkaloids (no significant time by treatment interaction). However, alkaloid consumption significantly decreased sunbird foraging performance in terms of their accuracy in distinguishing the rewarding colour, potentially due to reduced memory retention and/or other cognitive or physiological impairments following alkaloid consumption. We also found that sunbirds discriminated against higher, in favour of lower, ecologically relevant alkaloid concentrations in the nectar of tree tobacco and that previous exposure to alkaloids reduced overall consumption of alkaloid solutions. Reduced foraging performance due to PSM ingestion could greatly affect a pollinator's foraging efficiency, which could, in turn, affect both pollinator and plant reproductive fitness.

AB Perception is frequently cross-modal, involving interactions among stimuli in multiple sensory modalities. Cross-modal integration of sensory stimuli is well established in humans and laboratory mammals, but the understanding of its mechanisms and evolution is limited by a lack of data from a broader taxonomic range in an ecological framework. Our aim in this study was to test whether the precedence effect, the bias in sound localization towards earlier arriving sounds, which is modulated by simultaneous visual stimulation in humans, is also susceptible to cross-modal effects of visual stimulation in two treefrog species, Hyla versicolor and Hyla cinerea. We used two-choice playback experiments to test whether female preferences for leading male advertisement call stimuli were enhanced or suppressed, respectively, by visual stimuli co-localized with leading or lagging call elements. In contrast to humans, strong female leader preferences were generally robust to cross-modal visual stimulation. We propose that divergence in both sensory systems and ecology has led to variation in the relative reliability of visual and acoustic cues of direction, which may explain the differences between humans and frogs. We argue that studies of cross-modal effects on sensory processing are an important tool for understanding the evolution of perceptual mechanisms.

AB Pooling information can allow groups to make better decisions than individuals, an idea that underlies the use of groups to make important decisions in human society. Group size is also thought to influence the accuracy of decision making in nonhuman animals, but despite the enormous variation in the size and composition of animal societies, very few studies have explored this question outside of humans. Furthermore, although both humans and animals need to make decisions in dynamic environments and models suggest that environmental conditions can alter or even invert the advantage of group size, no empirical study has addressed how the advantage of group size may vary with environmental context. In this study I investigated how group size and environmental context influence decision making using an ant model system in which colonies use a quorum-based process to decide collectively among new nesting sites. Decision making unfolded in a similar manner in colonies of different size, as quorum thresholds and task allocation scaled with colony size. Larger colonies, however, made more accurate decisions than small colonies, and in most cases did so more rapidly. There was also an influence of environmental conditions, as whereas the decision accuracy of small groups was comparable to that of large groups in benign conditions, decision making was largely ineffective in small colonies in more challenging conditions. Colonies adapted to different environmental conditions by adjusting quorum thresholds, shifting thresholds down to emphasize speed when under stress and showing a pattern of higher thresholds in complex environments. The advantage to larger colonies probably stems from their greater information collecting and processing ability, which also serves to buffer them from the negative influences of more challenging environments.

AB Access to surface water is crucial for herbivores in arid ecosystems. Here, we build a game-theoretical model, based on an evolutionary algorithm, to study the influence of ecological factors on the temporal patterns of presence at waterholes in the herbivore community. In this model, we incorporate the specific features of arid environments, namely, the important hydric losses endured by individuals exposed during the warmest hours of the day, and competition for access to water, both within and between species. We also consider the presence of ambushing predators around waterholes, particularly during dark hours. In response to this predation regime, our model predicts a strong aggregative tendency in herbivores. The number of groups, however, is variable, as well as the time these groups choose to attend the waterhole, even if the total number of individuals is fixed. The reason is a multiplicity of possible evolutionarily stable strategies, corresponding to different responses to the trade-off between the advantages of grouping, in terms of risk dilution, and its costs, in terms of increased competition. This variety of possible behavioural responses affects, in turn, the moments when the waterhole is occupied, and the moments when the different species meet each other. In general, herbivores also respond to predation threat by avoiding coming to waterholes after dusk. However, the cumulative effects of a relatively high level of predation during the day and a high level of interspecific competition for access to water may induce an important presence of herbivores at the waterhole at night. Our predictions are discussed in the light of existing empirical studies. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Most animals are under strong selection to avoid predation, and several strategies have evolved in response to this selection. The developmental change in colour patterns of toxin-protected chrysomeline larvae provides a system to investigate the potential costs and benefits of conspicuous coloration development in animals. Field experiments in which artificial, palatable prey of various colour patterns were presented to wild avian predators confirmed that warning colours alone are not sufficient to deter predation, but that the spatial distribution of yellow and black coloration may be key to conferring a warning signal.

AB The ability to associate environmental cues with valuable resources strongly increases the chances of finding them again, and thus memory often guides animal movement. For example, many temperate region amphibians show strong breeding site fidelity and will return to the same areas even after the ponds have been destroyed. In contrast, many tropical amphibians depend on exploitation of small, scattered and fluctuating resources such as ephemeral pools for reproduction. It remains unknown whether tropical amphibians rely on spatial memory for effective exploitation of their reproductive resources. Poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) routinely shuttle their tadpoles from terrestrial clutches to dispersed aquatic deposition sites. We investigated the role of spatial memory for relocating previously discovered deposition sites in an experimental population of the brilliant-thighed poison frog, Allobates femoralis, a species with predominantly male tadpole transport. We temporarily removed an array of artificial pools that served as the principal tadpole deposition resource for the population. In parallel, we set up an array of sham sites and sites containing conspecific tadpole odour cues. We then quantified the movement patterns and site preferences of tadpole-transporting males by intensive sampling of the area and tracking individual frogs. We found that tadpole-carrier movements were concentrated around the exact locations of removed pools and most individuals visited several removed pool sites. In addition, we found that tadpole-transporting frogs were attracted to novel sites that contained high concentrations of conspecific olfactory tadpole cues. Our results suggest that A. femoralis males rely heavily on spatial memory for efficient exploitation of multiple, widely dispersed deposition sites once they are discovered. Additionally, olfactory cues may facilitate the initial discovery of the new sites. (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) is widespread across taxa. One adaptive hypothesis to explain the occurrence and maintenance of SSB is that it acts to intensify or diminish aggression by providing males with a means to reinforce or resolve dominance. However, evidence for this hypothesis is very limited across taxa and the possibility that SSB acts as an extension of intrasexual competition remains contentious. We investigated the role of SSB in intensifying or diminishing aggression in the broad-horned flour beetle, Gnatocerus cornutus. We tested the hypothesis that SSB is an extension of male-male competition by observing how the occurrence of SSB and the stability of SSB courtship roles (i.e. whether males switched between mounting and being mounted) influenced levels of aggression within pairs. We found that, typically, males rapidly establish fixed SSB roles and moreover that the occurrence of SSB and the stability of SSB roles had a highly significant effect on levels of aggression observed within pairs. Pairs in which one male consistently mounted the other showed significantly lower levels of aggression than pairs in which neither male exhibited SSB or in which males continuously switched SSB roles and attempted to mount each other. Furthermore, males that were consistently on the receiving end of SSB demonstrated lower propensity to court females and had a lower mating success than active males. This pattern was analogous to that found in loser males as a result of fighting. Males that lost fights also courted less and had lower mating success than males that won fights. Our findings provide the first empirical support for the hypothesis that SSB is an extension of male-male competition. Furthermore, our results suggest that SSB may act as a display, allowing males to resolve dominance hierarchies without escalating into an injurious fight.

AB The effects of social and ecological stressors on female reproductive success vary among species and, in mammals, previous reviews have identified no clear patterns. However, few studies have simultaneously examined the relation between social rank and stressors and the relationships among rank, stressors and reproductive success. We used a long-term data set to study free-living facultatively social yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, to isolate the relationship between female social dominance rank and faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels (our measure of basal stress) in adult females. In addition, we examined whether rank and FGM levels were associated with reproductive success by quantifying the probability of an individual successfully weaning a litter and, for those who did, litter size. Highranking females had lower FGM levels and larger litters. However, females with the highest FGM levels were significantly more likely to wean a litter. Importantly, body condition (as measured by previous year's mass) was also positively associated with breeding and with weaning larger litters. Thus, although low-ranking females probably experienced more social stressors than high-ranking females and although adult females often delayed their first reproduction until they were of a sufficient mass, our results suggest that elevated baseline FGM levels failed to mediate reproductive suppression. Perhaps, in species like marmots that have only a single chance per year to reproduce, reproductive suppression should be rare. These results highlight the importance of social status, body condition and predator abundance on determining reproductive success in highly seasonal breeders.

AB Social interactions are critical for reproduction in many animals. Since several pathogens are transmitted by social contact, females searching for mating partners should select males that can signal being healthy. Not all signals, however, may be reliable, since males from a number of species can overcome behavioural symptoms of infection when mating opportunities are available. Here, we manipulated sickness status of male house mice, Mus musculus domesticus, by administering an immune challenge (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and studied the consequences of this manipulation for two signals that function in mate attraction in this species: ultrasonic vocalizations and darcin (a urinary protein). Additionally, we quantified female visits to immune-challenged and control males, and the males' plasma testosterone levels. LPS-injected males had lower darcin and lower regular ultrasonic syllable production than control-injected males, while producing a larger number of high-frequency ultrasonic syllables. We conclude that immune-challenged male mice presented with a receptive female cannot maintain the production of sexually attractive signals. Females might use some of these cues when making mating decisions, since they spent significantly less time near LPS-injected males. Testosterone was reduced in LPS-injected males and could be a unifying mechanism downregulating both of the traits quantified. Darcin and ultrasonic vocalizations produced in the context of courtship may therefore function as reliable indicators of current health status.

AB Aggression is a central trait affecting fitness, which has been well studied in many animals. As a part of a research programme integrating mechanisms and fitness consequences of aggression, we examined the adaptive functions of antagonistic interactions in fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, a species in which aggression has been studied primarily in the context of territorial behaviour. In our experiments, males at an attractive food patch were more aggressive towards other males when they were in the presence of their recent mates than when they were in the presence of females mated with other males. Furthermore, while recently mated males accompanied by their mates were more aggressive than virgin males, recently mated males and virgin males showed similar levels of aggression in the presence of females mated with other males. When we allowed focal males to mate inside experimental arenas and then added intruder males, the intruder males spent less time on the food patch, remated with the resident females at lower frequencies and fathered a smaller proportion of offspring when the focals males remained in the arenas than when we removed the focal males. Our results reveal a novel adaptive function of aggression in fruit flies: in addition to fighting to defend attractive food sources that attract prospective mates, males rely on aggression to guard their mates, and such mate guarding enhances their fitness.

AB The main function of male sexual advertisement calls is to attract females, and therefore, most studies of responses to calls focus on females. Males may, however, respond to the calls of other males in some species, for one of two reasons: (1) to parasitize the calling of an attractive male by sitting close by and mating with attracted females, or (2) to locate breeding aggregations. We hypothesized that if males were parasitizing the calls of other males, they would select calls with characteristics that attracted females. On the other hand, if they showed no preferences for call characteristics it would suggest that they used calls to locate breeding aggregations or other resources. We used as our model organism invasive cane toads, Rhinella marina, a species in which males and females both respond to conspecific vocalizations with phonotaxis. To determine preferences in call choice experiments, we used the natural calls of five males, with extreme and median call characteristics (dominant frequency and pulse rate). Female cane toads tended to prefer calls with low pulse rate and dominant frequency, which are indicative of large body size in males, compared to a call with median characteristics. Overall, females preferred the calls of larger males, and selected calls of the largest male that was smaller than themselves, possibly because mating between similar- sized individuals facilitates fertilization in anurans. Male cane toads exhibited strong and rapid phonotaxis, but showed no preferences for specific calls. We therefore concluded that male toads probably use acoustic signals as an indicator of the location of water, or of breeding sites, and thus potentially of females. Sexual differences in call preferences apparently reflect differences in the use of advertisement calls between the sexes in cane toads. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Understanding animal contests has benefited greatly from employing the concept of fighting ability, termed resource-holding potential (RHP), with body size/weight typically used as a proxy. However, victory does not always go to the larger/heavier contestant and the existing RHP approach thereby fails to accurately predict contest outcome. Aggressiveness, typically studied as a personality trait, might explain part of this discrepancy. We investigated whether aggressiveness forms a component of RHP, examining effects on contest outcome, duration and phases, plus physiological measures of costs (lactate and glucose). Furthermore, using the correct theoretical framework, we provide the first study to investigate whether individuals gather and use information on aggressiveness as part of an assessment strategy. Pigs, Sus scrofa, were assessed for aggressiveness in resident-intruder tests whereby attack latency reflects aggressiveness. Contests were then staged between size-matched animals diverging in aggressiveness. Individuals with a short attack latency in the resident-intruder test almost always initiated the first bite and fight in the subsequent contest. However, aggressiveness had no direct effect on contest outcome, whereas bite initiation did lead to winning in contests without an escalated fight. This indirect effect suggests that aggressiveness is not a component of RHP, but rather reflects a signal of intent. Winner and loser aggressiveness did not affect contest duration or its separate phases, suggesting aggressiveness is not part of an assessment strategy. A greater asymmetry in aggressiveness prolonged contest duration and the duration of displaying, which is in a direction contrary to assessment models based on morphological traits. Blood lactate and glucose increased with contest duration and peaked during escalated fights, highlighting the utility of physiological measures as proxies for fight cost. Integrating personality traits into the study of contest behaviour, as illustrated here, will enhance our understanding of the subtleties of agonistic interactions.

AB Male Nicrophorus burying beetles utilize two alternative mate-finding tactics: searching and signalling. The searching tactic involves flying in search of a carcass on which to mate, while the signalling tactic involves emitting pheromone in the absence of a carcass to attract females. All males use both tactics, but the amount of time spent using each tactic differs between individuals. Because all males are phenotypically plastic in the time spent using alternative behaviours, the expression is likely to be condition dependent on some environmental cue, such as the availability of reproductive resources (i.e. females and carcasses). We tested how the expression of alternative tactics is influenced by previous mating experience and the perceived availability of females versus carcasses by using a repeated measures design in which mate-finding behaviour of males was observed before and after exposure to: (1) multiple females but no carcasses, (2) multiple females and multiple carcasses, (3) multiple carcasses but no females, or (4) no females or carcasses (control). Males in the multiple-female group (but lacking a carcass) allocated significantly more time to signalling, as did males in the control group lacking both mating and carcass experience. Thus, males that did not encounter carcasses during the treatment period increased pheromone emission thereafter. In the two groups that were given carcasses, however, investment in signalling was not altered. With respect to time allocated to searching, control, multiple-female and multiple-carcass groups all significantly decreased time spent searching, whereas males in the female-and-carcass group did not alter time allocated to searching. Our results demonstrate that environmental cues do influence which alternative tactic male burying beetles use, and that the chosen tactic is influenced by the availability of both receptive females and carcasses on which to breed.

AB The foraging behaviour of omnivores is often difficult to predict and, thus, our understanding of their role in ecosystems is limited. The majority of our knowledge about omnivores comes from studies examining their preferences for different species of plants and prey under different conditions. The potential effect of intraspecific variation in food quality on omnivore foraging behaviour has received less attention. To enhance our understanding of the foraging behaviour of omnivores, we used focal observations in the laboratory to monitor the foraging behaviour and activity budget of an omnivorous insect, Dicyphus hesperus Knight (Hemiptera: Miridae), in arenas where a single species of plant food and a single species of prey food were provided at varying levels of quality based on nitrogen content. The activity budget of D. hesperus was not balanced; it was dominated by prey feeding, followed by plant feeding and probing. Foraging behaviour of D. hesperus was affected by the interaction of prey and plant quality, such that optimal foraging theory could predict its foraging behaviour in the presence of prey reared on high N-fertilized tomato plants, but not in the presence of low N-fertilized tomato plants. Neither prey quality nor plant quality affected the rate of prey consumption or the handling time of prey by D. hesperus during the observation period. Our results highlight the complexity of omnivore feeding behaviour and indicate that feeding decisions are not based only on the prey or plant species provided, but also on the quality of those resources.

AB Movement through an environment provides sighted organisms with dynamic visual cues known as optic flow. In flying insects, optic flow is important for collision avoidance, flight speed control and landing manoeuvres. The function of optic flow is much less understood in other taxa, particularly in fish. Despite a lack of quantitative studies, optomotor responses (OMRs) to optic flow are presumed to be nearly ubiquitously important for rheotaxis (orientation to currents), a widespread behaviour that confers a number of benefits, including energy conservation. Here we show that while very young larval zebrafish, Danio rerio, exhibit positive OMRs (swim in the direction of optic flow), thereby minimizing optic flow on the retina, older larvae and adults exhibit negative OMRs that increase optic flow. While the reason for this reversal remains unclear, negative OMRs are inconsistent with optically driven positive rheotaxis (orienting upstream). Furthermore, when optic flow cues are placed in conflict with nonvisual (mechanical) cues generated by water currents, adult fish largely ignore the optic flow cues relying instead on nonvisual cues. These results challenge a century-old belief that optic flow and the resulting OMRs are a dominant sensorimotor mechanism in rheotaxis, highlighting the importance of future work on life history changes in OMRs and the possible modulatory influence of learned, multisensory expectations.

AB Individual differences in contributions to cooperation can be strikingly consistent over time giving rise to alternative cooperative phenotypes within animal societies. Following the social niche specialization hypothesis, these consistent differences may be driven by social conflict over reproductive opportunities if individuals specializing as 'breeders' and 'nonbreeders' experience a beneficial reduction in social conflict and differential costs associated with cooperating. This hypothesis gives three testable predictions: (1) consistent individual differences in cooperative behaviour will be accompanied by consistent individual differences in reproductive behaviour, (2) individuals contributing heavily to reproduction will contribute relatively little to cooperative behaviours within the same breeding attempt and vice versa, and (3) individuals that consistently contribute heavily to reproduction over their lifetime will also consistently contribute less to cooperative behaviours and vice versa. We tested these predictions with a 15-year investigation into the lifetime patterns of mate guarding and two forms of cooperative offspring care ('babysitting' and 'escorting') in a wild population of banded mongooses. We found significant repeatability of individual contributions to both cooperative behaviours, as well as significant repeatability of individual levels of mate guarding. However, we found no evidence of negative covariance between contributions to cooperative and reproductive behaviours either within breeding attempts or across lifetimes. This suggests that the observed consistent individual differences in both cooperative behaviour and reproduction are not associated; there is no evidence of a trade-off between reproduction and cooperation. However, we found a significant positive covariance between babysitting and escorting when estimated both within breeding attempts and across lifetimes, which suggests that some group members are generally more cooperative than others, contributing more to both behaviours over their lifetimes. The drivers of this consistent individual variation in contributions to cooperation remain unknown. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Insects are able to learn from experience acquired in their natal habitat, thereby obtaining adaptive advantages. However, the acquisition of new information could involve defects in retrieving previously learned information (i.e. forgetting), a process known as retroactive interference, which diminishes learning capacities. In this study, we evaluated the learning capacity and the impact of retroactive interference during host searching by ecological specialist and generalist phytophagous insects. We examined whether the generalist aphid, Myzus persicae s. str., and the tobacco-specialized subspecies, Myzus persicae nicotianae differ in (1) learning capacity, or (2) retroactive interference during host selection, and (3) whether the learning-associated foraging gene (for) is differentially expressed. Differences in learning capacity and retroactive interference were assessed in bioassays using rearing hosts and alternative hosts followed by choices between or transferences to rearing or alternative hosts. During the pre-alighting phase of host searching, the generalist aphid showed attraction to the alternative host after 12 h of experience, while the specialist showed no attraction to the alternative host regardless of the amount of time on the plant. The retroactive interference experiments showed that when aphids were exposed to an alternative host for different periods, odour attraction to the rearing host persisted in the generalist after 72 h of experience on the alternative host, whereas in the specialist the attraction to the rearing host was lost after 12 h of experience on the alternative host. During the post-alighting phase of host searching, both taxa performed better on their rearing hosts, but in the specialist aphid, a short period on the alternative host reversed this behaviour. In addition, the specialist showed lower levels of gene for expression, which could be associated with the differences in learning performance. Herein we present further evidence of differences in learning capacities between a specialist and a generalist aphid, which may influence the process of host searching and evolution of ecological specialization.

AB The presence of a conspecific can ameliorate an individual's stress response. This social buffering is known to be widespread in social mammals but the capacity of birds to act as social buffers has not yet been determined. We previously demonstrated that domestic hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, show socially mediated arousal when watching their chicks receiving an aversive air puff. Furthermore, the hens' expectation of the situation strongly influenced the chicks' behaviour. Here we examined whether hens act as a social buffer; reducing their chicks' stress response to an aversive stimulus. Pairs of chicks were exposed to an air puff treatment and a control, each with and without their mothers. Chicks showed a suite of responses to the air puff (including increased standing, reduced eye temperature, preening and ground pecking). Maternal absence exacerbated the chicks' preening and ground-pecking responses to this stressor. Individual hens varied in their effectiveness as a social buffer and this was associated with their socially mediated arousal when (matched pairs of) their chicks received an air puff. Specifically, the hens' heart rate increase was strongly negatively correlated with the degree to which chick preening and ground pecking increased with maternal presence. This is the first demonstration that avian mothers are able to reduce their chicks' stress responses to an aversive stimulus. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Group members' individual experience can have important influences when navigating collectively. However, how exactly they structure group travel performance is still not fully understood. This study investigated how navigation and leadership dynamics are affected by the presence of an experienced individual in king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, chick pairs. We tested pairs of chicks in which two partners differed in their level of prior navigational experience. Naive pairs consisted of two chicks that had no previous homing experience. In mixed pairs, one chick was naive, but the other chick had previous homing experience. Our results showed that in mixed pairs the navigational performance of naive chicks improved if they travelled together with an experienced partner compared to when they walked alone. Experienced chicks, however, maintained their relatively high speeds and efficiencies irrespective of whether they walked with a partner or independently. We also observed a shift in leadership dynamics: in naive pairs, both chicks took turns in leading and following, while in mixed pairs, experienced chicks tended to lead throughout. Our work provides a valuable empirical system in which to test theoretical models of leadership and information transfer within groups. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animals can learn to revisit locations at which foraging resources will renew over time. This ability is known as 'time-place' learning. Although there is clear evidence for time-place learning from animals trained and tested in the laboratory, not all species learn time-place tasks with similar ease. Since hummingbirds feed from food sources that are constant in space and that renew with time, it seems plausible these birds might learn time-place associations and do so readily. Here, then, we tested whether wild, free-living rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, could learn the time and place at which four artificial flower patches were rewarded. Flowers in each of the four patches contained reward for only 1 h each day but the time and sequence in which patches were rewarded were repeated across days. Most birds learned when to visit each patch. To determine whether the birds used ordinal or circadian timing to choose the correct patch at the correct time, we ended the experiment with a single test trial in which we presented the patches (all flowers empty) only at the fourth hour of the day. The birds visited neither the patch that was normally rewarded first (daily ordinal timing) nor the fourth patch (time of day). These results suggest that the time component of the time-place learning in these birds requires both ordinal and circadian information. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Understanding how marine species use their environment has become increasingly important in management and conservation. Acoustic monitoring allows long-term tracking of marine animal movement that is traditionally analysed using kernel-based home range estimators. These traditional methods, however, are limited because they do not examine movement pathways within activity spaces. Network analysis (NA) provides an alternative approach to traditional home range analysis that treats acoustic receivers as network nodes and analyses movement between nodes. To investigate the utility of NA in identifying core use areas and compare the results with traditional analysis, a case study using acoustically monitored coastal sharks was conducted. To make direct comparisons with static traditional analysis a temporal scale was not explicitly explored. Comparison of traditional analysis and NA demonstrated that both methods provided similar results for identifying core use areas (50% kernel utilization distribution (KUD) equivalent), but that NA tended to overestimate general use areas (95% KUD equivalent) compared to kernel-based methods. Furthermore, frequent bidirectional movements within core use areas were identified by NA, indicating the importance of movement corridors within or between core areas. Movements between acoustic receivers outside core use areas were less frequent and unidirectional suggesting transiting movements. Therefore, NA may be a practical alternative to traditional home range metrics by providing useful data interpretation that allows for a comprehensive picture of animal movement, including identifying core use areas and pathways used.

AB Birdsong is a complex, learned vocalization that is strongly shaped by early developmental conditions. In males, stressful early-life conditions are known to have adverse effects on the development of song and its supporting neural structures (i.e. the song-control system). Conversely, how developmental stress affects female song preferences and brain development is understudied. We subjected female European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, to an unpredictable food stressor through the first few months of life. As adults, we first assessed females' song preferences using an operant-conditioning task in a (1) conspecific versus heterospecific song comparison and (2) short-versus long-bout starling song comparison. Then, we measured the immediate-early gene (Zenk) response in auditory forebrain areas when birds were listening to either conspecific song or heterospecific song and quantified the volumes of song-control brain regions. We observed that females reared in control conditions showed a significant behavioural preference for conspecific song (over heterospecific song), whereas females reared in food-restricted conditions did not. Although individual females showed clear preferences for either short-or long-bout starling song, the direction of this preference was not consistent between birds. Control females had significantly more Zenk induction in auditory forebrain areas than food-restricted females when listening to conspecific song. Heterospecific song playback resulted in significantly less Zenk induction than conspecific song playback, with no difference between treatment groups. Across the song-control regions measured, we observed no significant differences in volumes between the treatment groups. However, we did find that the volume of the song-control region HVC was positively related to the strength of preference that females displayed in the conspecific versus heterospecific operant preference test. Thus, early-life stressors known to affect male song and brain development have similar effects on female behaviour and neural response to song stimuli.

AB Social manipulation represents an important aspect of human social interactions, including cooperative ones. Yet, little is known about social manipulation of conspecifics in nonhuman great apes. We investigated how orang-utan, Pongo abelii, mothers used their offspring as a means to access food in competitive and cooperative test situations. In the competitive situations, only the offspring could retrieve high-value food rewards. Here, orang-utan mothers often stole the food from their offspring and even coerced them into retrieving it to begin with, by moving the offspring to the test site, guiding their arms and bodies towards the food, and even reorienting their hands so that they would grab the food. However, modifying the task constraints so that mothers were now required to cooperate with their offspring to obtain the food changed the mothers' behaviour completely. Suddenly, mothers cooperated with their offspring by handing them tools that only their offspring could use to activate a mechanism delivering food for both of them. We conclude that orang-utans, like humans, are able to flexibly use conspecifics as a social tool and that this kind of social tool use supports their ability to cooperate.

AB Emotions are important because they enable the selection of appropriate behavioural decisions in response to external or internal events. Techniques for understanding and assessing animal emotions, and particularly positive ones, are lacking. Emotions can be characterized by two dimensions: their arousal (bodily excitation) and their valence (negative or positive). Both dimensions can affect emotions in different ways. It is thus crucial to assess their effects on biological parameters simultaneously, so that accurate indicators of arousal and valence can be identified. To find convenient and noninvasive tools to assess emotions in goats, Capra hircus, we measured physiological, behavioural and vocal responses of goats in four situations: (1) control (no external stimulus, neutral); (2) anticipation of a food reward (positive); (3) food-related frustration (negative); (4) isolation away from conspecifics (negative). These situations were characterized by different levels of arousal, assessed a posteriori by heart rates measured during the tests. We found several clear, reliable indicators of arousal and valence. During situations of higher arousal, goats had lower heart rate variability and higher respiration rates. They displayed more head movements, moved more, had their ears pointed forwards more often and on the side (horizontal) less often and produced more calls. They also produced calls with higher fundamental frequencies and higher energy distribution. In positive situations, goats had their ears oriented backwards less often and spent more time with their tails up than in negative situations. Furthermore, they produced calls in which the fundamental frequencies were less variable. Our methods for assessing the effects of emotional arousal and valence on biological parameters could lead to more effective monitoring and understanding of animal emotions, as well as to a better understanding of the evolution of emotions through cross-species comparisons.

AB Cooperative group defence can provide benefits both to participants in the collective actions and to free-riding group members. The study of individual strategies used during collective action is thus useful for our understanding the nature and evolution of cooperation in animal societies. Here, we examine social and genetic factors influencing the participation of adult and subadult males in naturally occurring howling bouts of five multimale-multifemale groups of black howler monkeys, Alouatta pigra, at Palenque National Park, Mexico during a 28-month study. Among howler monkeys, howling bouts are often used in the context of intergroup spacing as a form of cooperative group defence. For howling bouts in which all resident males were in view at least 80% of the time (N = 387 bouts), we calculated the percentage of time that each male participated and the percentage of time that each intragroup male-male dyad participated mutually. Male participation was significantly greater during howling bouts that were part of intergroup encounters compared to spontaneous calls or calls in response to nearby calls when there was no visual contact with rival groups. Adult males initiated and participated during howling bouts significantly more than subadult males. Among adult males, those that had sired offspring in the group initiated and participated significantly more than males without offspring in the group. Kinship and proximity patterns among pairs of males did not influence the percentage of time that those dyads howled mutually. Together, these findings suggest that cooperative group defence in male black howler monkeys evolved principally through mutualism in which participants gain direct fitness benefits.

AB Social networks arise from complex interactions among multiple individuals and affect the emergent properties of groups (e. g. cooperation, disease spread, information transfer, etc.). Cooperation among nonkin is generally predicted to be favoured in structured social networks where individuals primarily interact only with certain individuals. Long-tailed manakins, Chiroxiphia linearis, form lek groups of as many as 15 unrelated males, whose members can attend multiple leks. At each lek, several top-ranked males perform the majority of obligate cooperative courtship displays. We used exponential random graph (ERG) modelling to analyse manakin cooperation networks constructed from 2-year time intervals over a 14-year study period. ERG modelling evaluates how local processes contribute to formation of global social network structure. We found that four local processes of link formation largely explained the overall structure of male manakin cooperation networks: (1) the spatial proximity of birds: males were more likely to cooperate if they primarily displayed at the same or neighbouring leks; (2) social status of birds: males were more likely to cooperate as they moved up the social queue at leks; (3) triad closure: males were more likely to cooperate with a 'friend of a friend' than with males with which they did not share a mutual partner; and (4) link persistence: males were more likely to cooperate with males whom they had cooperated with in the past. Other plausible mechanisms, such as selective mixing (the tendency to interact with individuals of similar or dissimilar social status) and preferential attachment by degree (whereby individuals with many social links gain additional links) did not consistently explain the structure of male cooperation networks at leks. These local processes may facilitate cooperation among long-tailed manakins by creating structured social networks in which males interact with only a subset of the population.

AB The detection and assessment of pain in animals is crucial to improving their welfare in a variety of contexts in which humans are ethically or legally bound to do so. Thus clear standards to judge whether pain is likely to occur in any animal species is vital to inform whether to alleviate pain or to drive the refinement of procedures to reduce invasiveness, thereby minimizing pain. We define two key concepts that can be used to evaluate the potential for pain in both invertebrate and vertebrate taxa. First, responses to noxious, potentially painful events should affect neurobiology, physiology and behaviour in a different manner to innocuous stimuli and subsequent behaviour should be modified including avoidance learning and protective responses. Second, animals should show a change in motivational state after experiencing a painful event such that future behavioural decision making is altered and can be measured as a change in conditioned place preference, self-administration of analgesia, paying a cost to access analgesia or avoidance of painful stimuli and reduced performance in concurrent events. The extent to which vertebrate and selected invertebrate groups fulfil these criteria is discussed in light of the empirical evidence and where there are gaps in our knowledge we propose future studies are vital to improve our assessment of pain. This review highlights arguments regarding animal pain and defines criteria that demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, whether animals of a given species experience pain.

AB Understanding the ways individuals socialize with each other and how they differ temporally, spatially and phylogenetically is key to unravelling the evolutionary processes that shape social evolution. Our current knowledge of social evolution in vertebrates, however, has primarily come from bird and mammalian studies. Despite being largely understudied, reptiles remain an important piece of the puzzle in our study of social evolution; they represent a major class of vertebrates and, similar to mammals and birds, many are gregarious. Increasing our understanding of sociality in reptiles is important given that it would allow for comparisons across phylogenetically distinct vertebrate classes. In this study, we investigated the social structure of the eastern water dragon, Intellagama lesueurii, and found that males and females showed both preference and avoidance for members of either sex. Furthermore, we found sex differences in the extent of individual sociability: females generally formed stronger associations with one another than any other sex class (e. g. male-male, male-female). Although association patterns correlated to some extent with home range overlap, we found no evidence of a correlation with kinship. Overall, our study presents additional evidence that sociality can evolve outside the realm of kin selection. (C) 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Some prey respond to predator cues by altering their behaviour, but the response may depend on predator diet and identity. There are few data on how predator feeding status and diet affect the behaviour of aquatic insects and on the specificity of the response of these prey to different predators. We present the results of four bioassays conducted in microcosms to evaluate the relationship between predator fish diet, predator identity and the predator avoidance behaviour of mayfly prey of the genus Baetis to elucidate the origin and specificity of the antipredator response. Results from the first bioassay indicated that the response of Baetis to predatory trout is independent of diet, which enabled us to rule out the following potential origins of the signal: alarm cues emitted by wounded Baetis conspecifics, salivary enzymes released by feeding fish and excretion products that may contain Baetis and conspecific odours. Thus, we focused further experiments on fish cutaneous mucus as the potential origin of cues that cause Baetis to reduce its activity. In two bioassays, we observed that North American Baetis bicaudatus did not distinguish between five freshwater fish species that co-inhabit the same drainage, despite differences in their relative risk of predation (four predatory salmonid species and one omnivorous sucker species). However, in another bioassay, we observed that European Baetis rhodani larvae did not respond to cutaneous mucus of novel predators (carp, seawater turbot or frog), indicating that Baetis do not show a general response to all mucus donor organisms. Our bioassays identified mucus as the potential origin of the cue eliciting antipredator behaviour in Baetis, providing much needed insight into the specificity of fish-associated chemical cues that cause some prey to respond. Experimental approaches similar to the one used in this study may increase our understanding of the role of chemical cues in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Animals often use acoustical cues, such as formant frequencies, to assess the size of potential mates and rivals. Reliable vocal cues to size may be under sexual selection. In most mammals and many other vertebrates, formants scale with vocal tract length allometrically and predict variation in size more reliably than fundamental frequency or pitch (F0). In humans, however, it is unclear from previous work how well voice parameters predict body size independently of age and sex. We conducted a meta-analysis to establish the strength of various voice-size relationships in adult men and women. We computed mean weighted correlations from 295 coefficients derived from 39 independent samples across five continents, including several novel and large cross-cultural samples from previously unpublished data. Where possible, we controlled for sample size, sample sex, mean age, geographical location, study year, speech type and measurement method, and ruled out publication bias. Eleven of 12 formant-based vocal tract length (VTL) estimates predicted men's and women's heights and weights significantly better than did F0. Individual VTL estimates explained up to 10% of the variance in height and weight, whereas F0 explained less than 2% and correlated only weakly with size within sexes. Statistically reliable size estimates from F0 required large samples of at least 618 men and 2140 women, whereas formant-based size estimates required samples of at least 99 men and 164 women. The strength of voice-size relationships varied by sample size, and in some cases sex, but was largely unaffected by other demographic and methodological variables. We confirm here that, analogous to many other vertebrates, formants provide the most reliable vocal cue to size in humans.

AB Lean season foraging strategies are critical for the survival of species inhabiting highly seasonal environments such as alpine regions. However, inferring foraging strategies is often difficult because of challenges associated with empirically estimating energetic costs and gains of foraging in the field. We generated qualitative predictions for the relationship between daily winter foraging time, body size and forage availability for three contrasting foraging strategies including time minimization, energy intake maximization and net energy maximization. Our model predicts that for animals employing a time minimization strategy, daily winter foraging time should not change with body size and should increase with a reduction in forage availability. For energy intake maximization, foraging time should not vary with either body size or forage availability. In contrast, for a net energy maximization strategy, foraging time should decrease with increase in body size and with a reduction in forage availability. We contrasted proportion of daily time spent foraging by bharal, Pseudois nayaur, a dimorphic grazer, across different body size classes in two high-altitude sites differing in forage availability. Our results indicate that bharal behave as net energy maximizers during winter. As predicted by the net energy maximization strategy, daily winter foraging time of bharal declined with increasing body size, and was lower in the site with low forage availability. Furthermore, as predicted by our model, foraging time declined as the winter season progressed. We did not find support for the time minimizing or energy intake maximizing strategies. Our qualitative model uses relative rather than absolute costs and gains of foraging which are often difficult to estimate in the field. It thus offers a simple way to make informed inferences regarding animal foraging strategies by contrasting estimates of daily foraging time across gradients of body size and forage availability.

AB The role of ontogenetic processes for the emergence of personality has received only little attention in the past. One reason for the lack of experimental studies on personality development may be that trait consistency over time is one of the cornerstones of the definition of animal personality, whereas, also by definition, ontogeny deals with change over time. Single traits or correlations between traits may be consistent or inconsistent throughout ontogeny; however, the proximate and ultimate causes are not well understood. Environmental factors acting upon individuals during early ontogeny potentially influence personality development substantially. Early environments may severely constrain but also adaptively shape individuals. We examined the personality development of cavies, Cavia aperea, when exposed to increasing and decreasing photoperiod before and after birth. We determined how these predictive environmental cues influenced the development of three behavioural and two physiological traits, their temporal consistency and the correlations between them. We found remarkable plasticity in the development of personality in the cavy, despite a relatively high degree of temporal consistency in most traits. There were stable correlations, some of which became tighter over time, between basal cortisol levels, resting metabolic rate and fearlessness across two different ontogenetic stages. However, we also found that some correlations emerged only after maturation or disappeared over time. Whereas exploration behaviour was tightly correlated with basal cortisol and boldness was correlated with resting metabolic rate, both correlations disappeared in mature animals. Instead, a correlation between exploration and boldness was evident in mature animals. These results call for a broader incorporation of developmental aspects into personality research.

AB Accurate, threat-specific alarm systems might play a role in the evolution of joint-nesting systems by offsetting the high costs associated with joint nesting. The smooth-billed ani, a joint-nesting cooperatively breeding bird, produces at least two distinct classes of vocal alarms. Anis give 'chlurp' calls in response to flying raptorial birds, and they give 'ahnee alarms' in response to terrestrial threats. We used acoustic playback to test free-living anis' responses to these alarm calls. Anis responded to chlurp playback by diving into vegetative cover or flying low along the grass and into cover. These behaviours are appropriate defensive responses to an aerial threat. Anis that perched in low vegetation or on the ground responded to ahnee alarms by flying up to higher perches, an appropriate response to a terrestrial threat. Thus, both calls elicited responses that were appropriate to evade predation in the contexts under which the alarms are typically given. We conclude that smooth-billed anis respond to both chlurp and ahnee alarm calls by taking evasive action consistent with aerial and terrestrial threats, respectively. Even in the absence of an actual threat, the calls alone are sufficient to elicit these responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a cooperatively breeding, joint-nesting species that uses a functionally referential alarm calling system. We hypothesize that direct benefits garnered from this sophisticated alarm system offset some of the fitness costs incurred by joint nesting.

AB Although adaptive traits are commonly assumed to decline when the selection pressures favouring them become relaxed, behavioural adaptations against brood parasitism often persist for long periods in isolation from brood parasites. In cases where declines have been observed, it has been unclear whether the lower expression in parasite-free populations represents genetic change or is due to phenotypic plasticity in trait expression. We experimentally tested two host species of brood-parasitic brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater, for egg rejection behaviour in populations (1) that have bred outside the parasite's range for up to 8000 years, (2) that have been in long-term contact with cowbirds or (3) that are within the cowbird's range but are 'cowbird-naive' because cowbirds do not breed locally. American robins, Turdus migratorius, and grey catbirds, Dumetella carolinensis, breeding in allopatry from cowbirds showed lower responsiveness to cowbird eggs than conspecifics breeding in sympatry with cowbirds. Responses of robins and catbirds in cowbird-naive populations, which have had little or no exposure to cowbirds, were identical to those of conspecifics breeding in the presence of cowbirds, indicating that exposure to cowbirds is not necessary for the full expression of rejection and that this defence shows little or no phenotypic plasticity. Therefore, we conclude that the decline in rejection behaviour of allopatric robins and catbirds reflects genetic change and is not due to phenotypic plasticity.

AB Long-term studies of sociality in wild animals are rare, despite being critical for determining the benefits of social relationships and testing how long such relationships last and whether they change as individuals age. Knowledge about social relationships in animal species that exhibit fission-fusion dynamics can enhance our understanding of the evolution of close social bonds in humans, who also have a fission-fusion social system. We analysed the social network of wild giraffes, Giraffa camelopardalis, in Etosha National Park, Namibia, from 1102 records of group compositions, including 625 individually identified individuals, spanning 6 years. We found that giraffes, which exhibit fission-fusion sociality, formed a cohesive society with short path lengths across the network that may facilitate passive information sharing about resource availability. Male and female giraffes appeared to contribute equally to the network structure, based on similarities between the sexes for five network metrics. However, using lagged association rates, we found that long-term relationships spanning 6 years were evident among female giraffes, but not males, which may be explained by sex differences in ranging patterns and reproductive priorities. Five network metrics of females were compared between two adult age cohorts to investigate whether females' ages influenced sociability. As younger females reached adulthood, they associated with greater numbers of females and increased their network strength and social connectivity, perhaps because of dispersal. Our study reinforces the value of network analysis and long-term studies for examining the social systems of wild animals. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The social structure of a population is a crucial element of an individual's environment, fundamentally influencing the transfer of genes, information and diseases. A central question in social network analysis is how different traits affect associations within populations. However, previous studies of animal social networks have typically focused on a single predictor or stage in the life cycle whereas social interactions within populations are known to be dynamic and not fixed through time and/or context. Relatively few animal network studies have explored how individual traits affect decisions across different ecologically relevant contexts. We collected detailed behavioural data (personality, dominance, familiarity) and high-resolution genetic data from a flock of 43 captive barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, to understand how these traits affect association patterns in two different evolutionary and ecologically highly relevant contexts: foraging and mate choice. Using a novel analytical framework for node label permutations, we found that barnacle geese preferentially associated with close kin and other individuals familiar from earlier in life when foraging, but selected unfamiliar partners during mate choice. We found no effect of either personality or dominance on foraging associations or mate choice. Our study shows how using social network analysis can increase our understanding of the drivers behind population structure (in our case kin selection and inbreeding avoidance). Moreover, our study demonstrates that social networks can be largely determined by long-termprocesses, inparticular early life familiarity. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Discrimination among potential partners is a critical step in sexual selection to avoid wasting reproductive resources on an unsuitable mate. In the female-dominated hymenopteran societies males have often been regarded as 'flying sperm containers' spending all their time and energy in trying to acquire a mate. We investigated the male sexual preference for potential partners using as a model the primitively eusocial wasp Polistes dominula in which female caste is rather flexible and difficult to determine. By means of laboratory bioassays, we compared the males' behaviour towards females of different reproductive potential. Males were able to recognize female castes, strongly preferring reproductive females to workers, regardless of female age or health. The results show that in this species caste plays a key role in orienting male discrimination and preference, presumably through chemical cues, towards reproductive females both healthy and parasite-castrated. Overall, our study shows that social Hymenoptera males are not always 'small mating machines' eager to mate. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Blue tits are famous for the 'milk bottle' innovation, which emerged at numerous sites across Britain in the early 20th century. However, overall we still know little about the factors that foster or hinder the spread of innovations, or of the impact of individual differences in behaviour on social transmission. We used a two-action and control experimental design to study the diffusion of innovation in groups of wild-caught blue tits, and found strong evidence that individuals can use social learning to acquire novel foraging skills. We then measured six individual characteristics, including innovative problem solving, to investigate potential correlates of individual social-learning tendency. Consistent with a hypothesis of common mechanisms underlying both processes, we found evidence for a relationship between social learning and innovativeness. In addition, we observed significant age-and sex-biased social learning, with juvenile females twice as likely to acquire the novel skill as other birds. Social learning was also more likely in subordinate males than dominant males. Our results identify individual variation and transmission biases that have potential implications for the diffusion of innovations in natural populations.

AB To demonstrate adaptive convergent evolution, it must be shown that shared phenotypes have evolved independently in different lineages and that a credible selection pressure underlies adaptive evolution. There are a number of robust examples of adaptive convergence in morphology for which both these criteria have been met, but examples from animal behaviour have rarely been tested as rigorously. Adaptive convergence should be common in behaviour, especially behaviour used for communication, because the environment often shapes the evolution of signal design. In this study we report on the origins of a shared design of a territorial display among Anolis species of lizards from two island radiations in the Caribbean. These lizards perform an elaborate display that consists of a complex series of headbobs and dewlap extensions. The way in which these movements are incorporated into displays is generally species specific, but species on the islands of Jamaica and Puerto Rico also share fundamental aspects in display design, resulting in two general display types. We confirm these display types are convergent (the consequence of independent evolution on each island) and provide evidence that the convergence was driven by selection for enhanced signal efficiency. Our study shows how adaptation to common environmental variables can drive the evolution of adaptive, convergent signals in distantly related species.

AB Theory on animal contests often assumes that individuals can rapidly and accurately assess their own resource-holding potential (RHP). In empirical work, individuals behave as if they 'know' their own RHP, but little is known about how such assessment occurs. Here, we test how juvenile hormone (JH) influences precontest behaviour in P. dominulus paper wasps. Previous work has shown that P. dominulus have variable black facial patterns that are a signal of agonistic ability and that JH influences fighting ability. In this experiment, we tested how JH influences rival challenge behaviour in the absence of direct social competition. Wasps were given the opportunity to challenge or avoid a model wasp guarding a patch of food. Individuals treated with the JH analogue methoprene were more likely to challenge rivals than were control individuals, and they also had a shorter latency to challenge than controls. However, hormone treatment was only one of multiple factors that influenced behaviour, suggesting that assessment prior to contests is based on the interplay between individual physiology and social context. Contest decisions were also dependent on a wasp's own facial pattern and mass, as well as the facial pattern of its rival. Interestingly, these complex assessment decisions occurred in the absence of direct social cues that could be acquired during a contest. These results are consistent with JH playing a role in self-assessment of RHP. Hormones such as JH are influenced by the physical and social environment, so they provide diverse information about relative RHP and may be commonly involved in assessment behaviour.

AB Male secondary sexual traits often comprise multiple components and can function in different contexts. Male signals can target females for mating, males for aggression, and may also function in interspecific interactions. In darter fishes (Percidae: Etheostoma), male nuptial coloration is a multicomponent secondary sexual signal. Females are known to respond to this signal in both intra- and interspecific contexts; they prefer conspecific over heterospecific coloration and prefer a particular colour variant within species. We also have shown that two components of this complex signal (colour and pattern) are each sufficient, in isolation, to attract females. Here, we demonstrate that males also respond to variation in nuptial coloration. Males of two sympatric species showed an association preference for motorized models with conspecific over heterospecific coloration. We also sought to determine whether colour or pattern presides over the other in its influence on female and male behaviour. Using model fish representing conspecific colour (hue) with mismatched heterospecific patterning (and vice versa), we asked whether either sex preferred one element over the other. Female and male Etheostoma barrenense preferred models showing conspecific male coloration in a heterospecific pattern. In contrast, neither male nor female Etheostoma zonale showed a preference for models displaying conspecific colour or conspecific pattern. We speculate that colour may be under stronger sexual selection than pattern in E. barrenense, whereas colour and pattern may be equally important social cues for E. zonale.

AB Billions of wild and semiwild animals live in captive conditions very different from their ancestral environments. Some of the potential challenges they face here, such as greater human proximity, constrained natural behaviours and altered climates, resemble those occurring during urbanization, translocation and other forms of human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC) in the wild. These parallels between HIREC and captivity suggest that certain species could be in double jeopardy: struggling in both wild and captive environments. This raises new hypotheses for future research, including one tested in this paper: that a species' presence in captivity predicts its chances of establishment when translocated to novel natural habitats. Furthermore, understanding the mechanisms that predispose captive populations to thrive or fail can yield new insights into how animals respond to HIREC. For example, populations adjusting to captivity demonstrate rapid developmental effects. Within one generation, captive-reared animals may show beneficial phenotypic changes (e.g. smaller stress responses than F0s wild caught as adults), illustrating how adaptive developmental plasticity can help populations succeed. However, captive-reared animals also illustrate the risks of developing in evolutionarily new environments (being prone to reduced behavioural flexibility, and sometimes impaired reproduction), suggesting that disrupted ontogeny is one reason why HIREC can be harmful. Overall, analogies between captivity and HIREC are thus interesting and useful. However, captivity and HIREC do differ in some regards, captivity tending to be safer yet more monotonous; we therefore end by discussing how species-typical risk/protective factors, and the phenotypic changes induced in affected animals, may vary between the two.

TI Songs of the city: noise-dependent spectral plasticity in the acoustic

AB Urbanization leads to homogenization of avian communities through local extinction of rare bird species and increasing numbers of the same common urban bird species over large geographical areas. Successful city birds often persist through some sort of behavioural plasticity that helps them survive and reproduce close to humans, in built-up areas, with all the typical urban feasts and hazards. In this review, I address whether behavioural plasticity of the acoustic phenotype can be an additional factor in explaining which species end up as urban survivors. Anthropogenic noise has been shown to negatively affect avian distribution and reproduction, especially for species that rely on relatively low-frequency songs for mediating territorial conflicts and attracting partners for mating. Spectral differences between songs of city and forest populations of the same species and correlations between individual song frequency use and local noise levels suggest that many successful city species shift song frequency upward under noisy urban conditions. Experimental evidence has confirmed the ability of several species to show rapid spectral adjustments as well as perceptual benefits of singing at higher frequency in noisy habitats. However, empirical evidence of fitness benefits for birds showing the ability and tendency of noise-dependent spectral adjustment is still lacking. Furthermore, depending on the species and the underlying mechanism for spectral change, there may also be fitness costs through a compromise on signal function. These two aspects are only two of many remaining avenues for future studies. The acoustic phenotype of urban birds provides a great model system to study fundamental processes such as causes and consequences of environmentally induced signal changes, 'cultural assimilation', and the relationship between phenotypic and genotypic evolution. Furthermore, the current and expected rate of urbanization remains high at a global scale, which will lead to further spread in time and space of artificially elevated noise levels. This should guarantee the continued interest of scientists, politicians and conservationists for many years ahead. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Common swifts are specialist flyers spending most of their life aloft, including night-time periods when this species roosts on the wing. Nocturnal roosting is preceded by a vertical ascent in twilight conditions towards altitudes of up to 2.5 km, behaviour previously explained as flight altitude selection for sleeping. We examined the nocturnal flight behaviour of swifts, as uniquely identified by a Doppler weather radar in central Netherlands using continuous measurements during two consecutive breeding seasons. Common swifts performed twilight ascents not only at dusk but also at dawn, which casts new light on the purpose of these ascents. Dusk and dawn ascents were mirror images of each other when time-referenced to the moment of sunset and sunrise, suggesting that the acquisition of twilight-specific light-based cues plays an important role in the progression of the ascents. Ascent height was well explained by the altitude of the 280 K isotherm, and was not significantly related to wind, cloud base height, humidity or the presence of nocturnal insects. We hypothesize that swifts profile the state of the atmospheric boundary layer during twilight ascents and/or attempt to maximize their perceptual range for visual access to distant horizontal landmarks, including surrounding weather. We compare twilight profiling by swifts with vertical twilight movements observed in other taxa, proposed to be related to orientation and navigation.

AB Despite an extensive literature on the role of acoustic cues in mate choice little is known about the specific vocal traits that female mammals prefer. We used resynthesis techniques and playback experiments to examine the behavioural responses of oestrous female koalas, Phascolarctos cinereus, to male bellows in which a specific acoustic cue to body size, the formants, were modified to simulate callers of different body size. Oestrous females looked longer towards, and spent more time in close proximity to, loudspeakers broadcasting bellows simulating larger male koalas. These findings suggest that female koalas use formants (key components of human speech) to select larger males as mating partners, and represent the first evidence of a marsupial mating preference based on a vocal signal. More generally, these results indicate that intersexual selection pressures to lower formants and exaggerate size are present in a marsupial species, raising interesting questions about the evolutionary origins of formant perception.

AB Little is known about the extent to which solitary individuals differ in their social behaviour from group-living ones within the same species. Using the socially flexible African striped mouse, we tested through a series of dyadic encounters in a neutral arena whether group-living mice that later became solitary differed from their philopatric conspecifics. We compared philopatric and solitary mice both before and after dispersal. We predicted striped mice that became solitary would be more aggressive, less amicable and more investigative than individuals that remained group living, and would change their social behaviour after changing from group to solitary living in the same direction (becoming more aggressive, etc.). Dyadic encounters were conducted on 42 group-living individuals and 13 individuals that were first group living and later became solitary. Striped mice that became solitary showed higher levels of aggression and social investigation than their conspecifics that remained group living, differences that were already present before individuals dispersed. Dispersing striped mice showed a negative correlation between amicability and aggression towards opposite-sex individuals, which could be linked to sexual motivation. A second behavioural syndrome in the form of a positive correlation between aggression and social investigation towards same-sex individuals might have indicated that dispersing striped mice were ready to defend their own territory. Our study provides evidence that within the same population and at the same time, individuals that disperse and become solitary differ behaviourally from their group-living conspecifics even before dispersal, and further change their behaviour after dispersal in an evolutionarily adaptive way.

AB The effects of learning have been neglected in studies of sexual selection because previous researchers have assumed, implicitly or explicitly, that sexual behaviour is genetically fixed. To understand the role of learning in sexual selection, it is important to investigate how early experience interacts with adult experience to determine the use of different mating strategies. We explored this interaction by comparing the sexual behaviour of male guppies, Poecilia reticulata, raised in different social environments before and after they gained sexual experience. Males raised with other males performed long courtship displays at first, but decreased their courtship after they had gained sexual experience. However, for males raised only with females, sexual experience did not modify courtship duration. Males raised exclusively with females exhibited high rates of forced copulation attempts in their first encounter with a female, but reduced this behaviour after sexual experience. In contrast, males raised with other males did not modify their forced copulations. Adult sexual experience appeared to mitigate the behavioural differences caused by variation in rearing environment. Sexual experience helps males to find an optimal balance between courtship displays and forced copulation attempts. We also show that more males exhibited male-male aggression after sexual experience if they had social interactions with other males early in life. This study highlights that courtship and other sexual strategies are not fixed, and that several potential sources of variation exist in the development of an animal's sexual behaviour. Importantly, juvenile and adult experiences can interact to shape sexual behaviour in males. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although human activities are known to affect the social behaviour of group-living animals, the resilience of animals' social structure to disturbance is poorly understood. In the 1990s, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Moreton Bay, Australia, formed two distinct social communities ('trawler' and 'nontrawler dolphins') based on foraging interactions (or lack thereof) with commercial prawn trawlers. Members of the two communities almost never associated, despite overlapping home ranges. Since then, changes to fisheries legislation have substantially reduced trawling in Moreton Bay. We used association analyses and social network metrics to compare patterns of sociality among bottlenose dolphins across two periods: 1997-1999 (during trawling) and 2008-2010 (post trawling). Over this decade, their social network became less differentiated and more compact (average geodesic distance between individuals decreased), with significantly more and stronger associations between individuals (mean and maximum half-weight indices increased). The previously described partitioning into two communities has disappeared, with former 'trawler' and 'nontrawler dolphins' now dispersed over the entire social network and associating with each other. This restructuring suggests that although fisheries can influence the social behaviour of bottlenose dolphins, their social structure represents a complex adaptive system that is resilient to disturbance.

AB Assessment of their own resource-holding potential (RHP) and that of their opponent affects the behaviours individuals use in contest competition. Contestants may use their own RHP and/or the relative RHP of opponents to make decisions and may switch these two assessment tactics during fighting. In male-male contests of hermit crabs Pagurus middendorffii, we examined whether contestants switch assessment tactics and whether they assess body size or major cheliped size as an index of RHP. Males of this species show precopulatory guarding behaviour, and male-male contests often occur when males guarding females encounter intruder males. We conducted trials of dyadic contests to investigate the assessment tactics in two phases of the contest: initial and combat. Intruders gave up the contest without escalating to physical combat when they were smaller. When physical combat occurred, it lasted longer if the difference in size of the major cheliped between guarding males and intruders was small, and males with a larger major cheliped than the opponent had a higher probability of winning the contests. These results suggest that P. middendorffii uses its own body size during the initial phase of a contest and relative major cheliped size during the combat phase to assess RHP.

AB The interactions between avian interspecific brood parasites and their hosts provide tractable and informative systems for investigating coevolution. Generally, these investigations have emphasized the egg and chick stages of the coevolutionary arms race; however, recent studies demonstrate that coevolution operates at all stages of the host nesting cycle and emphasize the importance of reciprocal adaptations prior to deposition of the parasite egg in the host nest: the 'frontline' of the arms race. Here we review the diversity of adaptations at the frontline and its implications for our understanding of brood parasite-host relationships. Coevolution at the frontline can fundamentally shape the life histories, morphologies, physiologies and behaviours of both brood parasites and their hosts, and influences the trajectories and outcomes of their subsequent coevolutionary interactions. We advocate the incorporation of frontline interactions in empirical and theoretical investigations of brood parasite-host arms races to provide a more holistic understanding of the coevolutionary processes in these systems.

AB For animal species that forage as cohesive units, communal decisions about when to forage and where to go are necessary to maintain group cohesion. While in some species particular individuals or subgroups emerge as consistent initiators of movement decisions, in others, many different individuals initiate coordinated group movements. Theoretical models and some empirical studies suggest that an animal's nutritional need may explain variable leadership. We investigated what individual characteristics influence the likelihood of initiating group departure in the cooperatively breeding banded mongoose, Mungos mungo. We found that initiation of group departure was highly variable, and not influenced by sex or age of individuals. However, during periods of synchronized breeding, lactating females initiated group departure more often than expected by chance. Experiments to test whether nutritional constraints explained leadership roles revealed that the initiators of group departure were deprived individuals. This suggests that low energetic reserves caused by low foraging success can have an influence on the individuals' likelihood of acting as initiators. However, analysis of weight data showed that initiators had neither a lower body weight than when not initiating nor a more negative weight change than other group members. These findings indicate that besides short-term foraging success, other factors such as high energetic demands during periods of lactation, asymmetries in foraging abilities or investment in cooperative activities between individuals also determine leadership. We conclude that while nutritional constraints can influence initiation of group departure, various effects of individual differences may equally affect leadership roles.

AB Remarkable diversity in behaviour and morphology (phenotypes) are often observed within a species; this diversity can be understood in terms of individuals maximizing their fitness. Based on evidence from studies linking different phenotypes to individual behaviours we hypothesize that discrete colour polymorphism can reflect personality. We tested for such a relationship in a social bird, the Gouldian finch, which shows two major head-colour morphs: red and black. Forty birds of differing head colours were used in five controlled laboratory tests. We found that three of the five tests were repeatable over time, and that bird performance in these tests differed with respect to head colour. Specifically: (1) pairs of red-headed birds were more aggressive than pairs of black-headed birds; (2) black-headed birds approached and touched a novel object quicker than red-headed birds (they were bolder); (3) black-headed birds returned to feed faster following the presentation of a false predator (they were less risk-averse); (4) boldness was positively correlated with risk taking (within the whole sample, within the red-headed birds and trending in the black-headed birds). Together, our results are consistent with our hypothesis that colour polymorphism could be indicative of consistent behavioural differences, and we make a number of predictions about how we expect this to function as a signal in competitive and cooperative (social) contexts.

AB In a wide range of taxa, including baboons, close social bonds seem to help animals cope with stress and enhance long-term reproductive success and longevity. Current evidence suggests that female baboons may benefit from establishing and maintaining highly individuated relationships with a relatively small number of partners. Here, we extend previous work on the stability of female baboons' social relationships in three different ways. First, we assess the stability of females' social relationships in two distinct and geographically distant sites using the same method. Second, we conduct simulations to determine whether females' social relationships were more stable than expected by chance. Third, we examine demographic sources of variance in the stability of close social bonds. At both sites, females' relationships with their most preferred partners were significantly more stable than expected by chance. In contrast, their relationships with less preferred partners were more ephemeral, often changing from year to year. While nearly all females experienced some change in their top partners across time, many maintained relationships with top partners for several years. Females that lived in smaller groups and had more close kin available had more stable social relationships than those that lived in larger groups and had fewer close kin available.

AB Food caching is accompanied by a risk of theft, especially when observers remember cache locations and pilfer them later. This is the case in some corvids, in which cachers have been shown to change their behaviour flexibly to prevent and reduce the quality of information available to observers who might steal their caches, and invalidate information those observers have already obtained. In this 'war of information', strategies that observers use to increase the amount and validity of information about caches have been studied much less. A first step in exploring pilferer strategies is to determine what individuals prefer to watch when observing others. To that end, we allowed western scrub-jays, Aphelocoma californica, to observe either of two cages through peepholes, varying the information available in them in four experimental conditions. We later extracted the number and duration of looks into each peephole and the behaviour of the individuals that were observed through them. Jays spent much more time looking at caching individuals than either at noncaching individuals or at a cage with only a food bowl and caching trays, suggesting the birds prefer to watch caching and cache-related behaviours. Moreover, when we analysed the attention-getting and attention-holding aspects separately, our results suggested that jays are specifically tuned to looking at locations where there is high potential for caching. Improved pilfering success associated with such active information seeking by observers may have forced cachers to evolve better strategies for concealing or invalidating caching information, in a coevolutionary process resulting in the sophisticated strategies some corvids use.

AB Large, solitary, marine predators such as sharks have been observed to aggregate at specific areas. Such aggregations are almost certainly driven by foraging and behavioural strategies making space for diverse spatial organizations. Reef-associated shark species often show strong patterns of site fidelity that could be viewed as a prerequisite for sociality. However, there is limited empirical evidence that such aggregations are driven by intrinsic social factors. Association data for blacktip reef sharks, Carcharhinus melanopterus, were obtained from photoidentification surveys conducted in Moorea coral reefs (French Polynesia). We adapted a social network approach to demonstrate evidence of four main communities and two subcommunities within the population. We confronted the resulting structure with candidate explanatory variables. Sharks formed spatial groups characterized by nonrandom and long-term associations, despite opportunities for social relationships to develop between communities. Sex and length of sharks tended to influence assortment at the population and community levels. Individual space use also explained community structure, although spatial assortment was globally weaker than random expectations, suggesting that observed associations were not an artefact of the sampling design or spatial distribution of individuals. We conclude that the observed grouping patterns not only resulted from passive aggregations for specific resources, but rather the communities developed from an active choice of individuals as a sign of sociability. Individual preferences and adaptation to local conditions, as well as demographic, ecological and anthropogenic factors, may explain the social variability between communities. This suggests that a stable grouping strategy may confer substantial benefits in this marine predator. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Most Drosophila species produce species-specific male courtship song as part of their precopulatory courtship repertoire. Females usually mate most quickly when stimulated with appropriate song. Unusually, males of Drosophila lini and its sibling species sing sine song only during copulation. Sine song frequency is high in D. lini and Drosophila ogumai and lower in Drosophila ohnishii. Drosophila ogumai and D. lini are allopatric, although the range of D. ohnishii may meet or overlap with that of D. ogumai or D. lini. We conducted playback experiments with each species to examine the role of sine song frequency. Copulation duration increased for females of D. lini or D. ogumai when stimulated with high-frequency (240-250 Hz) artificial song and for females of D. ohnishii when stimulated with low-frequency (170-180 Hz) artificial song. This suggests that sine song frequency extends copulation duration in the three species and that species-typical song is more effective. We also examined song frequency in crosses between D. lini and D. ohnishii to assess its genetic control. Analysis of F1 and backcross generations between D. lini and D. ohnishii showed that sine song frequency is mainly due to additive autosomal variation, although a transgressive effect of the X chromosome and maternal or Y-linked effects were also found.

AB Male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, defend group territories, and sometimes injure or kill members of other groups. To test which factors best predict the occurrence and outcomes of intergroup encounters, we analysed 15 years of data on intergroup encounters, party composition, ranging and feeding behaviour in the Kanyawara community of chimpanzees, Kibale National Park, Uganda. During this time, researchers observed 120 intergroup encounters, most of which (85%) involved only acoustic contact. The majority of encounters (63%) occurred in the southeast quadrant of the range. Multiple logistic regression found that intergroup encounters occurred more often when chimpanzees were far from the centre of their range, especially in the south, and when eating foods that were most abundant in the south. Multiple linear regression found that chimpanzees travelled further from the centre of their range, and further south, when eating a few key foods, especially fruits of Uvariopsis congensis, and when in parties with more males. Upon hearing calls from foreign chimpanzees, Kanyawara chimpanzees were more likely to vocalize in response, and to travel towards the foreign chimpanzees, when they had more males in their party. Measures of two resource values, food and mates, were negatively correlated with the probability of vocalizing and approaching intruders, respectively. These findings indicate that, in this population, resources affect the timing of intergroup encounters, but the decision to escalate a contest depends mainly on numerical strength, rather than the value of resources being contested.

AB Many insects migrate at high altitudes where they utilize fast-flowing airstreams for long-distance transport. Nocturnal insect migrants typically exhibit a strongly unimodal distribution of flight headings (a phenomenon termed 'common orientation'), and the mean heading is often aligned downwind. In addition, these nocturnal migrants are sometimes concentrated into shallow altitudinal zones (termed 'layers'). The mechanism by which widely separated insects select and maintain common flight headings had until recently eluded explanation, but recent theoretical advances have shown that atmospheric turbulence might enable insects to perceive the downwind direction and orient accordingly. This theory predicts that common orientation downwind should be: (1) widespread in nocturnal insect migrants; (2) facilitated when insects are concentrated into layers; and (3) more pronounced in larger insects. We tested these ideas using radar observations of 647 independent nocturnal migration events, and found strong support for all three predictions: (1) common orientation occurred in 75-90% of events; (2) common orientation was more frequent, had significantly less scatter and was significantly closer to downwind when insects migrated in layers; and (3) large insects exhibited significantly tighter orientation than 'medium-sized' insects. Our results provide robust evidence that wind-related common orientation is mediated by detection of atmospheric turbulence. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) are an important part of multimodal communication in mice; however, nothing is known about the behavioural context of USV production by individual mice in the wild. Using remote-sensing methods we recorded USVs from individual adult free-living Peromyscus californicus. Because adult male and female P. californicus share duties in rearing offspring and defending territories, we predicted that male and female P. californicus would produce USVs in similar behavioural contexts and with similar spectral and temporal characteristics. We found that adult male and female P. californicus produced USVs, with the most common motifs being one-, two-and three-syllable vocalizations. USVs of males and females did not differ significantly in type or number, or in spectral or temporal characteristics. Peromyscus californicus produced USVs when alone and when they were with another mouse, and the three-syllable vocalization (3SV) motif, which has a relatively long first syllable, was more likely to be produced in the presence of another mouse than when a mouse was alone. The likelihood of vocalizing and the spectral and temporal characteristics of vocalizations did not differ when an individual was producing a USV in the presence of a mate or nonmate. Males and females produced USVs in the same behavioural contexts. Thus, as with other behaviours associated with parenting and territorial defence in P. californicus, USVs of males and females are produced in similar behavioural contexts and have similar spectral and temporal characteristics.

AB In polygynous systems, female aggregation may affect the degree of polygyny by increasing the variance in male mating success. However, other population features such as the sex ratio and the age structure of males may also affect the distribution of male mating success. We combined behavioural observations and genetic data to investigate the relationship between spatial distribution, population structure and degree of polygyny in 30 red deer, Cervus elaphus, populations in Spain. We found that although female aggregation was positively related to mean harem size, under conditions of high female aggregation males were unable to monopolize whole female groups. The relationships between female aggregation and behavioural estimates of the variance in male mating success were strongly influenced by the sex ratio and the proportion of competitive males in the population. Potential skew of male mating success and potential opportunity for sexual selection were higher in adults than in young or subadult males. Finally, the behaviourally estimated distribution of male mating success matched the genetically estimated degree of polygyny, especially under conditions of relatively high synchrony in female receptivity. Our results show how population structure can interact with female aggregation in space and time to influence the opportunity for sexual selection in red deer.

AB Within-group power asymmetries and the resulting reproductive skew, common in most social groups, may effectively be set at the very early stages of group formation, that is, when group membership is determined. Hence, groupmate choices can define an individual's future reproductive success. We examined how groups of Polistes dominulus formed under natural, unconstrained conditions, using data on the nesting history, kinship and morphology of individually marked foundresses obtained during two consecutive seasons in southern Spain. Foundresses that hibernated in the same aggregation were more likely to start a nest together, but all of the foundresses at a nest were seldom from a single aggregation. Changes in group composition were frequent throughout the preworker period, mainly because some foundresses disappeared and other wasps joined established groups. Within-group relatedness, however, was not affected by the late arrival of wasps. Our results suggest that waiting to join an established group is a common nesting strategy in P. dominulus. Only 16% of marked wasps used more than one nest. Foundresses that moved between groups tended to move to groups in which genetic relatedness among the resident foundresses was higher, but not necessarily relatedness to the moving wasp herself. Overall, nestmate choices were not associated with a single factor. High failure rates, particularly of single-foundress nests, however, suggest that ecological constraints (e. g. risk of predation, lack of resources) may have a stronger effect on individual nesting choices than previously considered.

AB Duetting behaviour is a unique form of animal communication that occurs in many diverse taxa in the animal kingdom. Hypotheses for the function of duets can be grouped into two broad categories to explain why individuals coordinate with their partner's songs to create duets: (1) duets are cooperative displays where pair members have a shared goal, such as joint resource defence, and (2) duets are conflicting displays where pair members have different goals, such as guarding against divorce or extrapair copulations. To distinguish between cooperative versus conflicting functions of vocal duets, we conducted a playback experiment to 40 breeding pairs of barred antshrikes, Thamnophilus doliatus. We broadcast five playback treatments to territorial pairs of birds: solos of males and females, duets created by males responding to female songs and by females responding to male songs, and a heterospecific control. We categorized subjects' behaviour in terms of vocal and physical responses. Male vocal and physical responses were significantly higher towards conspecific stimuli than towards heterospecific stimuli. Males tended to show more vocal responsiveness towards duet stimuli, although this tendency was not significant. We observed a similar pattern for female vocal responses. However, for physical responses, females showed significantly more intense responses towards female solo stimuli than towards any other conspecific treatment, suggesting that female antshrikes perceive rival females as an especially intense threat. Our results provide some support for a joint resource defence function for duetting in this species, while the high intrasexual aggression observed between females may indicate a form of mate guarding.

AB In species showing delayed natal dispersal, broodmates vary in natal dispersal timing and strategy, where some choose to disperse early while others delay. In the cooperatively breeding red-cockaded woodpecker, Picoides borealis, typically only one juvenile male per brood delays dispersal despite the lifetime fitness benefits associated with delayed dispersal. We sought to determine whether adult favouritism or intrabrood competition over the distribution of natal food resources provides a mechanism for the persistence of individual variation in natal dispersal strategies. We show that fledgling red-cockaded woodpeckers form male-biased, linear dominance hierarchies as a result of frequent aggressive conflicts. For males, high nestling condition relative to male broodmates was a strong predictor of future dominance, and this condition-rank relationship persisted after individuals reached nutritional independence. Adults were never observed interfering with broodmate conflicts, and were only rarely aggressive towards fledglings. Adults showed no overt favouritism towards offspring when targeting individual fledglings during provisioning early in the postfledging period. However, conflict rates increased with decreasing targeted-feeding rates, suggesting that access to resources is an important function of dominance hierarchies. After fledglings were developmentally able to compete for positions near foraging adults, first-and second-ranking males were fed more often than subordinate females. Of the juvenile males surviving to spring, subordinates were more likely to disperse during their first year than were their dominant broodmates. Together, our findings suggest that for young red-cockaded woodpeckers, intrabrood social rank provides a mechanism for prioritized access to natal resources and variation in natal dispersal strategy.

AB Many group-living animals show social preferences for relatives, familiar conspecifics or individuals of similar attributes such as size, personality or sex. How such preferences could affect the collective motion of animal groups has been rather unexplored. We present a general model of collective animal motion that includes social connections as preferential reactions between individuals. Our conceptual examples illustrate the possible impact of underlying social networks on the collective motion of animals. Our approach shows that the structure of these networks could influence: (1) the cohesion of groups; (2) the spatial position of individuals within groups; and (3) the hierarchical dynamics within such groups. We argue that the position of individuals within a social network and the social network structure of populations could have important fitness implications for individual animals. Counterintuitive results from our conceptual examples show that social structures can result in unexpected group dynamics. This sharpens our understanding of the way in which collective movement can be interpreted as a result of social interactions. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB An individual's fitness is estimated by its lifetime reproductive success. In the polygynandrous sciurid mating system, male reproductive success is determined by an individual's success in locating and defending receptive females. Personality traits are differences in behavioural reactions that are heritable, consistent across contexts and over time, and may have important fitness consequences. Little research has been conducted on the effect of personality on success in the competition for mates. We examined the relationship between behavioural traits, parasite load and male reproductive success (the number of offspring sired in one year) in the eastern chipmunk. We expected that behavioural traits would affect male reproductive success either directly, through their effect on success in locating and/or defending females, or indirectly, through their effect on parasite load. We measured trappability, activity level/exploratory behaviour, struggle rate and ecto-and endoparasite load. Eighty-two chipmunks (29 adult males, 24 adult females, 29 juveniles) were genotyped to determine paternity. Assuming that trappability is an indicator of boldness, we found that bolder males had more offspring when controlling for endoparasite load. Moreover, bolder males had a higher endoparasite load, caused either by depleted energy reserves or the immunosuppressive effects of testosterone. We conclude that boldness affects reproductive success both directly and indirectly (via parasite load) in male chipmunks; however, there appears to be a trade-off between the positive direct effect and the negative indirect effect on reproductive success.

AB Personality differences (i.e. consistent between-individual differences in behaviour) play an important role in the lives of humans and other animals, influencing both their day-to-day actions and their long-term reproductive success. For organisms living in highly structured groups of related individuals, such as colonies of social insects, personalities could also emerge at the group level. However, while numerous recent studies have investigated individual-level personality, the phenomenon of collective personality in animal groups has received little attention. In this paper, we apply the concept of collective personality to colonies of honeybees (Apis mellifera). We document the presence of consistent differences among colonies across a wide range of collective behaviours and demonstrate a link between colony-level personality traits and fitness. The colonies in our study showed consistent behavioural differences in traits such as defensive response, foraging activity and undertaking, and several of these traits were correlated as part of a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, some of these traits were strongly tied to colony productivity and winter survival. Our results show that the concept of collective personality is applicable to colonies of social insects, and that personality differences among colonies can have important consequences for their long-term survival and reproduction. Applying the concept of personality to close-knit animal groups can provide important insights into the structure of behavioural variability in animal populations and the role that consistent between-group behavioural differences play in the evolution of behaviour.

AB Contact calls function to coordinate movements in a wide variety of social animals. Where population density is high, visibility is low and repeated interactions occur between known social companions, calls are often individually recognizable. Parrots are highly social and make substantial daily movements, which appear to be mediated through contact calling. However, there is little experimental evidence for how free-ranging parrots recognize social companions. We quantified intra-and interindividual variation of contact calls in a banded population of green-rumped parrotlets in Venezuela. Recordings of a sample of males were made on replicate days as they announced their return to incubating mates. Spectrographic structure of these contact calls showed significantly more variation between than within individuals, and calls could be correctly classified to individuals more often than was expected by chance. Males varied across multiple dimensions simultaneously, including duration, frequency and frequency modulation of contact calls. Playback experiments showed that free-ranging female parrotlets responded significantly more often to their mates' calls than to calls of males of other nests. Mate recognition via contact calls may be selectively advantageous during incubation and brooding if this reduces the potential costs associated with confusing contact calls of mates with those of nonmates, including infanticidal conspecifics.

AB Overmarking occurs when one individual places its scent mark directly on top of the scent mark of another individual. Although it is almost ubiquitous among terrestrial mammals, we know little about the function of overmarking and detailed field observations are rare. We investigated the chemical composition of scents and patterns of overmarking by wild banded mongooses, Mungos mungo. Chemical analyses of anal gland secretions showed that scents were sexually dimorphic. Both male and female adults were more likely to overmark the scents of same-sex individuals. An analysis of responses to two scents on the same site suggested that the sex of the top or most recent scent was more important than that of the bottom or original scent in determining overmarking response. Juveniles also overmarked scents at high rates, but did not respond to scents in a sex-specific way. Same-sex-specific patterns within groups have not been described in any other species, and may reflect a social system with intense intrasexual competition for reproduction within both sexes. Banded mongooses live in large mixed-sex groups, with intense competition between males for females, owing to the heavily male-biased adult sex ratio and highly synchronized oestrous cycles. Oestrous synchronization may also promote intrasexual competition for males within females, as females compete simultaneously for high-quality males. Female competition for males may also be enhanced by the rewards of male-biased parental care. This investigation highlights the need for detailed studies of overmarking in the natural context, to confirm and expand upon laboratory findings.

AB Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, help others in a variety of contexts. Some researchers have claimed that this only occurs when food is not involved and the recipient actively solicits help. In the current study, however, we found that chimpanzees often helped conspecifics obtain food in a pulling task with no solicitation whatsoever, in a situation in which, based on past experience, the conspecific's desire for the food was apparent. We also assessed whether the collaborative context of the situation impacted helping rates. Specifically, we compared how often both partners obtained rewards when one partner needed the help of the other, who had already received a reward for free (helping without collaboration), and when one partner needed the other's help after they had already begun collaborating (helping during collaboration). Partners provided assistance significantly more often in both of these helping conditions than in a control condition in which partners could provide unneeded help. However, unlike human children who have been tested in a similar task, chimpanzees did not help their partner more during (than without) collaboration. These results suggest that chimpanzees' helping behaviour is more robust than previously believed, but at the same time may have different evolutionary roots from the helping behaviour of humans.

AB The tendency for females to have synchronous or asynchronous ovarian cycles has been reported in several species, including hamadryas baboons, Papio h. hamadryas. Both fitness benefits and costs have been postulated for each condition; however, these remain to be demonstrated. Moreover, uncertainty remains about whether these ovarian cycle patterns are 'real' or an artefact of sampling and statistical design. We used a null model incorporating a bootstrap randomization procedure to examine whether ovarian cycles were more synchronous or asynchronous than expected by chance in a large captive hamadryas colony. Male contraception meant that all female colony members underwent repeated ovarian cycling throughout the 1-year study. No pairing or group of females had synchronous or asynchronous ovarian cycles. Rather, females oscillated between pseudosynchronous and pseudoasynchronous states, because ovarian cycle length varied between and within females. We outline why the absence of synchrony and asynchrony and variation in cycle length in this and other studies are explicable when one considers (1) the brief ovarian cycle bouts typical of natural fertility populations and (2) the type of synchrony or asynchrony measures that were employed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while variation in ovarian cycle length appears to be ubiquitous among animals with these cycles, this does not rule out the possibility of synchrony and asynchrony occurring in natural fertility populations. Further research on this phenomenon in hamadryas and other species is justified, therefore, albeit with a focus on natural fertility populations and employing null-model techniques similar to that used here.

AB Few studies of kinship in mammalian societies have been able to consider the complex interactions between home range overlap, association patterns and kinship, which have created a critical gap in our understanding of social evolution. We investigated the association patterns of female bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia and found that they depended upon the complex interplay of at least three factors: home range overlap, matrilineal kinship and biparental kinship. While home range overlap was positively correlated with female association patterns, preferred associations were found between females showing as little as 27% home range overlap, and some pairs showed avoidance despite 100% home range overlap. Furthermore, on average, both casual and preferred associations took place between females that were more closely biparentally related than expected by chance and this pattern varied depending upon whether or not pairs of females shared the same matriline.

AB Prompt natal dispersal and reproduction of offspring is viewed as the strategy to maximize lifetime reproductive success. Yet, across many species, offspring remain with their parents after independence rather than disperse. Why some species live in family groups and the behavioural mechanisms influencing the extent of family living remain unresolved. Family living is predicted to arise through slow life history traits predisposing certain lineages to family living, and then through social and ecological factors resulting in greater benefits of remaining with parents compared to dispersing. We studied family living in the western slaty-antshrike, Thamnophilus atrinucha, a bird with a slow life history, in Panama. We quantified the extent of delayed dispersal, and examined both the behavioural mechanisms influencing dispersal as well as the survival consequences. We observed that delayed dispersal increased offspring survival. Parental aggression towards offspring increased with offspring age and, in particular, when parents renested. Thus, offspring dispersed earlier when their parents renested. Fledging date and mass of offspring also influenced timing of dispersal. Although we observed higher survival of delayed dispersers, only a small proportion of offspring delayed dispersal until the next year and all dispersed to wander within other breeding pairs' territories ( i.e. 'float'). Our results support theoretical predictions stating that benefits to parents from offspring retention decrease with offspring age and with renesting, leading to natal dispersal. Furthermore, we observed a reduced survival benefit of retention once offspring reached a certain age. Examining parental tolerance, the costs of floating, and how they vary with offspring age are essential to understand the costs/benefits of family living.

AB In mammals, females are the main caretakers of offspring. In a number of species, however, males also care for young, and may spend considerable time with infants. In various nonhuman primates, male interactions with infants appear to benefit mainly the males, who use them to regulate their relationships, particularly with other male group members. We studied whether interactions with infants were related to glucocorticoid output in male Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, at the enclosure 'La Foret des Singes', France. We used a combination of behavioural observations, social network analysis and measures of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites as an indicator of physiological stress, and compared the results for the birth season in spring, during a time of intense interactions with infants, with a period in autumn, when males interacted less frequently with infants. Social network analyses revealed that infant carriers had stronger ties with other males than noncarriers. Overall, male relationships were stronger in spring than in autumn. Infant care was unevenly distributed among males and not related to rank, suggesting that the motivation to invest in infant carrying depends on the position in the social network and the current constellation of relationships. Despite the correlation of infant carrying with male interactions, the time spent with infants alone explained most of the variation in glucocorticoid levels, suggesting that access to the male-male network is paid for by an increase in stress hormone levels. Taken together, these results show that Barbary macaque infants can be viewed as costly social tools that facilitate networking among males.

AB A traditional way to quantify synchronous interactions between animals has been to use concordance indices, which commonly do not take into account the effects of the length of the sampling time and of behaviour driven by third parties. We overcame these issues by casting the process of investigating behavioural interactions into a network inference methodology. We summarized multivariate time series using a complex network whose construction depends on a surrogate hypothesis testing data analysis of synchronous interactions between animals. The method accounts for the effect of third parties on pairwise comparisons, allows one to test the effect of the size of the sampling window on the interactions between animals, and allows one to test behavioural models of increasing complexity. We used a continuous 1-month behavioural data set of the foraging activity of a mixed-sex group of 40 Soay sheep, Ovis aries. We uncovered underlying patterns of behavioural interaction between individual sheep by applying our inferential approach to the symbolic multivariate time series of activity, that is grazing, not grazing. Our findings clearly indicate that animals of the same sex are more synchronized than animals of different sex independent of body size. We advocate that the method proposed is more general and more efficient at detecting patterns of synchronization than traditional concordance indices. We provide the reader with a comprehensive software toolbox to apply the methodology proposed. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In animal contests selection should favour information gathering regarding the likely costs and benefits of continued conflict, and displays may provide a means for contestants to gain information about the fighting ability or aggressive intent of competitors. However, there is debate over the reliability of such displays and low levels of deception may occur within otherwise honest signalling systems. Hermit crabs use displays involving the chelipeds during agonistic encounters. We examined how variation in chelae size in relation to body size, a determinant of fighting ability, affects their use in displays and the process and outcome of contests over gastropod shells. In accordance with deceptive use of an otherwise honest signal, we found that contestants with large chelipeds for their body size spent more time performing the cheliped presentation display. Moreover, cheliped residuals and displays influenced the escalation level of encounters. There was a positive association between cheliped displays and the occurrence of 'grappling', but a negative association between displays and the occurrence of shell fights, suggesting that displays may signal aggressive intent and a reluctance to back off or accept the more passive defender role in a fight. Furthermore, the smaller of the two contestants in shell fights had larger cheliped residuals compared to those smaller contestants not involved in shell fights, which is consistent with disrupted opponent assessment. This study adds to mounting evidence that when acting as a signaller, individuals for whom the display exaggerates competitive ability attempt to manipulate opponents, using the display more often.

AB Poaching removed adult female elephants, Loxodonta africana, from a social system centred on kin support and female philopatry, creating a natural experiment in many matrifocal African elephant populations. We hypothesized that core groups lacking kin display less cohesion and cooperate and compete with elephants outside of their core group more frequently compared to more discriminating genetically intact core groups. We collected behavioural data on 77 known elephant core groups in Mikumi National Park, Tanzania, across three dry seasons (2003-2005) via focal group and scan sampling during transect and waterhole surveys. Pairwise relatedness was derived by genotyping females at 10 microsatellite loci. We categorized core groups as having low relatedness if their relatedness fell 1 SD below a simulation-generated threshold value; otherwise, they were considered to be highly related. We analysed indexes of cohesion, tolerance, affiliation and agonism to determine the influence of core group composition on the frequency of these behaviours. Cohesion, measured by a proximity index, was primarily driven by the actions of young adult females and was greater in core groups with an old matriarch. Between core groups, tolerance was the most frequent response. Core groups of low-related individuals displayed a higher frequency of affiliation and agonism with other unrelated core groups than did highly related core groups. Thus, less discriminating social behaviour may enable individuals that lack kin to avoid the risks of solitary foraging. However, this comes with the cost of increased agonism, potentially leading to negative consequences for these elephants. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Female mate preference can have important fitness consequences for females through direct or indirect benefits of mate choice. However, the existence and benefits of mate choice in species that perform dissociated sperm transfer is largely unknown. In the springtail Orchesella cincta, receptive females locate and take up spermatophores deposited in the litter layer by males, without even meeting their partner. We investigated female sexual selection and its benefits in O. cincta. We performed female choice trials with manipulated spermatophore density and diversity to assess female preference for different spermatophore deposition patterns. Furthermore we tested whether females benefit from choosing between spermatophores by measuring several reproductive variables of females assigned to single male (no choice) and double male (choice) mating treatments. Our results show that females chose patches with four spermatophores over patches with a single spermatophore, but did not discriminate between patches of three spermatophores from a single male or from three different males. The mating experiment showed that O. cincta females gained indirect benefits from choosing between spermatophores of different males, because male offspring resulting from the double male treatment produced more spermatophores than the male offspring from females without a choice. No evidence was found for direct benefits of female choice, because there were no differences in clutch size, egg size or offspring survival between treatments. Despite the large number of studies on female mate choice, this is the first time that indirect benefits have been demonstrated in a species with dissociated sperm transfer.

AB Birds that forage by probing in sand, soil or mud substrates must often use senses other than vision to find their prey. Kiwis (Apterygidae) are nocturnal probing birds inhabiting forested areas in New Zealand. Their visual sense is reduced, but they have a highly developed sense of smell, a bill tip organ similar to that found in Scolopacidae shorebirds, which may be used to detect vibrotactile cues produced by burrowing prey (remote touch), and prominent ear openings. We designed a foraging experiment presenting mealworm prey to eight captive North Island brown kiwis, Apteryx mantelli, under a variety of trial conditions to discover whether they were using hearing, olfaction, remote touch or direct touch (chance alone), singly or together, to find prey. Kiwis were most efficient at finding prey using olfaction alone or in combination with other cues, but switched to locating prey with lower efficiency using remote touch, in the absence of olfactory cues. They did not appear to use auditory cues for foraging. The ability to switch between sensory modalities depending on the quality of the cues available has been documented before in other groups of birds (including thrushes (Turdidae) and sandpipers (Scolopacidae)) and would be of great advantage to wild kiwis foraging under a wide range of environmental conditions.

AB Because parental investment for multiple offspring often proves insufficient, diverse taxa have evolved systems for reducing family size secondarily. We found brood reduction to be common (42% of 1000 nesting cycles) in Oklahoma house sparrows, Passer domesticus, especially when families of four or more nestlings were furnished with less food. Whereas deliveries of large-bodied prey have been shown previously to predict long-term survival of nestlings ( to breeding age), smaller prey items appear adequate for short-term survival ( to. edging). Parents did not prune deliveries in the aftermath of brood reduction, thereby bestowing a likely food bonus on surviving siblings. Individual male and female parents that were observed for multiple nesting cycles produced similar measures of day 11 offspring mass ( including largest chick, smallest chick, and brood mean). By contrast, an index of overall sibling mass inequality was not repeatable. Parents skewed food deliveries towards the larger members of relatively passive day 3 broods, probably influencing early mortality: median age for brood reduction was day 4 posthatching. Patterns of allocation that can be inferred from mass inequities of older chicks ( on day 11) also pointed to persistently skewed deliveries; nestlings underweight at that age were more likely to die without. edging. Large broods early in the season tended to have nestlings less equally sized than broods late in the season, whereas small broods showed no such season effect. Brood reduction appears advantageous to parents if surviving offspring thereby increase prefledging mass sufficiently to compensate for the drop in numbers.

AB The activity patterns for most animals are determined through a trade-off among competing processes, such as foraging behaviour, predator or competitor avoidance, and maintaining bioenergetic efficiency. We used active and passive acoustic telemetry to examine what processes may contribute to diel and seasonal patterns of vertical movement in 27 sixgill sharks in Puget Sound, WA, U.S.A., from December 2005 to December 2007. We found clear and consistent patterns of diel activity; sixgill sharks were typically shallower and more active at night than during the day. In Elliott Bay, WA, sixgill sharks made direct vertical movements at sunrise and sunset, while vertical movements were more variable in deeper, main channel waters. The greatest rates of ascent and descent in sixgill sharks occurred most often during night-time ebb tides. Seasonally, sixgill sharks occupied deeper habitats during the autumn and winter than during spring and were most active in the autumn. We also found synchronous vertical movements in three of four shark pairs tracked simultaneously, evidence that these sharks were responding to similar stimuli. Clear and consistent patterns of diel activity throughout the year across size and sex of sharks and across multiple spatial scales is most consistent with the hypothesis that foraging behaviour is responsible for the patterns of diel vertical movement of sixgill sharks in Puget Sound.

AB To evaluate the two most widely accepted mechanisms of kin recognition, prior association and phenotype matching, we studied kin discrimination in the South American hystricognath rodent Octodon degus. We first assessed differential treatment towards kin during paired encounters in an experimental arena (experiment 1). In addition, we used the habituation technique to investigate odour kin discrimination (experiment 2). In both experiments the relative influence of familiarity and phenotypic similarity were assessed using familiar and unfamiliar siblings, half siblings and genetically unrelated individuals. The results showed that O. degus treat conspecifics differentially as a function of familiarity; young reared apart were equally likely to explore each other independently of genetic relatedness. However, the exploratory behaviour of siblings reared apart and siblings reared together did not differ (experiment 1). On the other hand, degus did discriminate between odours of siblings, half siblings and unrelated individuals reared apart, and between odours of unrelated individuals reared together. Subjects did not discriminate between scents of their siblings reared together with them (experiment 2). These results suggest that familiarity is important in the interaction between animals and in the discrimination of conspeci. c scents. Nevertheless, our results suggest that phenotypic similarity may also influence social interactions and scent discrimination, although only between close kin, hence possibly influencing communal nesting. We propose that no single mechanism exclusively explains kin discrimination in degus. The prior association recognition mechanism mediated most instances of kin recognition, but phenotype matching is also used in close kin discrimination.

AB Studies of learning have consistently shown that animals form strong associations between aversive events, such as a predatory attack, and the environments in which those events are experienced. Place learning through direct exposure to threat puts the individual at a risk that may be avoided, however, by remembering the location in which encounters between conspecifics and dangerous events are observed. Despite much theoretical work predicting that individuals should rely less on private information and more on public information as the risk of individual assessment increases, there have been no tests of observational spatial memory for potentially dangerous places. We investigated whether Indian mynahs learn about an area in which they observe another individual experience an aversive event, namely capture by a human. Experimental observers watched a human chase, catch and remove a conspecfic from a feeding site in which observers were accustomed to feeding. A control group watched a human perform the same capture gestures, but with no mynah present. Analysis of observer behaviour at the feeding site both before and after observational training revealed that experimental observers locomoted more after training than before, relative to control observers, suggesting that mynahs acquired a fear response after watching a predatory attack on a conspecific. It appears that, in addition to learning about the location in which aversive events are experienced directly, animals learn about an environment in which they observe others encounter dangerous events.

AB When encountering food, chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, and some other primates produce specific calls, whose acoustic structure covaries with the caller's food preference. For chimpanzees, there is evidence that listeners use these contingencies to guide their own foraging behaviour. Here, we investigated the vocal behaviour of another great ape, the bonobo, Pan paniscus, in response to food. We were able to distinguish acoustically five different call types given during interactions with food. These calls were not given singly, but usually as part of long and complex call sequences. We established the food preference hierarchies for 10 different individuals, housed at two different facilities. We found that the composition of call sequences produced by these individuals was not random, but was related to the type of food encountered by the caller. Significant variation in call composition was explained by taking into account the caller's individual food preferences, suggesting that bonobo food-calling sequences convey meaningful information to other group members.

AB Social learning and innovation are two different ways to acquire novel behaviours, and the form of the relationship between these two processes strongly affects cultural evolution. Whereas modelling results suggest a negative correlation between the two processes within a species, comparative data show, and the cultural intelligence hypothesis predicts, positive covariation across species. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty about the form of the relationship between social learning and innovation. We explored this problem experimentally in common marmosets. Social learning of 18 subjects was assessed by presenting a video clip of a conspecific demonstrator solving a complex foraging task and comparing their success to a control group. For the same subjects, the propensity to innovate was assessed with two tasks that operationalize different types of innovation: (1) a multistage problem-solving task to estimate goal-directed Type I innovation, that is, the ability to find a solution to a novel problem or a novel solution to an old problem, and (2) a flexibility task testing for more incidental Type II innovation, that is, the propensity to realize and switch to a novel, but easier solution after the establishment of a well-learned solution. Social learning was negatively correlated with Type II innovation, but not with Type I innovation. We discuss these results with regard to competition within an individual of the various attentional processes aimed at conspecifics' behaviour or aspects of the environment, and whether they might be the result of the cooperative breeding system shared by humans and callitrichids.

AB Many animal signals, especially those important to finding and attracting mates, are multimodal, which means they involve two or more sensory modalities. Among other sensory modalities, the wolf spider, Pardosa milvina (Araneae, Lycosidae), uses a variety of chemical and visual information in reproductive activities. Here we report the results of four laboratory experiments in which we explored the effects of visual and chemical information on the behaviour of males. First we established that chemical cues enabled males to find females and that visual cues kept the males' attention focused in the area of the females. Subsequently, we examined the separate and combined effects of visual and chemical cues on the interactions between males competing for virgin or mated females. The behaviour of interacting males revealed that either chemical or visual information was sufficient for them to discriminate between mated and virgin females. Chemical cues elicited more courtship activity and more intense aggressive interactions between males than visual cues. When males were able to see live mated females but were in contact with chemical cues from virgins, aggression was lower and, conversely, when males were able to see live virgin females but were in contact with chemical cues from mated females, aggression increased. We conclude that chemical cues provided males with the most critical discriminatory information. Although the two types of signals are largely redundant, there are some circumstances where they enhance the response of the males and there is an intersignal interaction that allows males to adjust their behaviour when presented with a receptive female.

AB As in most social groups, agonistic interactions of various intensities are common in a goose flock. This may cause social stress, modulating heart rate (HR), which may serve as a measure of energetic investment and also of individual emotional involvement. We investigated HR responses to social encounters in 24 free-living greylag geese in an intact social environment. We recorded 1602 social interactions of various intensities in which the focal individual either attacked another member of the flock or was attacked itself. We analysed five HR parameters (mean HR, maximum HR, HR increase, duration until maximum, time until the baseline value was reached again). Generally, HR scaled positively with increasing intensity of agonistic interactions as well as with increasing duration. Individuals showed higher HRs when attacking than when being attacked. In addition, focal individuals responded with a greater HR increase when confronted with an opponent winning a higher percentage of interactions than itself. Repeated agonistic interactions against a specific opponent were related to greater HR responses than single events and focal individuals responded more strongly to male opponents than to females. Our results indicate a differential HR response depending on the intensity and duration of an interaction as well as the identity of the opponent. This differential physiological investment may reflect differences in emotional involvement depending on the social context of a particular agonistic interaction.

ID HOMO
AB Yawning is a widespread behavioural response expressed in all classes of vertebrates. There is, however, little agreement on its biological significance. One current hypothesis states that yawning serves as a thermoregulatory mechanism that occurs in response to increases in brain and/or body temperature. The brain-cooling hypothesis further stipulates that, as ambient temperature increases and approaches ( but does not exceed) body temperature, yawning should increase as a consequence. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 20 budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus, through the manipulation of room temperature. Birds were exposed to three separate conditions ( control temperature ( 22 degrees C), increasing temperature ( 22-34 degrees C), and high temperature ( 34-38 degrees C)) in a repeated measures design, with each condition lasting 21 min. The incidence of yawning differed significantly across conditions ( 4.20 +/- 2.39 yawns per bird in the increasing temperature condition, compared to 2.05 +/- 1.90 and 1.25 +/- 0.72 yawns per bird, in the high temperature and control conditions, respectively). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that yawning serves a thermoregulatory function. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Colonies of the ponerine army ant Leptogenys distinguenda are regularly inhabited by a highly diverse symbiont fauna including insects, spiders, mites, crustaceans and even molluscs. Each of these myrmecophiles has adapted in a highly specific way to the lifestyle of its host. We studied this diverse myrmecophile fauna of L. distinguenda as a new model for multispecies parasitism to gain a better understanding of fundamental coevolutionary processes. Our study focused on behavioural and on chemical integration and exploitation strategies of the different symbiont species. In addition, we examined potential counterstrategies of the host ant. Myrmecophiles were studied both in large free-living L. distinguenda colonies and in more detail in parts of colonies separated for observation. We found that at least five myrmecophile species imposed cost on their host by exploiting its resources. Their impact varied considerably depending on both the type of resources exploited and their abundance. Myrmecophile species were well integrated into host societies either by chemical mimicry of host cuticular hydrocarbons or by remaining chemically insignificant, lacking most characteristic recognition cues. Despite these chemical integration strategies, host ants were able to recognize and kill the alien intruders to various degrees. This important finding demonstrates that symbiont populations are actively counter-regulated by the host. By constructing a host-parasite interaction network, we finally suggest that host defences can maintain myrmecophile diversity by keeping parasite populations small. This reduces interguild competition, comparable to top-down effects of predators on lower trophic levels in ecological food webs. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Animal signalling contests are used by males to advertise to choosy females and to repel male competitors. During countersinging interactions in songbirds, males vary the type and timing of songs with respect to their opponent's behaviour. In black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, frequency matching and song overlapping appear to be important in territory defence and mate attraction. We studied frequency matching and overlapping behaviour during 100 naturally occurring diurnal song contests among male chickadees using an Acoustic Location System (ALS). The ALS consisted of 16 microphones that recorded countersinging interactions across multiple territories simultaneously, allowing us to triangulate the position of individuals based on delays in sound arrival at each microphone. We used the ALS to record 10 neighbourhoods of chickadees whose relative dominance status had been tabulated during the preceding winter. In 80% of contests there was at least one instance of overlapping between the contestants. In 37% of contests, the contestants were frequency matched within 50 Hz. Neither overlapping nor matching occurred at levels different from those expected by chance. However, contests that contained frequency matching had significantly more instances of overlapping than nonmatched contests. There were no rank-related differences in the proportion of opponents' songs that were frequency matched or overlapped. In using an Acoustic Location System to record entire neighbourhoods of territorial songbirds, this study is the first to quantify song matching and overlapping by free-living animals in the context of natural countersinging exchanges between familiar territorial neighbours.

AB Gaze following and the ability to understand that another individual sees something different from oneself are widely considered important components of animal social cognition. Recent studies suggest that gaze following is taxonomically widespread, yet for many species there is no evidence that gaze following is employed in a flexible manner and is more than a simple so-called 'orienting reflex'. Here, we measured the effect of social facial expressions, mimicking responses to social events, on gaze following in longtailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis, using a human demonstrator. Gaze-shifts accompanied by a socially meaningful facial expression ( the Bare Teeth display) elicited stronger gaze-following responses than neutral gaze-shifts. Subjects also 'check-looked', that is, looked back and forth between the experimenter's face and their gaze direction, which has been proposed to indicate that a subject understands that another individual is looking at a specific stimulus. Monkeys' gaze following is thus modulated by the facial emotional expressions of the demonstrator, providing evidence that their gaze following is more flexible than was previously thought. This modulation may be due to a specific arousal-or attention-based mechanism or may be based on the subject understanding that the demonstrator is attending to something the subject cannot see.

AB Nociception is the ability to perceive a noxious stimulus and react in a re flexive manner and occurs across a wide range of taxa. However, the ability to experience the associated aversive sensation and feeling, known as pain, is not widely accepted to occur in nonvertebrates. We examined the responses of a decapod crustacean, the prawn, Palaemon elegans, to different noxious stimuli applied to one antenna to assess reflex responses (nociception) and longer-term, specifically directed behavioural responses that might indicate pain. We also examined the effects of benzocaine, a local anaesthetic, on these responses. Noxious stimuli elicited an immediate reflex tail flick response, followed by two prolonged activities, grooming of the antenna and rubbing of the antenna against the side of the tank, with both activities directed specifically at the treated antenna. These responses were inhibited by benzocaine; however, benzocaine did not alter general swimming activity and thus the decline in grooming and rubbing is not due to general anaesthesia. Mechanical stimulation by pinching also resulted in prolonged rubbing, but this was not inhibited by benzocaine. These results indicate an awareness of the location of the noxious stimuli, and the prolonged complex responses indicate a central involvement in their organization. The inhibition by a local anaesthetic is similar to observations on vertebrates and is consistent with the idea that these crustaceans can experience pain.

AB In groups of animals only a small proportion of individuals may possess particular information, such as a migration route or the direction to a resource. Individuals may differ in preferred direction resulting in conflicts of interest and, therefore, consensus decisions may have to be made to prevent the group from splitting. Recent theoretical work has shown how leadership and consensus decision making can occur without active signalling or individual recognition. Here we test these predictions experimentally using humans. We found that a small informed minority could guide a group of naive individuals to a target without verbal communication or obvious signalling. Both the time to target and deviation from target were decreased by the presence of informed individuals. When conflicting directional information was given to different group members, the time taken to reach the target was not significantly increased; suggesting that consensus decision making in conflict situations is possible, and highly efficient. Where there was imbalance in the number of informed individuals with conflicting information, the majority dictated group direction. Our results also suggest that the spatial starting position of informed individuals influences group motion, which has implications in terms of crowd control and planning for evacuations.

AB Two competing hypotheses are commonly used to explain matings with multiple males in female birds. The genetic benefit model sees extrapair copulations as a means to enhance offspring viability, while the fertility-insurance hypothesis states that females copulate with multiple males to guarantee fertilization of eggs. According to the genetic benefit hypothesis, extrapair young are expected to have a genetic advantage over their maternal half-sibs raised in the same brood. A quantifiable measure for offspring quality is the immunocompetence, the ability of an individual to cope with infections. In this study, we used the phytohaemagglutinin induced skin-swelling response technique to test whether the cell-mediated immune reaction differs between extrapair and within-pair nestlings from mixed-paternity broods in the polygynous red bishop, Euplectes orix. The strength of the nestlings' immune response was positively linked to general health status and immunological condition of their genetic fathers, indicating a heritable component of nestling immunocompetence. We found that extrapair young were actually significantly less immunocompetent than within-pair young from the same nest, a result that does not lend support to the genetic benefit hypothesis. We suggest that female red bishops mated to successful high-quality males engage in extrapair copulations to insure against temporary infertility in their social mates caused by sperm depletion because of frequent copulations with their multiple female partners. This result, however, was significant only in the hotter of 2 years, indicating that environmental factors can obscure variation in nestling fitness arising from female extrapair mating behaviour.

AB Boyd & Richerson (1988 Social Learning. Psychological and Biological Perspectives, pp. 29-48) predicted from formal models of the evolution of social learning that an animal should rely more heavily on socially acquired information when seeking a nutrient that it has difficulty learning to select for itself than when seeking a nutrient it can readily identify. We compared the extent to which Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, seeking either sodium (which they can easily identify) or protein (which they cannot identify), relied on information acquired from recently fed conspecific demonstrators when selecting a food. Consistent with Boyd & Richerson's prediction, when choosing between two unfamiliar, distinctively flavoured foods rich in both protein and sodium, protein-deprived rats showed significantly greater social influence on their food choices than did sodium-deprived rats.

AB To understand the evolution and exaggeration of male traits, we need to clarify the combined and separate contributions of male competition and mate choice to male reproductive success. Here, I tested whether female skinks discriminate between males based on morphological or behavioural traits in a sequential mate choice experiment to identify whether females prefer dominant males. A total of 48 females were tested of which, 26 mated with at least one male. Some females mated multiply with the same male or with both males. Females were more likely to mate with males that courted more and did not prefer males with orange ventral colour, which is indicative of male dominance. Females may use courtship as a cue to male quality because it was positively correlated with the duration of the mating grasp, during which time the male has to carry the female, and mating grasp is also positively correlated with mating duration. Interestingly, males courted smaller females more than larger females, despite the fact that larger females are more fecund. The results of this study suggest that the two processes of sexual selection may be favouring different male traits, resulting in male competition favouring male orange colour and mate choice favouring male courtship.

AB Chemical substances produced by one species are sometimes found on the body of another species. Animals often ingest such foreign substances and sequester them into their integument, but here we report a case of direct application of heterospecific substances to the body. California ground squirrels, Spermophilus beecheyi, and rock squirrels, Spermophilus variegatus, apply scent derived from their major predator, rattlesnakes, Crotalus spp., by chewing shed rattlesnake skins and licking their fur. We found that the sequence of body areas licked during application was essentially the same for the two species. We consider three hypotheses regarding the function of this 'snake scent application' ( SSA): antipredator defence, ectoparasite defence, and conspecific deterrence. To test these hypotheses, we assessed patterns of species and sex/age class differences in application quantity and compared them with patterns reflecting differences in the importance of predation,. ea loads and conspecific aggression as sources of selection. We found no species differences in application quantity; however, juveniles and adult females of both species engaged in longer bouts of application than adult males. This pattern of sex/age class differences in SSA supports only the antipredator hypothesis because juveniles are most vulnerable to predation and adult females actively protect their young. We found no evidence to support either the ectoparasite defence or conspecific deterrence hypotheses. Thus, SSA behaviour may be a novel form of chemical defence against predation.

AB Cooperation among nonhuman animals has been the topic of much theoretical and empirical research, but few studies have examined systematically the effects of various reward payoffs on cooperative behaviour. Here, we presented heterosexual pairs of cooperatively breeding cottontop tamarins with a cooperative problem-solving task. In a series of four experiments, we examined how the tamarins' cooperative performance changed under conditions in which (1) both actors were mutually rewarded, (2) both actors were rewarded reciprocally across days, (3) both actors competed for a monopolizable reward and (4) one actor repeatedly delivered a single reward to the other actor. The tamarins showed sensitivity to the reward structure, showing the greatest percentage of trials solved and shortest latency to solve the task in the mutual reward experiment and the lowest percentage of trials solved and longest latency to solve the task in the experiment in which one actor was repeatedly rewarded. However, even in the experiment in which the fewest trials were solved, the tamarins still solved 46 +/- 12% of trials and little to no aggression was observed among partners following inequitable reward distributions. The tamarins did, however, show selfish motivation in each of the experiments. Nevertheless, in all experiments, unrewarded individuals continued to cooperate and procure rewards for their social partners. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Kleptoparasitism, the stealing of food items already procured by others, is a widespread foraging strategy in animals, yet the reasons why some taxa have evolved this strategy and others have not remain unresolved. It has been hypothesized that kleptoparasitism should be more pro. table, and hence have more often evolved, in lineages featuring certain characteristics, such as a large body mass, an enlarged brain or a dependence on vertebrate prey. Alternatively, the evolution of kleptoparasitism could have been facilitated in certain ecological contexts, such as open habitats or mixed-species foraging groups. Here, we test these hypotheses for the evolution of food stealing with a comparative analysis in birds, using information on 856 field reports of interspecific kleptoparasitism from all over the world. In multivariate analyses controlling for common ancestry, the probability that a family uses kleptoparasitism was positively associated with residual size of the brain, habitat openness and the presence of vertebrate prey in the diet, but showed no association with body size or participation in mixed-species foraging groups. The conclusion that kleptoparasitism is associated more closely with cognition than with aggression is further supported by the finding that kleptoparasites have a larger residual brain size than their respective hosts, while their body size is not significantly larger. By emphasizing the central role of cognitive abilities in avian kleptoparasitism, our results offer a novel perception of avian food stealing, which in the past was primarily seen in terms of 'brawn' rather than 'brains'.

AB Male calling or singing behaviour often plays a crucial role in competition among males and attraction of females. We studied the occurrence of male calls in a paternal nest-guarding fish, the rock-pool blenny. We found that males often produced calls when a female entered their nest burrow and during her visit inside the burrow. The dominant grunt-like part of these calls has a fundamental frequency of about 30 Hz and generally contains one to six harmonics. This harmonic component is typically preceded by a short introductory component and often followed by an even shorter terminal component, both of relatively low amplitude and irregular spectral composition. The fundamental frequency differs consistently between males and is negatively correlated with male size. Consequently, spectral features of the calls may be used in female mate choice during the female's decision to stay in a burrow and spawn. Not all males that were observed during a female visit produced calls, nor did calling males call during all female visits. The number of calls during a visit varied within and between males and ranged from 1 to 13. Calling may express some male mate preference when calls are selectively produced during visits of preferred large females. However, we did not find any evidence for differences in calling activity towards three female size classes, nor was there an effect of male size. This is one of the first reports in the literature on the use of sounds in blenny courtship behaviour and adds to a growing body of evidence revealing the communicative importance of acoustic signals in a wide variety of fish taxa.

AB In communally nesting species such as mice, nursing females may be confronted with alien and own young in mixed litters, and offspring may be fostered by either own or alien mothers. Because of the costly nature of maternal investment and offspring solicitation behaviour, maternal provisioning is expected to favour own young. While previous studies have investigated kin recognition between mother and pups with inconclusive results, it remains unexplored whether any such ability yields a fitness advantage for own pups when nursed in a mixed litter. Moreover, nursing females may have evolved strategies to effect a reduction in fitness costs associated with nursing alien pups, for example, reducing their maternal effort. In this study, we show that young mice procure an advantage by gaining relatively more weight than alien pups when nursed together in a mixed litter by their own mothers. However, we did not detect an effect of offspring or maternal genotype on this difference in weight gain. Furthermore, we show that mothers provide overall fewer resources to mixed litters than to unmixed litters and that two mouse strains differ in the magnitude of this reduction. We suggest that a combination of sibling competition and maternal strategies to reduce costs of nursing unrelated young may be the underlying causes of these findings.

AB Northeast Pacific blue whales, Balaenoptera musculus, migrate annually between productive summer feeding grounds off North America and tropical winter breeding grounds off Central America. These migratory movements have been confirmed through acoustic monitoring of the long-duration, low-frequency sounds produced by males ( type B calls). However, other calls in the species' repertoire might prove a better proxy for the migratory and foraging behaviour of the population as a whole. To explore the seasonal and daily calling behaviour of this population, we evaluated the occurrence of three blue whale call types ( song B, singular B and D) recorded between 2000 and 2004 at Cortez and Tanner Banks, a summer feeding area offshore of southern California. We recorded a significant temporal separation among the type B and D calls, both seasonally and daily, suggesting preferred use of certain call types during different behavioural states. A consistent seasonal pattern was evident, with D calling from April to November and song and singular B calling from June to January. In addition, D calls were heard primarily from dawn through to dusk, in contrast to the crepuscular pattern of song, suggesting that the production of D calls is related to feeding behaviour, which occurs primarily during the day on aggregated krill at depth. An increase in the length of the overall calling season was also observed from 2000 to 2004 and may be related to increased prey availability in the Southern California Bight relative to more southerly feeding areas.

AB The importance of stress as a factor in influencing life history strategies has received considerable attention in recent years, because it appears to have a substantial impact on an individual's behaviour and physiology. Birds respond to environmental and social stressors by the production of corticosterone, a glucocorticoid hormone released by the adrenal gland. In this experiment, we tested whether female zebra. finches preferred males selected to produce low or high peak levels of circulating plasma corticosterone. Plasma corticosterone and testosterone levels of the males were recorded, as were morphometric measurements and perch activity. Spectrophotometric measurements were also taken from several putatively sexually selected regions of the males. The females preferred the males from the low corticosterone lines to the high corticosterone males. In addition to, and consistent with this effect, females preferred males with the lowest corticosterone titres. Male activity, testosterone level, body size and mass had no effect on female preference. Leg and beak brightness were important, however, as were the brightness and chromaticity of the male cheek patch. These results are discussed in relation to contemporary hypotheses in sexual selection, particularly in the context of stress-mediated signalling.

AB Previous studies using the aphid Myzus persicae have shown that strong heritable variability in a defence behaviour, response to aphid alarm pheromone, is consistently associated with the possession of two insecticide resistance mechanisms. Insecticide-susceptible and -resistant aphids therefore provide the ideal biological material for testing the hypothesis that interactions with the third trophic level (parasitoids) can play a significant inhibitory role in the evolution of adaptive traits at the second trophic level (aphids), based on a fitness trade-off between resistance to insecticides and avoidance of parasitism through defence behaviour. Eight parthenogenetic M. persicae clones, representing different insecticide resistance genotypes, were exposed to alarm pheromone to confirm their level of response. Observations of these clones during periods of exposure to adult female parasitoids, Diaeretiella rapae, were then made in small-scale arenas in the presence and absence of measured amounts of alarm pheromone. Clones showing a consistently high alarm response (insecticide-susceptible forms) displayed a range of behaviours during and after parasitoid attack that were significantly associated with greater survival (avoidance of parasitism) compared with aphids showing a low alarm response (insecticide-resistant forms). Furthermore, this culminated in the latter suffering significantly higher levels of mummification. These data not only provide important empirical evidence that a normal (wild-type) high aphid alarm response reduces vulnerability to parasitoid attack but also represent the first example of insecticide resistance genes having negative pleiotropic effects on fitness by producing maladaptive behaviours in the context of selection imposed by a higher trophic level.

AB Parent investment theory predicts that parents should adjust their investment in offspring defence according to offspring value. For instance, parents should protect older, more valuable, offspring more intensively than younger offspring against a given risk of mortality. The benefits of protection may, however, vary with offspring age and parents should thus behave according to the harm that offspring would suffer in the absence of parental defence. Prior studies on this topic have focused mainly on birds and mammals with data on other taxa largely lacking. We used the parasitoid wasp Goniozus nephantidis to investigate the effect of offspring developmental stage on maternal defence against infanticidal conspecific females. On finding a host caterpillar, a G. nephantidis female paralyses it and lays eggs onto it approximately 1 day later, then remains with the offspring during development until the offspring pupate. If the host is encountered by a second female, classic owner-intruder contests ensue, with the loser being aggressively excluded from the vicinity of the host. We tested the effect of brood developmental stage on contest outcomes and also assessed the consequences of offspring age for their survival in the event that an intruder female wins the contest. We found that females defend younger offspring more than older offspring. Explanations for this behaviour are discussed in terms of owner-intruder asymmetries in resource value and the `harm to offspring hypothesis'.

AB The presence of young infants influences female primate social behaviour, in particular social grooming, which may be exchanged for infant access within a biological market place ( Henzi & Barrett, 2002, Animal Behaviour, 63, 915e921). Although social grooming is common among Old World primate species, it is rarely observed in a number of NewWorld primate species, including spider monkeys. We investigated whether affiliative behaviour is exchanged for infant handling among wild female spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi yucatanesis. Occurrences of approaches, grooming and embraces received by 15 adult females were compared when they had infants less than 6 months old (` mothers') and at all other times. The occurrence of grooming was not influenced by the presence of infants. However, females received significantly more approaches and embraces when they were mothers compared to all other times. As mothers, they received significantly more embraces than they gave indicating that the increase in friendly behaviour received was due to increased interest from other females and not simply a general increase in sociality. The exchange of embraces for infant handling was subject to a market effect as the proportion of embraces given to mothers followed by infant handling decreased when fewer infants were present in the group. Although spider monkeys use embraces as the primary means of gaining access to infants, whether embraces provide long- term benefits to the recipient, remains to be determined. Thus, embraces may only serve to signal benign intent and reassure mothers during tense interactions such as infant handling.

AB Refractory periods at the onset of dispersal occur when individuals initially do not settle in response to cues from naturally occurring habitats. The current paper focuses on relationships between refractory periods and habitat selection behaviour when natal dispersers use sequential search tactics. We first show how individual differences in acceptance thresholds can produce predictable relationships across individuals between the duration of their refractory periods and the time when they become responsive to cues from less preferred habitats. We then test these predictions using recurrent F1 crosses ( genotypes) of Drosophila melanogaster. We found consistent differences between genotypes with respect to the duration of their refractory periods, and strong correlations across the genotypes between the duration of refractory periods and the time when individuals accepted cues from less preferred habitats, the time when they accepted habitats with supernormal cues, and an estimate of the total time available for search. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that individual differences in acceptance thresholds can lead to correlations across individuals between the duration of the refractory period and the time during search when they accept less preferred habitats. We discuss the implications of these results for studies of habitat selection by natal dispersers, and for studies of individual differences in other behavioural contexts (i.e. mate choice) in which animals search for a single item with a large impact on fitness.

AB Both white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, and mule deer, O. hemionus, females defend fawns against coyotes, Canis latrans, but only mule deer defend nonoffspring conspecific and heterospecific fawns. During a predator attack, females may have to decide whether to defend a fawn while having imperfect information on its identity obtained from hearing a few distress calls. Although imperfect recognition can influence altruistic behaviour, few empirical studies have considered this point when testing functional explanations for altruism. We designed a series of playback experiments with fawn distress calls to test alternative hypotheses (by-product of parental care, kin selection, reciprocal altruism) for the mule deer's defence of nonoffspring, specifically allowing for the possibility that females mistake these fawns for their own. White-tailed deer females approached the speaker only when distress calls of white-tailed deer fawns were played and when their own fawn was hidden, suggesting that fawn defence was strictly a matter of parental care in this species. In contrast, mule deer females responded similarly and strongly, regardless of the caller's identity, the female's reproductive state (mother or nonmother) or the presence of their own offspring. The failure of mule deer females to adjust their responses to these conditions suggests that the), do not defend nonoffspring because they mistake them for their own fawns. The lack of behavioural discrimination also suggests that kin selection, reciprocal altruism and defence of the offspring's area are unlikely to explain the mule deer's defence of nonoffspring. We identify causal and functional questions that still need to be addressed to understand why mule deer defend fawns so indiscriminately. (C) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Factors underlying the evolution of female-biased sexual size dimorphism in mammals are poorly understood. In an effort to better understand these factors we tested whether larger female southern flying squirrels, Glaucomys volans, gained reproductive advantages (larger litters or more male mates) and direct resource benefits, such as larger home ranges or access to more food (i.e. mast-producing trees). As dimorphism can vary with age in precocial breeding species, we compared females during their first reproduction and during a subsequent breeding attempt. Females were not significantly larger or heavier than males at first reproduction, but became about 7% heavier and 22% larger than males at subsequent breeding. Larger females produced larger litters and had home ranges containing a greater proportion of upland hardwood trees. Female body size was not associated with either multiple male mating or home range size, but females with larger home ranges had higher indexes of body condition. Females in precocial breeding flying squirrels initiate reproduction before sexual size dimorphism is evident, and thus, may be allocating resources to both reproduction and growth simultaneously, or delaying growth entirely. Larger females produce more pups and have access to more food resources. Thus, selection for increased female size may partly explain how female-biased sexual size dimorphism is maintained in this species. (c) 2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Previous studies have reported that pair duration is positively related to breeding performance and negatively related to divorce probability. According to the concept of 'mate familiarity', a long-term improvement in pair coordination with pair duration results in increased breeding performance. We assessed whether breeding experience, costs of mate change, individual quality and prior residence explained relationships involving pair duration in the kittiwake, Rissa tridactyla. We used specific samples (groups of individuals) where confounding factors were not relevant. In the complete data set (a heterogeneous group of individuals), breeding success probability increased with pair duration. Such variation in fitness may reflect changes at the individual level, or in the proportion of individuals of different quality. Breeding experience accounted for a sharp increase in success probability between the first and second years of pair duration. This trend was not observed in new pairs composed of only experienced breeders. Success probability did not increase with pair duration within groups of pairs with the same total duration, or in high-quality birds (using longevity as an index of quality). Finally, mate fidelity and site fidelity may be confounding factors. Prior residence (length of residence at the nest site) better explained variation in success and divorce probabilities than did pair duration. Overall, we found no evidence of a continuous increase in success probability with pair history that could be attributed to mate familiarity. This study highlights the need to consider within-population heterogeneity when assessing the evolution of life history traits. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The causes and consequences of territory size have attracted considerable attention, but there has been relatively little research on optimal territory shape. We manipulated the shape of food patches, independent of patch area (square, 13.6 x 13.6 cm; rectangular, 46.5 x 4.0 cm; elongated, 93.0 x 2.0 cm), presented to small, medium and large convict cichlids, Archocentrus trigrorasciatus, in groups of varying size (three, six, 12 fish). We used a 3 x 3 factorial design to test the predictions that the defence and monopolization of a food patch would decrease as both patch perimeter and group size increased. As predicted, with increasing patch perimeter, the ability of the large (dominant) fish to defend the patch decreased, as reflected by a decrease in the frequency of aggression and the proportion of the aggression by the dominant. Similarly, intruder success typically increased with increasing patch perimeter, as reflected by an increase in the proportion of intruders in the patch and the duration that an intruder remained in the patch. Group size also had the predicted effect on most response variables; in general, defender success decreased and intruder success increased as group size increased. Furthermore, the effects of increasing the patch perimeter and group size on measures of defensibility were largely additive. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The ability of animals to plan their foraging journeys and to approach resources in a goal-directed way may play a key role in cognitive evolution. Furthermore, optimal foraging theory assumes that animals are adapted to take least-effort routes between resources. Empirical evidence for these beliefs is largely lacking, however. We followed a group of chacma baboons over full days during a 16-month field study. We used GPS to investigate route linearity, travel speed and inter-resource distances, and the degree to which movement was guided by direct visual stimuli from the resources. During the dry season the study group travelled rapidly to sparse fruit sources and waterholes along linear paths over large distances. Inter-resource distances were larger than distances from which the resources could be seen. Seed resources, although situated closer to the sleeping site than fruit sources, were bypassed in the mornings and consumed predominantly in the afternoons, when movements were less linear, slower and shorter. During the rainy season, the animals left their sleeping sites earlier when visiting restricted and patchily distributed fig trees than when visiting abundant and evenly distributed fruit resources. However, travel speed and route linearity were not always associated with goal directedness, because the baboons approached the single sleeping site, presumably a vital resource, slowly and indirectly. Our results suggest that baboons plan their journeys, actively choosing between several out-of-sight resources and approaching them in an efficient, goal-directed way, characteristics commonly used as diagnostic for the presence of a cognitive map and episodic memory.

AB We studied individual and herd level behavioural responses of elk to spatial and temporal variation in the risk of predation by wolves over three winters in the Upper Gallatin drainage, Montana, U.S.A. Within a given drainage, elk of both sexes moved into or closer to protective cover (timber) in response to wolf presence. Cow elk responded to elevated risk by increasing vigilance in exchange for foraging, and large mixed (cow, calf, spike) herds substantially decreased in size. In contrast, when wolves were present, bulls did not increase vigilance levels, or decrease feeding, and small bull-only groups slightly increased in size. As a consequence, small bull-only herds and large mixed-sex herds converged on a similar size when wolves were present. We think this response is a balancing of the benefits of risk dilution with increased detectability or attractiveness of larger herds to wolves. Based on proportions in the population, wolves overselected bulls and underselected cows as prey. Thus, bulls showed weaker antipredator responses than cows, despite facing a greater risk of predation. Using marrow fat content from elk killed by wolves as an indicator of body condition, bulls were in significantly worse body condition than cows throughout the winter, and condition deteriorated for both sexes as winter progressed. Overall, we conclude that antipredator behaviours carry substantial foraging costs, that bulls, because of their poorer body condition, are less able to pay these costs than cows, and that differences in ability to pay foraging costs probably explain sex-specific differences in antipredator behaviours.

ID SPACING BEHAVIOR; WELFARE; PREFERENCES; SIZE
AB We investigated the response of commercially farmed broiler (meat) chickens to their social environment at five stocking densities, using spatial distribution and behaviour. We used a computer model in which a 'social aversion/attraction' parameter was set at different values to give simulations in which the chickens were averse, indifferent or positively attracted to each other. We examined the spatial distribution of real chickens that were neither feeding nor drinking, using video records taken within commercial houses, to see which setting of the model best fitted the observed data. At all stocking densities, chickens were more clustered than indifferent (randomly distributed) chickens, and their distribution best fitted a social attraction model in which simulated birds rejected a potential position if their distance from other birds was too great. The parameter setting that best fitted the observed data was a model in which simulated chickens had a high probability of rejecting a position if the nearest chicken was more than an estimated 75 cm away: they were socially attracted rather than socially averse. This result suggests that, even at high commercial stocking densities, real broiler chickens may find the close proximity of other birds more attractive than aversive. Except for jostling and number of strides per walking bout, behaviour did not change across the stocking densities studied, nor, except for gait, did the most obvious measures of bird health (mortality, culls, leg health).

ID BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES
AB Recent attention has been drawn to the existence of individual differences in correlated behaviour across contexts, animal 'personality' (Gosling 2001, Psychological Bulletin, 127, 45-86) and behavioural syndromes (Sih et al. 2004b, Quarterly Review of Biology, 79, 241-277). The causes of these patterns of behaviour are subjects of debate. Here, we present a very simple model of how adaptively managing noisy information, combined with differences in individual state, can lead to evolutionarily stable differences in how individuals respond to environmental cues. When information is very noisy, behavioural syndromes are most likely, but as long as there is some error, some types of individuals display the same behaviour in all contexts. In extreme cases, very few individuals display flexible behaviour, and different stable behavioural types dominate the population. (c) 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Foraging decisions in nonhuman animals often require choosing between small, immediate food rewards and larger, more delayed rewards. Faced with such choices, animals typically discount or devalue the future quite strongly. Although discounting studies often focus on delays to reward access, other temporal intervals contribute to foraging rate, and thus may potentially influence discounting levels. Here, we examine the effect of handling time, the time required to process and consume food, on discounting in cottontop tamarins, Saguinus oedipus, and common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, two species that differ in levels of temporal discounting. We presented subjects with a discounting task under two conditions. In the first condition, we made the entire reward available after the delay expired. In the second condition, we experimentally increased the minimum length of time required to consume the reward to simulate a longer handling time. We found that tamarins and marmosets showed sensitivity to increases in the time necessary to process food rewards. Both species adjusted their preferences to account for different handling times at long delays to accessing food. Consequently, models of discounting behaviour that include handling times may better describe animal choices than models that focus exclusively on delays prior to access.

AB In some nonpollinating fig wasps, male competition for mates often results in serious injury or death. We studied the factors associated with fighting behaviour in an undescribed Philotrypesis fig wasp species. We quantified morphological traits in 440 males and revealed the presence of two discrete, but cryptic, male morphs, termed 'aggressive' (A) and 'passive' (P). For a given head size, morph A had larger mandibles. However, the body size distributions of the two morphs overlapped considerably, such that morph designation required calculation of the ratio of mandible (weapon) size to head size. Importantly, this means that standard analyses for dimorphism do not identify the two morphs correctly. We also sampled 62 pairs of males engaged in escalated fights and compared their size matching with that of randomly chosen pairs of males from the same patch. There was a significantly greater discrepancy in mandible size in fighting pairs than in randomly chosen pairs of males. Furthermore, our cryptic morph designation revealed the process underlying this pattern, as follows. Although only 22% of males were morph A, 45% of these males were involved in fights. In contrast, 78% of males were morph P, but only 16% of them were involved in fights. The different population frequencies and fighting tendencies of the two morphs combine to ensure that most fights occur between 'heteromorphic' pairs and this, in turn, generates the significant jaw size discrepancy recorded between fighting males.

AB With continually changing arable farming practices, knowledge of the invertebrates in the chick diet of many farmland bird species is important, as it can help in their habitat management and conservation. Although studies have found which groups are represented in the diet, this does not necessarily mean these items are preferred. To gain some understanding of the basic principles underlying a chick's choice of food, we fed grey partridge chicks different insect taxa and coloured food pellets to determine whether preference was related to size, colour or movement of the food items. Trials were conducted against white, brown and green backgrounds. There were significant differences in the overall selection of insect taxa, with wide differences in the probability of selection between items. With no movement, choice was primarily influenced by size and colour. Colour influenced selection for similarly sized items, with a preference for green/yellow over brown/black, but size also affected choice within the most preferred colours. Red was least selected. With live insects, colour and size again had the greatest effect on choice, but movement also affected the selection of smaller items. Selection of uniformly sized coloured food pellets gave a similar colour selection choice to that obtained with insects. However, in natural habitats the preferred larger items, generally green/yellow, could be more difficult to see if immobile and cryptically coloured. They might also be located on vegetation and physically unavailable, restricting choice to the smaller, often active, but less preferred items.

AB The operational sex ratio (OSR) is believed to play a major role in determining the opportunity for sexual selection. Most studies that investigate the effects of OSR on the opportunity for sexual selection, however, ignore the important effects that OSR has on sexual coercion. Sexually coercive behaviour by males, including forceful or subversive mating tactics and sexual harassment, may cause females to mate suboptimally and thus have important consequences for the opportunity for sexual selection. We investigated how variation in OSR affects sexual coercion in guppies, Poecilia reticulata, and examined the costs of this coercion to females. Males did not change mating tactics nor did individuals perform more coercive acts in the male-biased treatment, but the net rate of coercive intersexual interactions was higher simply because there were more males present. Increased sexual coercion did not affect direct fitness components (including number, weight and survival of offspring) or the proportion of courtship displays to which females responded positively.

AB Secondary sexual characters are often positively allometric, such that larger individuals of a species have proportionally larger traits. The sexually selected weapons found on many insect species, however, show declining allometric slopes with body size. Previous work on these curved allometric relations has focused on the role of competition for limited resources between growing body parts within pupae, but there is an alternative explanation that has received little attention: changes in the allometric slope may reflect changes in the fitness benefits associated with increases in horn size and body size change as an animal gets larger. The allometric curve of the horn of the male dung beetle Euoniticellus intermedius shows one of the largest declines in slope known and by setting up contests between males of similar, or different, sizes over access to females we were able to investigate the importance of horn and body size for males of different sizes and horn lengths. Both body size and horn size were important in determining contest outcome in small males, but horn size became more important as body size increased, so that in contests between large males it was by far the most important predictor of victory. These findings are consistent with theoretical predictions of how fitness functions can affect allometry and offer an alternative to some of the previous verbal arguments made to explain positive allometry.

AB Cleaning is a classic example of mutualism and determining the factors that maintain the balance between the costs and benefits for mutualist partners can assist our understanding of how cleaning relationships are maintained. Optimal foraging theory suggests two factors that might help to maintain the relationship between cleaners and their clients: client ectoparasite load and cleaner hunger levels. The ecological relevance and importance of foraging by cleaner fish in marine systems has been demonstrated repeatedly, yet there is little information available on this behaviour in cleaner shrimp. To determine whether cleaner shrimp base their choice of client fish on food patch quality (i.e. client fish ectoparasite load) we offered the yellow-beaked cleaner shrimp Urocaridella sp. c a choice of parasitized and unparasitized rock cods, Cephalopholis cyanostigma. To determine whether cleaner shrimp hunger levels influence cleaning time, we manipulated hunger levels in Urocaridella sp. c and examined their behaviour towards parasitized client fish. Cleaner shrimp preferred parasitized to unparasitized client fish and food-deprived cleaner shrimp cleaned parasitized rock cods more frequently than satiated cleaner shrimp did. Therefore, variations in client fish ectoparasite load and cleaner shrimp hunger level are two factors that affect the balance in this mutualism. Finally, our results meet some of the assumptions of biological market theory, a framework used to understand cooperative interactions, and thus this framework is suggested for future studies on this cleaning system.

AB The male courtship display of the fiddler crab Uca perplexa is a conspicuous claw waving that is directed at females to attract them to their burrows for mating. Like most other fiddler crabs, this species has an approximately biweekly reproductive cycle with mating spread over about 10 days. However, most mating takes place in the 3 days immediately preceding new and full moons. We examined the relation between the time males spend waving to females and the time they subsequently spend underground in their burrow, guarding their mates until they ovulate and then fertilizing their eggs. Early in the mating period, males courted females for about 3-5 s before the female entered their burrows, and males guarded these females for 3-5 days. During the 3 days of peak mating activity, courting time decreased significantly to about 2 s and guarding time decreased to about 1 day. This pattern cannot be explained by females preferring extended waving periods, decreased female choosiness towards the end of the mating period or variation in male waving over the mating period. We conclude that males of this species modulate their investment in courtship according to changing levels of female responsiveness to courtship.

AB Jumping spiders have long been known to have large principal eyes with ultraviolet (UV) receptors, and many species of their arthropod prey have body parts that reflect strongly in the UV waveband. However, no attempt has been made to investigate the effects of UV cues from prey on the foraging behaviour of jumping spiders. We performed laboratory experiments to test the hypothesis that jumping spiders use UV cues for locating and discriminating prey. We used Portia labiata, a web-invading, spider-eating jumping spider, as the predator and Argiope versicolor, an orb-web-building spider that decorates its web with UV-reflecting silk stabilimenta, as prey. Portia labiata could detect the difference between UV-reflecting and non-UV-reflecting stabilimentum-decorated webs and they preferentially approached the UV-reflecting ones. These findings may have wide implications for studies of animal foraging, and support one hypothesized function of salticid UV vision, the role of which is largely unknown.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

DT Article
ID WARNING COLORATION; GREGARIOUSNESS; BUTTERFLIES; BENEFITS; SIGNALS;
   COSTS; SIZE
AB The relationship between gregariousness and warning signals in defended species has been the subject of much debate. While previous researchers have found that predators learn to avoid conspicuous unpalatable prey faster when they are in aggregations, they have not presented solitary and aggregated unprofitable prey to predators simultaneously to directly compare their survivorship. Furthermore, no experiment has investigated the influence of profitable prey configuration on predator response to aggregation in unprofitable prey. Here we investigated the response of human, Homo sapiens, predators to profitable and unprofitable prey in a computer version of the 'novel world' experiments that addressed these issues. When all prey types were cryptic and all profitable prey were solitary, then aggregated unprofitable prey had higher per capita survivorship than solitary unprofitable prey. In this case, aggregation was the sole reliable distinguishing characteristic of unprofitability. By contrast, when profitable and unprofitable prey could be distinguished in terms of their conspicuousness, then aggregation did not confer a benefit to unprofitable prey. When profitable prey were simultaneously presented in solitary and aggregated configurations, aggregated profitable prey consistently had a lower per capita survivorship than solitary profitable prey, regardless of the configuration of unprofitable prey. We conclude that while aggregation can serve as a signal of unprofitability, it may not be required for the evolution of warning signals. Instead, we suggest that the common association between aggregation and distastefulness may primarily arise for a 'negative' reason: the vulnerability of aggregated palatable prey.

   VERSICOLOR; EVOLUTIONARY
AB Females are expected to use spectral properties of acoustic signals for mate choice because dominant frequency often provides reliable information about mate size. The advertisement calls of grey treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis and H. versicolor) have two main frequency bands: the amplitude of the dominant, high-frequency band averages 7-10 dB greater than that of the low-frequency band. The frequencies of these peaks were negatively correlated with male body size in both species. I used two-speaker playbacks of synthetic calls to generate preference functions for both species based on simultaneous variation in the frequencies of the two bands and, for H. versicolor, on variation in single-component calls; frequencies of most of these stimuli fell within the range of the dominant, high-frequency band. When two-component sounds were used, preference functions were bimodal and broad, with peaks close to (H. versicolor) or slightly higher than (H. chrysoscelis) mean frequencies in conspecific calls. Because preferences were not strong, I predict that females exert only weak stabilizing or directional selection on male call frequencies. When single-component calls were used in tests of H. versicolor, the preference-function peak was shifted to a lower-than-average frequency within the high-frequency range. I hypothesize that such a frequency may better stimulate both of the inner ear organs, whose tuning roughly matches frequencies in the two bands in conspecific calls, than a single component of average or much lower-than-average frequency. Females of both species preferred calls with both spectral peaks to calls with a single, high-frequency peak, even when the low-frequency peak was attenuated by 24-30 dB. This result serves to emphasize that typically subdominant frequency components can have seemingly disproportionate effects on signal attractiveness.

AB Recent evidence suggests that female ornaments in birds not only are genetic correlates of selection on males but may also have evolved by selection acting directly on females. However, most evidence comes from studies in captivity and it is therefore still debated whether male choice is important under natural conditions. The rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, is a monomorphic passerine in which both sexes show a yellow breast patch, although females have a smaller patch than males. Breast patch in females is positively correlated with body mass and fecundity (number of broods per year). We tested whether males preferentially mate with more ornamented females in this species. We examined male mate choice by reducing the size of the yellow breast patch of free-ranging females during the pair formation period in a colony in southeast Spain. We found that females with an experimentally reduced breast patch were courted less intensely and chased less frequently, than control females were. Furthermore, females with an experimentally reduced ornament were less likely to mate and, when mated, did so at a significantly later date than controls. These results are supported by correlational observations from another rock sparrow population, for which a larger data set was available, showing that pairs mated assortatively with respect to breast patch size. Altogether; these results therefore suggest that female ornamentation may be sexually selected in this species. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many carnivorous arthropods can use chemical information from plants to locate their herbivorous prey. The composition of blends of herbivore-induced plant volatiles can vary with plant and herbivore species and thus carnivores are confronted with variable information about the presence of their prey. Such environmental variation is expected to favour learning. We investigated the learning ability of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, a specialized natural enemy of polyphagous spider mites. We reared mites on different plant species, and subsequently tested their preference for volatiles from lima bean plants infested with either the prey herbivore Tetranychus urticae or the nonprey caterpillar Spodoptera exigua in a Y-tube olfactometer. Predators reared on lima bean preferred the volatiles induced by T urticae, whereas predators reared on cucumber did not. We also investigated the foraging behaviour of mites after a nonrewarding experience during the adult phase (i.e. food deprivation in the presence of S. exigua-induced volatiles from lima bean) or after a rewarding experience (i.e. feeding in the presence of T urticae-induced volatiles). The rewarding experience had a much larger impact on the foraging responses. Predatory mites with multiple experiences (i.e. a nonrewarding experience followed by a rewarding experience) had the strongest preference for T. urticae-induced versus S. exigua-induced volatiles. We conclude that these learning abilities enable the predatory mites to forage in an environment where their prey can feed on a different plant species than the one on which the predator developed, and where nonprey caterpillars are also present.

ID LOCUST PHASE POLYMORPHISM; SELF-ORGANIZATION; BEHAVIOR
AB The Mormon cricket, Anabrus simplex (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae), is a flightless katydid that undergoes major outbreaks in western North America. Under outbreak conditions, Mormon crickets often form large cohesive migratory bands that can contain millions of individuals moving in unison across the landscape. phenism has been hypothesized as a behavioural mechanism underlying Density-dependent phase poly Mormon cricket band formation and movement based largely on the similarity between bands of Mormon crickets and those of migratory locusts. I tested this hypothesis by quantifying the effects of long-term differences in rearing density versus the short-term presence or absence of conspecifics, on Mormon cricket movement behaviour across three different developmental stages. Rearing density and the presence of conspecifics both influenced Mormon cricket movement, but in distinctly different ways. Increases in the expression of walking-related behaviours were mainly induced by the short-term presence of conspecifics. The longer-term effects of high rearing density primarily influenced only, turning-related behaviours. Developmental variation in activity levels was observed and indicates that developmental stage should be an important consideration in future analyses of Mormon cricket movement. Overall, these results suggest that interindividual interactions play a greater role in inducing the movement of migratory band-forming Mormon crickets than do endogenous behavioural-phase changes mediated by high local rearing density.

AB One hypothesis for the function of vocal repertoires in songbirds is that singing multiple song types facilitates song matching, a behaviour in which one male replies to a rival's song with a song of the same type. In eastern populations of song sparrows, low levels of whole song sharing restrict opportunities for matching of entire song types. A male in this population might still match a neighbour by replying with a partially shared song (i.e. a song that contains one or more phrases in common with the neighbour's song). We tested for partial matching in a Pennsylvania population using playback of three categories of song: self song (allowing a full match), stranger song (a control allowing no match) and hybrid self/stranger song (allowing a partial match). We also tested the hypothesis that matching is a directed signal of aggressive intentions by comparing subjects' approach distances between trials in which they did and did not match. Males in our study matched in response to both self song (21 of 39 trials) and hybrid song (23 of 40 trials) at levels significantly greater than expected based on control trials (5 of 40 triads). Males that performed a partial match to a hybrid song approached the speaker more closely than males that did not match, consistent with the hypothesis that partial matching is a directed signal of aggression. Self song matching did not predict approach as successfully. C 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Migratory birds stay in a particular area for only short periods and must rapidly acquire appropriate information about stopover sites. In contrast, resident birds can update their knowledge whenever necessary. In a novel environment migrants are thus predicted to assess relevant information faster than nonmigrants. We tested this prediction with two closely related species, the migratory garden warbler, Sylvia borin, and the resident Sardinian warbler, S. melanocephala momus. Each bird was allowed to explore two unfamiliar boxes, one of which contained food. Garden warblers found food significantly faster than Sardinian warblers. Garden warblers may have a wide-area exploration strategy to assess a novel room and Sardinian warblers may have a local-area exploration strategy. We conclude that a wide-area exploration strategy might be required for migrants to assess environmental information as rapidly as possible.

AB The mate choices of sexually experienced, female Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, are influenced by information acquired by observation of potential partners engaging in social interactions. Female quail show an increased preference both for males that they have seen mate with another female and for the less aggressive of a pair of males that they have watched interact aggressively. We examined effects of females' prior sexual experience on their use of such public information when choosing a partner. We found that virgin female quail, like female quail with sexual experience, increased their preference for a male after seeing him mate with another female. Whereas sexually experienced females preferred the less aggressive member of a pair of males that they had seen engage in an agonistic encounter, virgin female quail preferred the more aggressive member of such a pair. We interpret the results as indicating that sexual experience plays little role in the development of mate-choice copying by female quail, whereas experience of punishing aspects of interactions with conspecific males reverses naive female quails' positive response to relatively aggressive members of the opposite sex.

AB Recent work has shown that elaborate secondary sexual traits and the corresponding preferences for them may be transmitted culturally rather than by genetic inheritance. Evidence for such cultural transmission commonly invokes spatial patterns of local similarity, with neighbouring individuals or populations appearing similar to each other. Alternative explanations for local similarity include ecological similarity of neighbouring environments and confounding genetic effects caused by aggregations of kin. We found that bowers built by male spotted bowerbirds, Chlamydera maculata, within a single population showed fine-scale similarities between neighbours in the decorations displayed on them. Such similarities did not covary with local decoration availability, local display environment or kinship and could not be explained by stealing behaviour by neighbours. Instead, we suggest that these similarities are products of local tradition, either culturally transmitted by neighbouring males who regularly inspect neighbours' bowers, or as localized responses to variable individual female preferences.

AB Male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, cooperate to defend a community range within which resident females range in smaller core areas. There has been debate over exactly what males are defending, whether mates, territory or both. One hypothesis holds that mates are defending mates, and that an increase in community range size will lead directly to the acquisition of more females. However, males frequently attack females as well as males at the edge of the community range. We examined 18 years of observational data on the Gombe chimpanzees to determine the behaviour of males during extragroup encounters, and the consequences of changes in community range size on the number of adult females and indirect measures of food availability. Males were always aggressive to males from other communities, and often attacked adult females, especially those that were not sexually receptive, were older, and/or had more than one offspring. The number of females did not increase with range size, but several measures suggested an increase in food availability with range size. These measures include more time spent in large foraging parties, higher encounter rates with resident females, more encounters with sexually receptive females and higher female reproductive rates. These findings suggest that males defend a feeding territory for their resident females and protect them from sexual harassment. Although a large range may eventually attract more females, this is not an immediate consequence of range expansion. Male number was not correlated with community range size.

ID BROOD DESERTION; MATE DESERTION; OFFSPRING DESERTION; KENTISH PLOVERS;
   MANIPULATION; SUCCESS; MALES
AB Parental care is a cooperative venture between a male and a female in many socially monogamous birds. Care is costly, and thus, sexual conflict arises between the parents about how much effort they should invest into rearing their young. The sexual conflict over care is most apparent when one parent abandons the brood before the offspring are independent. The deserted parent has three options: (1) desert the brood because a single parent is unable to raise the young on its own; (2) continue care provision at the same level as during biparental care, and thus do not compensate for the absence of mate; or (3) increase care and compensate partially or totally. We investigated these options in the magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens, a species in which the male deserts his mate and brood before the chick is independent. During biparental care, females fed the chick more often than the males. After their mate deserted, the females nearly doubled their feeding rate and thus, fully compensated for the lost care. Consistent with these observations, growth rates of chicks provided with biparental and female-only care did not differ. These results support recent theoretical models of parental care, and suggest that females may withhold care during biparental care to manoeuvre their mates into prolonged care provision. A female only provides at her full capacity once her mate has deserted. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To examine the role of individual variation in the dynamics of group information, I conducted a mark-recapture study and a series of laboratory and field experiments with Holocnemus pluchei spiders (Araneae: Pholcidae). These spiders can either share webs or live alone, and individuals shift frequently between these strategies. Spiders' decisions were influenced by size and recent feeding success. In the laboratory, small hungry spiders introduced into a web that held a larger conspecific resident were more likely than small well-fed spiders to abandon the web and build their own web. This behaviour pattern gradually reversed as spiders grew: large hungry spiders were more likely than large well-fed spiders to stay in the shared web. When I introduced spiders into empty webs,they were more likely to stay compared with spiders tested with conspecifics. However, hunger level also influenced behaviour even when conspecifics were not present. Food-deprived spiders were more likely to abandon webs and build their own, consistent with the idea that spiders were following a win-stay lose-shift strategy. In the field, spiders were more likely to stay in webs overnight when they were given supplemental food. In another experiment, spiders that we re found building webs in cleared areas were smaller and thinner than average. Finally, I tested whether the size of the intruder or the resident affected whether spiders joined webs. Large intruders were more successful if remaining,in webs than smaller intruders, although spiders of all sizes had some success in joining groups. Additional synthetic theoretical work is needed to integrate the complex processes underlying the formation and persistence of groups. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   behaviours by male chipping sparrows

ID SONG; WARBLER
AB Bird song may play an important role for communication among territorial neighbours, but the effect of neighbours on song use is still not well known. My previous field observations suggested that male chipping sparrows, Spizella passerina, use the dawn chorus for interactions among neighbouring males, and use day song for female attraction. To determine how these social factors may influence dawn and daytime singing behaviour, I conducted a series of experiments in which I removed the male neighbours or the female mate of territorial males during 1998-2000. Following removal of all neighbouring males, the solitary male either stopped or reduced his dawn chorus (N = 9), but did not change his daytime singing behaviour. After one of the neighbouring males was returned to his territory the focal male resumed and increased his dawn bout, accompanied with close-range countersinging. Following the removal of a territorial male's mate, the widowed male did not change the dawn chorus, but significantly increased his day song. This study thus revealed that, in chipping sparrows, the presence or absence of neighbouring males has a significant effect on the dawn chorus singing behaviour of territorial males. The presence or absence of a male's mate, in contrast, has a strong influence on a male's daytime singing behaviour. This study also supports the hypothesis that the dawn chorus And daytime song have different functions. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In small bird species, energy-demanding life cycle stages such. as moult and migration are generally separated in timed The extent of separation can vary considerably within and between species, but the causes of this variation are largely unknown. We studied the phase relation between postjuvenile moult and autumn migration by experimentally manipulating the timing of these events in the blackcap. In a. split-brood experiment, we hand-reared 30 blackcaps and kept them under either natural daylengths or a time shifted photoperiod. that altered the timing and intensity of moult. We determined the onset and termination of-moult and the onset of nocturnal migratory restlessness. In both groups, onset of migratory activity was correlated with termination of moult. The extent of moult-migration overlap was unaffected by. the photoperiod manipulation; suggesting resilience of this correlation against environmental perturbation. Strong family effects explained a large proportion of phenotypic variation. The correlation between the timing of postjuvenile moult and migration is, therefore, likely to result from genetic covariation. We predict that selection for delayed termination of moult will result in more overlap between moult and migration. Because of this correlated selection response, adaptive changes in the timing of migration could be retarded, and independent adaptive evolution of moult and migration schedules could be constrained.

AB This is the first of two papers examining male dispersal patterns in white-faced capuchins. Our study was based on behavioural and demographic data collected on multiple groups of white-faced capuchins in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica since 1985. Here we examine the patterns and proximate causation of male natal dispersal. Natal dispersal in white-faced capuchins occurred at a median age of 4.5 years, with no males remaining in the natal group past 8 years. Initial departure from the natal group appeared to be in response to an attraction to extragroup males and dispersing groupmates. Rates of parallel dispersal (dispersal with co-resident males and/or into groups containing familiar males) were very high for natal males (71-82%), and this pattern of dispersal may have evolved to increase inclusive fitness benefits in male-dispersed species. Additionally, this pattern of dispersal probably increases survivorship among dispersing males who are not yet physically mature, as is common in white-faced capuchins.

AB Classical models of grooming predict that subordinate primates will direct grooming towards dominants to receive coalitionary support from them. In contrast, recent reviews suggest that grooming asymmetries can change with social system and ecological conditions and should reflect asymmetries in services provided by different members of the dyad. We studied grooming patterns between females in six wild groups of common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, to investigate the relation between social structure and grooming between females in a cooperatively breeding species. We observed grooming frequently and consistently in all study groups. Breeding females groomed nonbreeding females more than vice versa, and grooming between breeding and nonbreeding females was not related to agonistic behaviour. Our results provide some support to the hypothesis that grooming asymmetries are related to differences in services provided by different group members. We suggest that, in cooperatively breeding systems, breeding females may use grooming as an incentive for helper females to stay in the group.

For this reason, most studies of food-associated calls focus on the benefits to a signaller of attracting a particular audience to a food source. Although call recipients respond as if they have been informed about the location of a food source, it is not necessarily the case that the primary function of food-associated calls is to inform others. I combined naturalistic observations and food placement experiments to investigate the environmental and social influences on call production in white-faced capuchin monkeys to assess other possible functions of food-associated calls. Individuals did not call under the circumstances predicted by an information-sharing hypothesis. The quantity of food and the age-sex composition of the audience did not influence call production, but food type did. Individuals produced more food-associated calls when they discovered fruit compared with insects or eggs. Results of observations of social interactions after food discovery indicated another possible function of food-associated calls. Individuals who called when they discovered food were less likely to be approached by others who were in visual contact than individuals who remained silent. Individuals who did not call when they discovered food were more likely to call subsequently if a higher-ranking, as opposed to a lower-ranking, animal approached them. Furthermore, individuals who called when approached by higher-ranking animals were less likely to receive aggression than individuals who did not call. Therefore, food-associated calls may function to announce food ownership, thereby decreasing aggression from other individuals. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI FAD: Fish Aggregating Device or Fish Attracting Device? A new analysis
   of yellowfin tuna movements around floating objects
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID THUNNUS-ALBACARES; HORIZONTAL MOVEMENTS; BEHAVIOR; ISLANDS
AB Tropical tuna are known to associate with floating objects. Because fish are easier to detect and to catch when around these objects, fishermen have extensively deployed a large number of artificial floating objects in the tropical oceans. Although such objects are referred to as Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), there is yet no strong evidence that fish do show an aggregative behaviour around them. The high probability of finding tuna around FADs may be the result of an aggregation process (high density of fish because fish stay for a long time around FADs) as well as an attraction process (high flow of fish through FADs). We analysed the movements of 14 yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, in relation to FADs moored in the Indian and Pacific Oceans (corresponding to all the published tracking data) to determine whether the observed movement patterns resulted from an aggregation or an attraction process. Tuna appeared to be attracted by FADs. In general, they did not stay for long close to the FADs reached, and so did not aggregate there. Some FADs may nevertheless act as Fish Aggregating Devices. The possible reasons why tuna associate with floating objects are discussed in the light of these results.

AB The minimalistic environment of standard laboratory cages can adversely influence the responses of animals in standard behavioural tests and other aspects of the animals' biology. To avoid this, cages should provide for the animals' species-specific behavioural characteristics. We hypothesized that, given their possible capacity for colour vision, laboratory mice, Mus musculus, would show preferences between cages of different colours. Studies show that environmental colour can influence emotionality and task performance in humans, suggesting that cage colour could also affect emotionality and performance of mice in behavioural tests. Seventy-two mice were housed in home cages painted red, black, green or white. Five weeks later, 24 mice were placed individually into an apparatus allowing them to choose between cages of each of the home cage colours. Each mouse showed a highly significant preference, which overall, was unrelated to home cage colour. White cages were most preferred and red were least. Home cage colour had a significant effect on body weight and food consumption as well as on behaviour in a raised plus maze. Mice from red home cages spent most time in the closed arms, indicating greater anxiety, possibly suggesting that the reduced occupancy of the red preference cages resulted from avoidance of environmental conditions that induced a negative mental state. These findings show that laboratory mice have strong preferences between cages of different colours. We also found that an apparently inconsequential environmental variable, home cage colour, can influence responses in standard behavioural tests, which should be considered in assessing the external validity of such tests.

AB Animals that rely on vocal communication must broadcast sound so that a perceptible signal is transmitted over an appropriate distance. We found that male blue-throated hummingbirds modified the amplitude of their vocalizations in response to both naturally occurring and experimenter-controlled changes in ambient noise levels. This phenomenon is known as the Lombard effect and may increase the efficiency of acoustic signalling. This study demonstrates the effect under natural field conditions and documents the first hummingbird species (Apodiformes: Trochilidae) to show this behaviour. We measured sound pressure levels (SPLs) of Serial Chip territorial advertisement calls across a natural range of ambient noise, primarily due to creeks within male territories. We found a significant correlation between the amplitude of Serial Chips and the amplitude of background noise. To test this relationship, we broadcast recordings of creek noise at high and low amplitudes while target individuals were producing Serial Chip vocalizations. We measured vocal SPLs before and during the playback. Individuals responded to changes in playback creek noise by changing the amplitude of Serial Chip production. We also measured transmission properties of Serial Chip calls through natural habitat to calculate the approximate amplitude of vocalizations at the position of the calling bird. We suggest that amplitude regulation of vocalizations contibutes to signal transmission distance along with the established relationships between singing behaviour, acoustic structure and habitat.

AB Investment in somatic and gametic resources may vary during the ontogeny of an organism. In the rock shrimp, Rhynchocinetes typus, males pass through several stages during ontogeny, and a dominance order reflects this developmental order (typus<intermedius<robustus). During mating in a competitive environment, subordinate males use a sneaking tactic characterized by rapid placement of many spermatophores, but dominant males transfer few spermatophores during matings. We therefore hypothesized that males in the different ontogenetic stages (1) invest differently in somatic and gametic growth and (2) differ in their ability to engage in multiple matings. The relative weight of the hepatopancreas (adjusted for total body weight), an organ related to somatic growth, was significantly lower in robustus males than in all other ontogenetic stages examined. The relative weight of the vas deferens (Vd), a measure of sperm reserves, was significantly higher in robustus males than in males in the other stages. In typus males that had mated once, the total weight of Vd was significantly lower than in unmated typus males, but no such difference was found in robustus males. All robustus males mated successfully with five females during 5 consecutive days, but many typus males failed to mate after the second or third day. Typus males that mated successfully with females placed significantly more spermatophores than did robustus males during the first mating but not in subsequent matings. The results suggest that robustus males, in contrast to typus males, can invest more in sperm production and due to their ability to defend a female, can use spermatic resources economically allowing them to mate with subsequent females. We conclude that, during ontogeny, R. typus males invest simultaneously in somatic and gametic growth in accordance with their mating behaviour and chance to mate. In this and other crustacean species, male resource investment during ontogeny thus may depend on their probabilities at different ontogenetic stages for obtaining mating opportunities.

AB Socioecological models for small mammals attempt to explain the causal relations between the spatiotemporal distributions of food resources, females and males. We tested their predictions for a wild population of Cavia magna, a grazing, precocial rodent, by analysing spacing behaviour in relation to various demographic features. Between May 1999 and January 2001 we collected capture-recapture data on 309 individuals and monitored 55 females and 49 males by radiotelemetry in periodically inundated wetland in Uruguay. Cavies showed a nonstationary use of space: monthly home ranges drifted over the whole study site. Female home ranges overlapped with those of several others. Females were randomly distributed and we found no evidence for socially mediated reproductive synchrony. Males ranged over larger areas than females, showing even less site fidelity, and also overlapped with several rivals. This basic spacing system remained stable over a wide range of densities and sex ratios. Independent of sex, animals used overlap zones randomly with respect to each other. Significant dynamic (spatiotemporal) interaction was most frequent between males and females. However, interaction analyses revealed no evidence for stable social bonds between animals, regardless of sex. We suggest that unpredictable female locations prevent males monopolizing females spatially. Because females are solitary, males could monopolize only one female by maintaining close proximity, rendering a roaming mating tactic more successful. Our findings point to a solitary 'social' system and overlap promiscuity as the likely mating system for the C. magna population studied.

AB We investigated the relation between visual and vocal attractiveness in women as judged by men. We recorded 34 women speaking four vowels and measured the peak frequency, the first five harmonic frequencies, the first five formant frequencies and formant dispersion. The women were also photographed (head shot), several body measures were taken and their ages were recorded. The voices were played to male judges who were asked to assess the women's age and vocal attractiveness from the recording. The men were then asked to assess the attractiveness of the photographs. Men were in strong agreement on which was an attractive voice and face; and women with attractive faces had attractive voices. Higher-frequency voices were assessed as being more attractive and as belonging to younger women (the lowest frequency produced is a good indicator of age in women in general). Larger women had lower voices and were judged as having less attractive faces and voices. Taller women had narrower formant dispersion as predicted. The results imply that different measures of attractiveness are in agreement and signal similar qualities, such as female age, body size and possibly hormonal profile.

AB Colonies of the greater sac-winged bat, Saccopteryx bilineata, consist of nonterritorial males and males that defend harem territories in which females roost. The traits of nonterritorial males that define their success in harem take-overs are so far unknown. We predicted that the time nonterritorial males spent in the colony and their proximity to harems would be important factors. We temporarily removed harem holders from a colony of 60 greater sac-winged bats on consecutive days and observed which of the nonterritorial males took over the harem. To test for consistency of results, we repeated the experiments in some of the territories. In a second set of experiments, we removed both the harem holder and the corresponding usurper from the first experiment. On average, usurping males preferred territories with a large harem over territories with a small harem and they belonged to groups of males who spent the daytime near the corresponding harems. Usurpers in the second experiment were present in the colony for a shorter time than usurpers in the first experiment. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that nonterritorial males form overlapping peripheral groups for harems and that they live in a hierarchy according to their tenure in the group. Group membership and hierarchy seemed to be the factors that determined whether a male occupied a vacant harem. Hence, instead of floating, the pattern of harem succession in greater sac-winged bats is best described by queuing of nonterritorial males for access to a harem.

   MECHANISM; EVOLUTION; INSECTS
AB Male sagebrush crickets, Cyphoderris strepitans, offer an unusual nuptial food gift to females during copulation: females feed on the hindwings of males and ingest haemolymph seeping from the wounds they inflict. Previous work has shown that females prevented from wing feeding during initial copulations are more receptive to subsequent matings than females permitted to wing feed. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that hormonal substances contained in the haemolymph of males, and ingested by females during copulation, function to decrease female receptivity to further matings. We tested this hypothesis by providing females, experimentally prevented from wing feeding, with male-derived haemolymph or appropriate control substances (female-derived haemolymph or cricket Ringer's solution), and recording their propensity to mate (in 1999) or remate (in 2000). Female mating propensity was not affected by ingestion of male haemolymph in either experiment. Although these results are inconsistent with the male manipulation hypothesis, it is possible that putative receptivity-inhibiting substances are sequestered in the integument of males' hindwings, rather than contained in male haemolymph per se. Alternatively, both the results of the present study and those of previous studies are consistent with the hypothesis that wing feeding leads simply to satiation of females, and thereby diminishes their motivation to seek out additional matings.

   HONEYBEES; DELAYS; TESTS; RULE
AB Normative models of choice usually predict preferences between alternatives by computing their value according to some criterion, then identifying the alternative with greatest value. An important consequence of this procedure is captured in the economic concept of rationality, defined through a number of principles that are necessary for the existence of an ordinal scale of value upon which organisms base their choices. Violations of these principles, such as some recently reported breaches of transitivity and regularity in birds and honeybees, have strong implications for the understanding of decision mechanisms in humans and nonhumans alike. We investigated rationality in risky choice using European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris. Birds had to choose between two or three food sources, each associated with a different variance in delay to reward. In three experiments, starlings were strongly risk prone, showing regular and consistent preferences in binary and trinary choices. Preferences also satisfied weak and strong stochastic transitivity. Our results extend the generality of previous research in risk-sensitive foraging to situations where more than two alternatives are present and suggest that violations of rationality in risk-sensitive choices may be expressed only under restricted sets of conditions.

AB Imitative learning, in which an individual learns to reproduce the behaviour pattern of another, has attracted considerable attention as a potentially powerful form of social learning. Despite extensive research, however, it has proved difficult to demonstrate in nonhuman animals. We investigated the ability of European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, to imitate the behaviour of a conspecific. Subjects watched a trained conspecific manipulating a plug for access to a food reward, using either a pushing or a pulling action. When later tested with the same apparatus these birds completed the task using the same action they had previously observed. In a second experiment, a separate group of starlings saw the plug move upwards or downwards automatically and a nearby conspecific obtain a food reward. When given access to the task these starlings failed to move the plug in the direction they had seen. Our experiment is an improvement on previous bidirectional control designs and provides strong evidence that starlings are capable of imitation. We advocate further use of this experimental design in attempts to demonstrate imitative learning. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In most species, both sexes may mate with more than one partner during their life. In terrestrial isopods (woodlice) female remating can occur within a reproductive season (immediate remating) or after a period of sexual rest and sperm storage, that is in a subsequent reproductive season (delayed remating). The pattern of sperm precedence is unknown in both cases. These two female remating patterns may shape male-male competition in different ways. To elucidate both patterns of female remating and sperm precedence, we used an albinism mutation in Armadillidium vulgare to track paternity in laboratory experiments. Males had low remating success after immediate remating attempts, mainly because of the female's refractory behaviour. However, refractory behaviour seemed to be lost after female sexual rest: delayed remating attempts were as successful as first mating attempts with virgin females. In both immediate and delayed remating, competing males had similar fertilization success, but varied in sperm precedence. We hypothesize that males might induce the refractory mating behaviour in females to ensure their paternity. This could be a strategy that evolved in woodlice after the loss of precopulatory mate guarding during adaptation to the terrestrial environment. We discuss the consequences of these findings for woodlice optimal mating strategies. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Prior tests of the grandmother hypothesis have suggested that postreproductive female Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata, do not significantly improve the survivorship of their descendents. However, not all postreproductive females are grandmothers, and not all grandmothers are postreproductive. In this study we looked at the daughters and grandchildren of 70 female Japanese macaques to assess the availability and adaptive value of reproductive and postreproductive mothers and grandmothers. We found that postreproductive Japanese macaque grandmothers are very rare. Only 2.8% of the sample of daughters had a postreproductive grandmother available when they began to reproduce, and only 4.2% of the reproductive life span of the daughter (less than 6 months for the average female) was spent with a postreproductive grandmother available to help the daughter. Grandchildren who survived to age 5 had a postreproductive grandmother available to them for only 4% of the first 5 years of life (i.e. a couple of months on average). The presence of a living mother, irrespective of her reproductive status, was associated with improved reproduction in her adult daughters, and the presence of a postreproductive grandmother was associated with significantly improved survivorship of grandchildren to age 1. While improved maternal investment does not appear to be the primary explanation for reproductive termination in Japanese monkeys, the few postreproductive females that have unweaned grandchildren available appear to have a positive influence on their survival.

AB When animals perceive social signals, information about the identity and the location of the signaller can be important determinants of a response by the perceiver. An unfamiliar individual often elicits a greater response than does a familiar individual. Similarly, a signal from an unexpected location may elicit a greater response than if it came from an expected location. For example, in field experiments on vocal communication in birds, an unexpected location has been many metres away from the expected one. Laboratory experiments on the responses of voles and hamsters to scent overmarks and on the habituation of hamsters to social scents suggest that much smaller differences in the location of odours may be salient. To explore this further, we examined the influence of changes in spatial location of familiar and novel male scents on responses of female golden hamsters, M. auratus. The spatial changes were about 9 cm, less than three-fourths of the body length of our subjects. The decline in females' investigation of the same male's flank odour across four habituation trials was not affected by changing the location of the odour. During test trials, however, changes in location did influence the results. The expected higher level of investigation of a novel scent versus that of a familiar one was observed primarily when the novel scent occupied a novel location. Such increases in investigation were usually not seen when only one of these variables was changed (individual or location). Thus, small changes in spatial location influence the salience of conspecific odours in this species. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB One foraging strategy that scavengers can employ to discover unpredictable food sources is to associate directly with predators who inadvertently provide food. The common raven, a well known feeding generalist, is also a prominent scavenger of wolves' kills and is found to be in close association with this predator. We tested the hypothesis that ravens preferentially associate with wolves in winter as a kleptoparasitic foraging strategy. The presence, absence and behaviour of ravens was documented during winter observations of wolves, coyotes, Canis latrans, and elk, Cervus elaphus, as well as the landscape in the absence of these three species. Ravens were found to be in close association with wolves when they were travelling, resting and hunting prey. In comparison, ravens showed no significant association with coyotes, elk or areas on the landscape in the absence of wolves. We also compared ravens' discovery success of wolf-killed and nonwolf-killed carcasses and their behavioural response upon discovery. Ravens found all wolf kills almost immediately and remained at the carcass to feed alongside wolves after the death of the prey. In contrast, ravens were less successful discovering experimentally placed carcasses in the same study region, and did not land or feed despite the availability of fresh, exposed meat. Our results show that ravens' association with wolves is not just an incidental and proximate by-product of the presence of fresh meat. Instead, we show that ravens preferentially associate with wolves in both the presence and absence of food, resulting in the discovery of carcasses and suppression of ravens' innate fear of novel food sources. Through this mode of social foraging, ravens may experience increased foraging efficiency in the use of an otherwise spatially and temporally unpredictable food source.

AB In the dimorphic dung beetle Onthophagus taurus major males provide assistance during offspring provisioning. We examined the behavioural dynamics of biparental care to quantify directly how males and females allocate time to parental and nonparental behaviours and to determine whether parents adjust their level of investment relative to their partner's contribution. Females allocated more of their time budget to parental behaviours than males. The proportion of time females allocated to parental behaviours increased after oviposition while that of a male decreased. Male paternity assurance behaviours were negatively associated with male and female parental behaviours. Theoretical models predict that the investment provided by the members of a cooperative pair should be negatively correlated and that any shortfall of one parent should be partially compensated for by the other. In-the absence of a male, unassisted females allocated more time to parental care, and performed more parental behaviours. However, compensation was incomplete as unassisted females performed fewer parental behaviours than pairs, resulting in significantly lighter brood masses (the egg and its associated dung supply). Males performed more parental behaviours when paired with small females, and small females more than large females. Contrary to prediction, the investments provided by males and females in a cooperative pair were positively correlated. Males coordinated their parental behaviours with the females rather than acting independently. Since parental behaviours were directly related to the weight of brood masses, the observed parental interactions will have important fitness consequences in this species., (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB In the Australian redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti, males typically use their paired copulatory organs (palps) to copulate twice with a single female then sacrifice themselves to their cannibalistic mates in a strategy that increases their paternity in that one mating, but leads to death. This type of terminal investment in one mating is predicted only if the expected value of future matings is low for males relative to the value of repeated mating with the same female. In this laboratory study, we quantified the reproductive value of mating more than once with the same female (repeated mating) and mating with more than one female (multiple mating) for male redback spiders. We tested two natural selection hypotheses for repeated mating, sperm limitation and reproductive insurance, but found no support for either hypothesis. We show that, in the absence of sperm competition or cannibalism, male lifetime reproductive output is the same whether a male copulates once, twice, or several times with a given female. Repeated mating does not increase the probability of successful fertilization, nor does it increase the number of offspring produced in successful matings. Although male repeated mating is not favoured because of increased fertility of mates, other studies suggest it may be important in sperm competition. Here we show that the relative reproductive value of the first two copulations is very high for redback males because they are functionally sterile after each palp has been used once; nonvirgin males are unable to father offspring. Functional sterility and repeated mating by male redbacks may be favoured by the same factors that lead to male sacrifice behaviour: ecological constraints on multiple mating combined with competitive benefits of maximal investment in the first mating.

AB Cooperative brood care is a rare phenomenon in spiders and is restricted to a few social species, including three in the genus Stegodyphus. Brood care in Stegodyphus begins with regurgitation feeding followed by matriphagy: the young consume the body fluids of their mother causing her to die quickly. Whether such an extreme form of maternal care can become a communal task should depend on physiological or historical preconditions. I investigated whether female Stegodyphus lineatus feed young or allow matriphagy according to their own reproductive state. Broods of young of two age classes (2 or 10 days after hatching) were isolated or fostered out to adult females that were unmated, had eggs or had young. Growth and survival of females and broods were followed over 21 days. The timing of matriphagy depended on the interaction between age of young and state of the foster mother. All broods that were fostered out to females with young grew and survived. Two-day-old young did not survive when isolated or fostered out to unmated females, but some survived and gained weight when placed with foster mothers that cared for egg sacs. Young of 10 days of age grew when fostered out to females with eggs but did not grow or lost weight when isolated or fostered out to unmated females. Survival among 10-day spiderlings was relatively high in all groups but differed significantly between treatments (young isolated or fostered out to unmated females or females with eggs) and control (left with the mother). The results show that these spiders will care for young from other females only when they are in the right developmental state. Such a constraint can have important consequences for the evolution of allomaternal care in social species: unless such a mechanism is overcome, nonreproductives cannot help in brood care.

AB In pied flycatchers females seem to prefer male territory quality rather than male characteristics, and the results of female mate choice experiments are divergent. In this outdoor aviary study, we examined how altering the ultraviolet reflection of males affects female mate choice behaviour. We chose pairs of males with similar human-visible dorsal colour and morphological traits. We then reduced the proportional ultraviolet reflectance in one male with sunscreen chemicals. The other male was treated with a chemical that slightly increased the ultraviolet reflectance of the plumage. In the experiment females clearly preferred males with slightly increased ultraviolet reflection. Our results indicate that pied flycatcher females use ultraviolet cues for mate choice when the effect of territory quality is controlled for. The results give us new information about a possible mechanism of mate assessment in this species, and indicate the importance of colour cues in avian mate choice behaviour.

AB Chorus tenure is the number of nights that a male anuran spends attending choruses, and dominant tenure is the number of nights that a male adopts a dominant (i.e. territorial) mating tactic. While male bullfrogs that have longer tenure (chorus tenure and dominant tenure) acquire more mates, tenure is believed to be energetically costly, During the summer of 1998, we tested the hypothesis that tenure of bullfrogs is energy constrained, by conducting a feeding experiment to manipulate energetic condition, and by measuring each male's body condition on every night of his chorus tenure. The energetic constraint hypothesis did not adequately predict variation in male chorus tenure. However, male bullfrogs with longer dominant tenures, other things being equal, were in better initial condition, poorer final condition and lost condition more slowly than males with shorter dominant tenures. Feeding had no significant effect on either chorus tenure or dominant tenure. We found evidence that direct selection through endurance rivalry favoured traits in male bullfrogs that increased tenure. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Many animals are gregarious and potentially benefit from the presence of conspecifics. We examined both den finding and den sharing by vulnerable juvenile Caribbean spiny lobsters, Panulirus argus, and compared three functional explanations of why lobsters might benefit from being gregarious. Lobsters sharing dens did not have higher survival than those in dens by themselves, suggesting that cooperative group defence may not be important at this life history stage. Lobsters in areas of high conspecific density did not have higher survival than those in areas of low density, suggesting that the dilution effect may not be important either. Den sharing provided no additional benefit beyond that provided by the shelter. However, lobsters were able to find shelter significantly faster when conspecific residents were already present in a den. This 'guide effect' benefits the shelter-seeking individual by reducing the time of exposure and associated predation risk. Habitat or risk assessment based solely on the presence of conspecifics may be a critical first step in the evolution of more complex social behaviours.

AB Eider females may abandon their young, care alone, or join in multifemale creches. We studied the characteristics of female eiders adopting these strategies in 1996-1999. Female condition at hatching varied significantly between years. Over all years, 31% of all females abandoned, 23% tended alone and 46% craned. In the year when average female condition at hatching was lowest, abandonment rate peaked (67%). Creching birds were further identified as true crechers staying more than 2 weeks with the original creche, and transient crechers leaving the creche. The condition of females shortly before hatching showed a decreasing trend, with lone tenders being in best condition, followed by true crechers, transient crechers and abandoners. Clutch size, date of hatching relative to the population median, and female body size did not differ between groups. Individual females switched between care modes between years. Females weighed significantly less when abandoning than when tending, with no significant weight difference when the females remained as tenders between 2 years. This is consistent with the energetic salvage strategy hypothesis, which states that females in poor body condition should be more prone to abandon their brood. Our results support an adaptive approach to offspring care behaviour in eiders, driven by female condition. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Previous studies have shown that guppies, Poecilia reticulata, can learn the route to a food source by shoaling with knowledgeable conspecifics, and prefer to shoal with experienced foragers and familiar fish. We tested the hypothesis that guppies would learn more effectively from (1) familiar than unfamiliar demonstrators and (2) well-trained than poorly trained demonstrators. Demonstrator fish were given experience in swimming a route to a food source and then introduced into shoals of untrained observer guppies; the spread of this foraging skill was recorded over 15 trials. The demonstrators were either familiar or unfamiliar to the observers and either well trained or poorly trained. Observers performed significantly better when the demonstrators were familiar. The training of the demonstrators made no overall difference to the performance of naive observers. However, whilst observers in shoals exposed to well-trained demonstrators did better initially than those with poorly trained ones, the latter learned the route to the feeder faster. Our results suggest that familiarity may generate a form of directed social learning in guppy shoals, in which fish learn more effectively from familiar conspecifics. An analysis of who follows whom suggests that well-trained demonstrators can provide a 'tip-off' as to the location of the hole but poorly trained demonstrators were more likely to be followed. The results suggest that while observers are able to shoal with poorly trained demonstrators, well-trained demonstrators swim the maze route too quickly to be followed, but may attract attention to the maze route.

AB Grey squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis, introduced from North America, have replaced red squirrels, S.: vulgaris, over much of Britain and parts of north Italy, but the reasons why are unclear. Spatial and temporal changes in the quantity and quality of their primary foods, namely tree seeds, may provide the focus for interspecific resource competition and hence go some way to explain the replacement process. To investigate whether grey squirrels have a competitive advantage over red squirrels, we used radiotelemetry and direct behavioural observations to examine the activity budget, foods, feeding behaviour and body condition of adult red squirrels in two mature, mixed-woodland sites in northern Italy, one site where there were only red squirrels, and one where both red and grey Squirrels were present. The studies were carried out between July 1996 and October 1998. We found few differences in the activity and foraging patterns and food choice of red squirrels with and without grey squirrels present, although we could not eliminate possible interspecific competition effects on food choice by red squirrels in summer (June-August) and autumn-winter (September-February). Foraging time and rate of energy intake of led squirrels in the mixed-species site were lower than in the red-only site in winter (December-February). This may have resulted from interspecific competition, but a more plausible explanation is that these site differences resulted from the distribution of preferred tree seeds and home range size. Overall, our results provide little support for the food competition hypothesis. Differences in body size between sites suggest that interspecific competition occurs during the growth phase of red squirrels, when juveniles and subadults disperse and look for a place to settle.

AB We assume that parents use the signalling intensity of their young to determine how much food they bring to the nest, and that the pattern of food allocation is determined by the signalling intensity and by the intensity of other nonsignalling behaviours that are not perceived by the parents. We explore different ways in which signalling, nonsignalling behaviours and competitive asymmetries might interact to determine food allocation. In Model 0 only signalling affects food allocation. More competitive chicks beg less and obtain a greater share of the food than their smaller siblings. In Model 1, a linear combination of signalling and nonsignalling behaviours determines food allocation. When nonsignalling behaviours are the main determinant of food allocation, chicks do not signal and parents deliver a fixed amount of food. Larger chicks receive a greater share of this food. When both types of behaviour are equally weighted, the pattern of investment depends on competitive asymmetry. For low asymmetry levels? both chicks invest in signalling. Por large asymmetries, the less competitive chick invests in signalling and the more competitive chick invests in nonsignalling behaviours. In Model 2, the product of signalling and nonsignalling intensities determines food allocation. Larger chicks invest more in signalling and less in nonsignalling behaviours. Larger chicks get more food than their siblings. Overall chicks waste more resources when signalling evolves. Hence, if natural selection could act on the mechanism of food distribution, we would expect signalling to play a minor role in the actual pattern of allocation of resources.

AB Vocal communication between zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, involves a variety of calls, as well as sang. One of these, the long sail, is exchanged between individuals in specific social contexts. Male long calls differ from the simpler unlearned long calls of females in one or more learned acoustic features: short, stable duration, elevated fundamental frequency and presence of fast frequency modulations. When species-specific long-call signals produced by male and female conspecifics were played back to adult male and female zebra finch subjects, the birds responded by calling. Males consistently responded much more to female long calls than to male long calls. Females also responded more to female long calls, but the effect was weaker. The responses of females had a correlation with stimulus duration that accounted for most of the higher response to female long calls. Males, like females, responded more to longer long calls, but also showed a step-like increment in responses to all female stimuli. Male birds effectively classified the stimuli by gender; females showed much weaker gender discrimination. The contributions of specific acoustic features to these discriminations were then explored by testing the birds with synthetic versions of natural calls and simplified sounds based on mathematical functions in which acoustic parameters could be independently specified. h Male birds showed response functions with changes at particular values of fundamental frequency stimulus duration and initial modulation frequency, suggestive of category boundaries within these parameters. Female response functions showed changes only for duration. When these response functions were used to predict responses to natural stimuli with given parameter values, the observed response patterns for natural stimuli in the two sexes were reproduced. The decisive gender categorization shown by males thus emerges from categorical evaluation of multiple stimulus parameters. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Individualistic behavioural traits have long been overlooked, dismissed as either noise or maladaptive deviation to atypical situations. We investigated individual variation in two strains of cloned red-spotted cherry salmon, Oncorhynchus masou macrostomus, in a series of experiments under laboratory conditions. Using principal component analysis, we found that their basic responses such as distance moved, space used and foraging mode grouped along five major dimensions; individuals could be discriminated from each other reliably and showed clear behavioural individuality. Interrelationships between behaviour patterns that differed between the two clonal strains suggested the potential for a genetic basis to behavioural individuality. One or two of the behaviour patterns explained intraclonal variation in individual growth histories. We conclude that behavioural individuality can have an adaptive significance.

AB Cognitive processes such as perception, learning, memory and decision making play an important role in mate choice, foraging and many other behaviours. In this review, I summarize a few key ideas about animal cognition developed in a recent book (Shettleworth 1998, Cognition, Evolution and Behaviour) and briefly review some areas in which interdisciplinary research on animal cognition is currently proving especially productive. Cognition, broadly defined, includes all ways in which animals take in information through the senses, process, retain and decide to act on it. Studying animal cognition does not entail any particular position on whether or to what degree animals are conscious. Neither does it entail rejecting behaviourism in that one of the greatest challenges in studing animal cognition is to formulate clear behavioural criteria for inferring specific mental processes. Tests of whether or not apparently goal-directed behaviour is controlled by a representation of its goal, episodic-like memory in birds, and deceptive behaviour in monkeys provide examples. Functional modelling has been integrated with analyses of cognitive mechanisms in a number of areas, including studies of communication, models of how predator learning and attention affect the evolution of conspicuous and cryptic prey, tests of the relationship between ecological demands on spatial cognition and brain evolution, and in research on social learning. Rather than a 'new field' of cognitive ecology, such interdisciplinary research on animal cognition exemplifies a revival of interest in proximate mechanisms of behaviour.

AB We observed the mating pattern and social behaviour of the pipefish Corythoichthys haematopterus in temperate waters of Japan during three successive breeding seasons. Males cared for a clutch in their brood pouch for 9-19 days until hatching and had several broods in the season with nonbrooding intervals of only 1 or 2 days. The population sex ratio was female biased and some females were always excluded from reproduction. Although males were sometimes courted by unmated females together with their regular partners, they always mated with the latter. The pair bond was maintained until the next season if both members survived. When males lost their partners, they remated with neighbouring unmated females within a few days. In contrast, widowed females remained unmated for a long time. Females had larger home ranges and were more active in courtship displays than males. This pipefish provides the first example of sex role reversal among monogamous syngnathid fish. We suggest that mate guarding by females is a primary proximate factor for maintenance of monogamy in this fish. (C) 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Avian duetting is a poorly understood phenomenon despite many hypotheses as to its function. Contrary to the recent view that duetting functions for mate guarding and is a result of conflict between the sexes, Australian magpie-larks, Grallina cyanoleuca, do not use duetting as a paternity guard. I used a playback experiment to investigate the role of antiphonal duetting in territorial defence and pair bond maintenance, two traditional hypotheses about the function of duetting. The experiment showed that, like many nonduetting species, magpie-larks recognize neighbours on the basis of song. It also provided evidence of functional differences between duetting and solo singing which indicate that temporal coordination of song between partners is used to maintain the territory and pair bond. Duets were more threatening territorial signals than solo songs: males initiated more vocalizations in response to playback of duets than playback of solos. Simulated intrusion also caused males and females to approach the speaker together and coordinate more of their vocalizations to form duets. Females did not engage in sex-specific territorial defence, responding equally strongly to playback of male and female song, and maintaining both territory and pair bond by attempting to exclude intruders of either sex. Males initiated more vocalizations in response to playback of male than female song, and their likelihood of duetting appeared to be related more to threats to the pair bond, in particular desertion by their partner.

AB Pod-specific calling behaviour of resident killer whales has been shown to include: discrete call types not shared among pods, different production rates of shared call types, and differences in the detailed structure of shared call types. To investigate the mechanisms leading to pod-specific calling, we compared the repertoire and structure of calls produced by three different matrilineal units within the same pod, and described call features encoding matrilineal-unit distinctiveness. The three matrilineal units had different production rates of shared calls, including one call type used almost exclusively by one matrilineal unit. Cross-validated discriminant function analyses revealed matrilineal-unit distinctive structure in five of the six shared call types examined, with duration of the terminal component being the most distinctive feature for all call types containing a terminal component. Calls generally consist of low- and high-frequency components that may follow different time-frequency contours. In our sample, a particular high-frequency contour was consistently paired with a particular low-frequency contour, both contours had roughly equal overall variability, and each contained independent matrilineal-unit distinctive information. The only call type that did not differ structurally between matrilineal units is reportedly used more in interpod meetings than in intrapod contexts. The differences in calling behaviour between matrilineal units were similar in form to previously described differences between pods, although more subtle. These results suggest that pod-specific calling behaviour in resident killer whales arises primarily as a consequence of accumulated drift or divergence between highly cohesive matrilineal units as they gradually separate into different pods.

AB White-crowned sparrows learn and produce multiple song types as juveniles, but most individuals stop singing all except one by the end of the first singing season. This single song type is generally maintained throughout adulthood. We demonstrate that, at the start of the second and subsequent singing seasons, this species can recall songs that had been deleted during the first singing season. The re-expression of song occurred in both the oriantha and the gambelii subspecies. Although all our males recrystallized the original song in the second year, our results indicate a mechanism for seasonal song change without new song memorization. The traditional dichotomy of closed-ended versus open-ended learning is inadequate for birds that learn early in life but can change their song output seasonally We suggest that species can exhibit a closed sensitive period for song memorization and first production, with the ability to recall deleted songs later in life. This type of learning, selective attrition followed by subsequent re-expression, may be used by some species currently considered open-ended learners.

TI Is there social transmission of feather pecking in groups of laying hen

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English

ID BURMESE FOWL; BEHAVIOR; POULTRY; BIRDS
AB Feather pecking is an abnormal behaviour where laying hens peck the feathers of conspecifics, damaging the plumage or even injuring the skin. If it occurs in a flock, more and more birds show it within a short period of time. A possible mechanism is social transmission. Several studies have shown that laying hen chicks, Gallus gallus domesticus, are able to modify their own behaviour when observing the behaviour of other chicks, for example, when feeding and foraging. As there is good experimental evidence that feather pecking originates from foraging behaviour, we hypothesized that feather pecking could also be socially transmitted. To test this, we reared 16 groups of 30 chicks. After week 4, the birds were regrouped into 16 groups of 20 chicks into each of which we introduced either five chicks that showed high frequencies of feather pecking or, as controls, five chicks that had not developed feather pecking. We then determined the feather-pecking rate and the frequency of ft,raging, dustbathing, feeding, drinking, preening, moving, standing and resting of all birds in a group. Data from the introduced birds were analysed separately and excluded from the group data. Chicks in groups with introduced feather-pecking chicks had a significantly higher feather-pecking sate than chicks in the control groups. In addition, birds in groups with introduced feather peckers showed significantly lower foraging frequencies than those in the control groups, although the housing conditions were identical and there were no differences in either the number or the quality of the stimuli relevant to foraging behaviour. The study therefore suggests that feather pecking is socially transmitted in groups of laying hen chicks. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI Stimulus enhancement in greylag geese: socially mediated learning of an

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

ID LAYING HENS; IMITATION; TRANSMISSION; PIGEONS; RATS
AB We recently observed the spreading of a novel tradition in a flock of semiferal greylag geese,Anser anser: an increasing number of individuals began to bite and chew the stems of butterbur, Petasites hybridus. Because this behaviour spread particularly fast within families, social learning seemed to be involved. We therefore designed an experiment with hand-reared goslings, which were socially imprinted on humans, to investigate whether and how the observation of an experienced tutor affects the acquisition of a novel skill. Goslings had to open the gliding lid of a box to get at a food reward, To each of seven hand-reared observers a human tutor demonstrated where and how to open the lid, whereas seven controls remained untutored. All observers learned to perform the task but only one of the controls succeeded. The observers explored more often at the position shown by the tutor than elsewhere and seemingly learned by trial and error. In contrast, control birds explored primarily at positions that did not allow them to open the box. These results indicate that in greylag goslings the observation of an experienced model facilitates the learning of an operant task. We conclude that stimulus enhancement followed by operant conditioning were the mechanisms involved, which may have accounted for the fast spread of the stem-chewing tradition between family members.

AB Communal nesting, the sharing of parental responsibilities between multiple individuals in a nest, is common in many rodents. Upon first glance, this behaviour seems to be selectively disadvantageous. Communal care not only involves energetic costs, but may also be subject to cheating behaviour. Despite abundant literature, many questions remain regarding advantages gained by females that form nesting groups. I discuss the communal nesting of eusocial, singular and plural breeding rodents. I first clarify the distinction between communal nesting and thermoregulatory huddling. I then review two major groups of hypotheses ('ecological constraints' and 'benefits of philopatry') that are used to explain the occurrence of communal nesting in rodents. Most likely, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Regardless of the main selective pressure(s) acting on communal nesting, the indirect components of inclusive fitness that result from nest sharing most likely influence the formation and maintenance of communal nests. Communal nesting and nursing (the sharing of milk with nonoffspring) are under different selective regimes and thus, must be evaluated separately. I review adaptive and nonadaptive hypotheses for rodent communal nursing. I argue that communal nursing may not be adaptive as mothers may be forced to share milk with nonoffspring in large communal nests (i.e. communal nursing may be a cost associated with communal nesting). In conclusion, I propose directions for future study that may improve our understanding of communal nesting and nursing in the wild. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Most evolutionary analyses of animal communication suggest that low-cost signals can evolve only when both,the signaller and the recipient rank outcomes in the same order. When there is a conflict of interest between sender and receiver, honest signals must be costly. However, recent work suggests that low-cost signals can be evolutionarily stable, even when the sender and the receiver rank outcomes in different orders, as long as the interest in achieving coordination is sufficiently great. In this paper, we extend this body of work by analysing a game theory model that shows that low-cost signals can evolve when there are conflicts of interest and no interest in coordination, as long as individuals interact repeatedly. We also present,an empirical example indicating that female rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, use honest, low-cost, vocal signals to facilitate interactions when conflicts of interest exist.

AB We studied the short-term vocalization rates of fallow bucks to determine the primary recipients of the signal conveyed by these rates. We used the contexts in which groans occurred:to investigate whether the signal represented an intrasexual threat or an intersexual advertisement: We found that fallow buck groaning rates were highly variable and that this variation was associated with the contexts of groaning. Groaning rates were higher during the rut than during the prerut, and also higher when males were with females than when they were with other males. Males with females groaned at higher rates when other vocal males were nearby. We identified a postcopulation call that consisted of the highest groaning rates that males produced. The presence of a harem did not contribute to the variation in groaning rates, except to a minor extent in postcopulation rates. Our findings suggest that the signal transmitted by short-term vocalization rates is primarily a threat aimed at other males. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The effects of parasites on host fitness and the fitness effects of maternal effects are widely discussed. In this study, I conducted an experiment linking both aspects. I manipulated the ectoparasite load (Acari: Arrenurus cuspidator) of damselflies, Coenagrion puella, and found that larvae from mothers with high parasite loads were larger (assessed by head width) than larvae from mothers with low parasite loads. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between the number of eggs laid and parasite load. Parasitized mothers thus seemed to have fewer, but probably better, offspring. The ecological significance of these parasite-mediated maternal effects remains to be tested. However, size-dependent cannibalism almost certainly has important consequences for population dynamics.

AB We compared the influence of recent feeding history on locomotory behaviour in two species of wolf spiders, Hogna helluo (Walckenaer) and Pardosa milvina Hentz, in the laboratory. Both species are cursorial hunters. We maintained the spiders in the laboratory on satiation and stringent feeding regimes and measured their locomotory activity levels for 1 h using a digital activity recording device. We subjected H. helluo to either ad libitum feeding for 14 days or no food for 14 days. We subjected P. milvina to ad libitum feeding or fasting treatments for 7 and 14 days. We found that H. helluo showed a shift in locomotory activity depending on feeding regime, whereas P. milvina did not. Food-limited H. helluo travelled further than satiated H. helluo, and did so by moving more frequently. Pardosa milvina was in general much more active than H. helluo. We propose that P. milvina is an active forager compared with the sit-and-wait strategy of H. helluo. This difference in foraging strategy is correlated with differences in body size and habitat use.

AB We examined relationships between individual differences in antipredator behaviour and prey morphological characters (size, shape) that influence prey vulnerability. Behavioural responses of Physa gyrina to chemical cues associated with predation by crayfish Orconectes rusticus, were assayed in the laboratory for 6 days over a 13-day period. Snails displayed consistent, individually repeatable responses to the predation cues, including hiding (refuge use) and substratum avoidance (crawling to the water surface or out of the water). We assessed shell morphology using morphometric techniques that isolate geometrically independent components of size and shape variation corresponding to aperture width and apertural obstruction. Previous studies indicate that large size, narrow apertures and obstructed apertures reduce morphological vulnerability to the shell-entry predation tactics used by crayfish. In the present study, small, and thus more vulnerable, prey tended to show stronger antipredator behaviour than large prey (i.e. behavioural compensation for morphological vulnerability). In contrast, behavioural and shape-based defences were positively correlated; snails with narrow apertures showed strong antipredator responses. We refer to this 'double defence' against predators as cospecialization. With either compensation or cospecialization, suites of correlated behavioural or morphological traits must be studied in tandem to understand the adaptive value of prey responses to predators.

AB Animals often increase their apparent willingness to incur risk when foraging in groups, presumably because group membership reduces an individual's risk of predation. As group size increases, however, competition for resources may also increase, resulting in a decrease in the quantity of resources available to each member of the group. When resources are scarce, individuals might be expected to increase their foraging effort in an attempt to increase their share. Such increases in effort will often appear to increase an individual's risk of predation. Thus, increased competition may contribute to the frequently observed relationship between risk-taking behaviour and group size. To date, no experimental assessment of the relative importance of these Two mechanisms exists. We argue;that to differentiate between the hypotheses of 'risk reduction' and 'increased competition', it is necessary to quantify the effect of predation risk on the form of the relationship between group size and risk-taking behaviour, and thus, to manipulate both group size and predation risk. We conducted an experiment to determine the relative importance of risk reduction and increased competition to the foraging decisions of juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch. We recorded the foraging behaviour of 18 focal individuals in the presence and absence of a predator, and in the company of zero, one and three conspecifics. As group size increased from one to four, focal fish captured more prey items, ventured closer to the feeder (and predator) to intercept them, and decreased their use of cover. Furthermore, although focal individuals captured fewer prey items and intercepted them further from the feeder in the presence of the predator than in its absence, the form of the relationship between risk-taking behaviour and group size was not affected by the level of predation risk. The results of our experiment are consistent with the interpretation that increases in risk-taking behaviour with group size occurred primarily as a consequence of increased competition for scarce resources.

AB Manipulation of the operational sex ratio (OSR) in guppies, Poecilia reticulata, causes changes in male-male competition and female mate choice. In this study OSR is defined as the number of sexually active males divided by the total number of sexually active adults of both sexes. The rate of male courtship displays decreased, and interference behaviours between males increased, at male-biased OSRs. The OSR influenced both copulatory tactics and postcopulatory guarding. All copulations followed sigmoid displays, except at an OSR of five males to one female where 60% of copulations occurred during sneak attempts. Compared with copulations that followed sigmoid displays, successful sneak copulations were followed by a shorter period of postcopulatory mate guarding and a shorter refractory period before males resumed courtship activities. Females preferred males with more orange colour whenever they had a choice, and the preference for orange colour was stronger with more male-biased OSRs. The OSR thus influences the presence, absence or relative importance of both female mate choice and male-male competition which, in turn, should affect the evolution of secondary sexual traits.

TI Black-capped chickadee call dialects along a continuous habitat corridor

ID PARUS-ATRICAPILLUS; SONG DIALECTS; VOCALIZATION; CONVERGENCE
AB The gargle call, a vocalization us ed in agonistic encounters by black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, was examined for evidence of geographical variation along a corridor of continuous riparian habitat in northern Colorado. We captured birds from three different sites during the nonbreeding season and brought them into the laboratory, where their gargle calls were recorded. We sorted sonagrams produced from these vocalizations visually into distinct gargle types having similar compositions of individual units, or syllables. This allowed us to characterize both individual and population repertoires. The majority (88.7%) of gargle types analysed were found to be unique to individual populations rather than shared among or between populations. Examination of individual repertoires showed that chickadees shared a higher proportion of gargle types with birds from their own sites compared with birds from either of the two other sites. Thus, gargle dialects occurred among these chickadee population despite the absence of geographical barriers to blending of vocal traditions. As the birds studied were obtained from sites along an uninterrupted dispersal corridor, the results of this study suggest that behavioural mechanisms are responsible for maintenance of dialects in this aggressive call.

AB Mirror images simulating social partners that cooperated or defected have been used as an experimental method to test the hypothesis that, while inspecting a predator, pairs of fish play a conditional strategy, Tit for Tat, in an iterated version of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Using this method, we found that predator inspection was more likely to occur when the mirror image was visible on the left rather than on the right side of mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki. The same occurred even when a videorecorded stimulus presentation was used, in which sequences of the predator were mixed with their mirror-image equivalents, thus showing that the asymmetry was not due to behavioural or morphological asymmetries of the predator itself. Moreover, irrespective of whether they were tested with a cooperative (parallel mirror) or a defecting (angled mirror) partner, mosquitofish drew closer to the predator when the mirror was on their left side. These findings suggest that the images seen on the right and left sides by a fish may evoke different types of social behaviour, probably because of differing modes of analysis of perceptual information carried out by the left and right sides of the brain; accurate control and balancing of the side of presentation of visual stimuli during behavioural experiments thus appears to be crucial.

AB We investigated how parental provisioning and nestling departure behaviour interact to produce prefledging mass recession in Cassin's auklets, Ptychoramphus aleuticus. Under our hypothesis, auklet parents are reluctant provisioners and should be increasingly likely to terminate or reduce provisioning of their single nestling as it matures. For the nestling, remaining in the nest presents a risk of losing mass (if the parent does not provision) but also a possibility of additional provisioning. As the nestling matures and becomes increasingly capable of independence, the benefits of remaining in the nest decrease and nestlings should be increasingly likely to fledge. Nestlings also should be more likely to fledge when the expectation of additional provisioning is low. Data on parental provisioning (based on growth increments) and nestling departure were consistent with our hypothesis. Older and heavier nestlings had smaller growth increments than younger and lighter nestlings, suggesting that parents were reluctant to provision old and heavy nestlings. Older and heavier nestlings also were increasingly likely to fledge. We hypothesized that nestlings might use the intensity of mass loss to gauge parental reluctance to provision, and accordingly, nestlings were increasingly likely to fledge after experiencing a greater amount of mass loss.

ID MELES-MELES; EUROPEAN BADGER; BEHAVIOR; ENVIRONMENT; SETTS
AB Group living has potential costs in terms of relative fitness for individuals that invest effort in activities providing general benefit, if other competing individuals exploit those activities and accrue similar benefits at no cost. We examined the roles of individual badgers, Meles meles, in the den maintenance activities of digging and bedding collection at their communal setts. Twenty per cent of adults and yearlings were responsible for 60-90% of the observed digging and bedding collection effort. Overall males tended to dig more than females, while durations of bedding collection were similar. Among adult and yearling males and females, individuals with a high percentage of days observed at the set (high site fidelity) performed more digging and collected more bedding than transients and badgers of low site fidelity. Males of high status (large, mature, frequently copulating individuals) were more likely to dig than males of low status. Principal component analysis indicated negligibly low correlation between status and site fidelity for males. We hypothesize that while highly resident adult females benefit from extending the sett to avoid direct reproductive competition, males of high status and site fidelity might extend the sett to encourage receptive breeding females in their home group to stay and/or to improve survivorship of sired litters. Other categories of individual depend on the sett for shelter but, perhaps having less to gain from extending it, adopt a less active role in sett maintenance.

   SPERMATOPHORE; COPULATION; BEHAVIOR
AB When sperm donation is costly, insemination is reciprocal and ejaculate size is a good predictor of an individual's reproductive state, internally fertilizing hermaphrodites are expected to donate more sperm when they receive more, resulting in sperm trading by volume. We compared the amounts of sperm exchanged reciprocally between partners of the planarian flatworm Dugesia gonocephala. In the field, mating individuals had more self sperm, but were less allosperm depleted than nonmating individuals. Larger individuals also had more self sperm and transferred more sperm. Although individuals mated assortatively by size, self sperm reserves were not correlated within pairs. Nevertheless, mating partners exchanged similar amounts of sperm, even after correcting for self sperm availability. Hence, individuals give more sperm not only when they have more, but also when they receive more. This is the first indication that sperm trading by volume occurs in a simultaneous hermaphrodite with mutual penis intromission. It appears to be achieved by both partners donating sperm until the partner with the lowest self sperm reserves finishes ejaculation and completes spermatophore transfer. In response, the other partner ends sperm donation as well, and transfers its spermatophore with only a short delay. The evolution of conditional sperm exchange in this species may be explained by the fact that male mating rate is limited owing to the time needed to replenish self sperm reserves.

AB Small birds should localize sound poorly because small head size limits azimuth resolution and because the loose correlation of acoustic degradation with distance limits accurate estimation bf auditory distance. We determined the accuracy of sound localization by a passerine bird in the field using an open-loop phonotaxis experiment. After hearing a playback of a conspecific contact call, eastern towhees, Pipilo erythrophthalmus, approached the silenced source. Mean auditory distance resolution was 7% of total speaker distance and mean azimuth resolution was +/-5 degrees. In a second experiment, we played birds the same calls rerecorded previously over the 10- or 20-m distance beyond each playback location. In 13 of 30 trials, the birds over-flew the speaker by a distance propotional to rerecorhing; but in 15 trials, approach distances were comparable to speaker distance despite the addition of distance simulated by attenuating-and rerecording the calls. Signal-specific and location-specific distance cues are-derived to explain the bimodal distribution of flight distances we observed. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Males of the butterfly Pararge aegeria defend sun spot territories on the forest floor as a strategy to locate females: the defence involves a spiral flight between two competing males. The success of any particular fight has been interpreted as following the simple rule 'resident wins, intruder loses' as predicted by game theory models. Here we use field experiments to show that temperature has a marked effect on the territorial defence of these ectothermic insects. The spiral flights were true contests, not conventional signals, so the flight endurance of the butterflies was an important factor in determining the result of the contest. Butterflies that were warmer could fly for longer and were more likely to win a contest; therefore temperature was an important component of contest asymmetry, and resident butterflies that increased their body temperatures by basking in sun spots were more likely to win than the intruding males which might have cooled down during flight around the site. The rule that the resident always wins is not disputed, however, the causal factors underpinning the rule are questioned. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID FEMALE SPARROWS; RESPONSIVENESS; PLASMA
AB We explored the conditions under which playbacks of male zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, song induced reproduction in females. In a laboratory study, a rise in faecal oestrogen levels predicted egg laying. Song playbacks by themselves induced a decrease in oestrogen levels. There was an increase in oestrogen levels, followed by egg laying, when the song was broadcast from inside a male model positioned away from the nest. However, this effect occurred only when a second, silent male model was perched on the rim of the nest. If song was broadcast from inside the model perched on the nest, there was no increase in oestrogen levels. We conclude that tests of song efficacy in female songbirds must respect some contextual rules, which are likely to vary between species. Only then does it become possible to ascertain which sounds are most effective in inducing physiological changes leading to reproduction. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID APIS-MELLIFERA L; KIN RECOGNITION; SOCIAL WASPS; DISCRIMINATION;
   HYDROCARBONS
AB We addressed the general question of how kin recognition cues develop by investigating cue differentiation between colonies of the honey bee, Apis mellifera. In honey bee colonies, exposure to the wax comb is a critical component of the development of kin recognition cues. In this study, we determined how the cues develop under natural conditions (in swarms), whether the genetic source and age of the wax affect cue ontogeny, and whether exposure to wax, as in normal development, affects preferential feeding among bees within social groups. Cue development in swarms coincided with wax production, rather than with the presence of brood or the emergence of new workers; this finding supported previous observations concerning the importance of wax in cue ontogeny. Effective cue development required a match between the genetic source of the workers attempting to enter the hive, the wax to which they were exposed, and the guards at the hive entrance. The wax must also have been exposed to the hive environment for some time. Cues gained from wax did not mask or override cues used in preferential feeding interactions; this finding supports the contention that two recognition systems, one for nestmate recognition and the other for intra-colonial recognition, are present. The results fit a general model for cue development in nestmate recognition that relies on the use of nesting materials as an intermediary; the evolutionary significance of this model is discussed.

AB The influence of food abundance on whitethroats' behaviour when preparing for autumn migration was investigated in a feeding experiment on the island of Gotland in the Baltic. Whitethroats attracted to a feeding site during post-juvenile moult attained a stable body mass 1.4 g higher than birds in natural conditions. This fuel load is well below the maximum that whitethroats could deposit. After maintaining stable body mass during moult, the whitethroats started to gain mass and thereafter soon departed on migration. This shift was due to the birds increasing their gross food intake by about 70%. Both the average rate of fuel deposition (about 7% of lean body mass per day) and the average departure fuel load (over 50% of lean body mass) were much higher for birds at the feeding site than for birds in natural conditions. No correlation between rate of fuel deposition and departure fuel load was found at the feeding place. Larger departure fuel loads in late individuals suggest that departure decisions are affected by temporal cues. Comparisons with models of time-minimization during migration show that the lack of correlation between rate of fuel load and departure load contradicts the predictions in one model. In another model, where a finite distance is included, the relationship between rate of fuel deposition and departure fuel load is predicted to be step-wise. This means that within certain ranges of rate of fuel deposition the departure fuel load should not change, which is consistent with the result found in this study.

AB During vocal interactions birds can time their song output so that their songs overlap those of a conspecific. Such overlapping is usually interpreted as a directed signal of arousal or as a signal of readiness to escalate contests. Inevitably, these interactions can often be heard by other conspecifics. To investigate if these conspecifics would perceive and use information derived from listening to others' interactions we conducted playback experiments in the field on male territorial nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos. We tested whether asymmetric interactions, in which one bird overlaps the song of another individual, influences the behaviour of additional, passive conspecific receivers. To test the influence of song overlapping on a third individual, each subject received one playback treatment in which two intruders were simulated by a dual speaker playback design. Songs broadcast from one loudspeaker overlapped those from the other loudspeaker. Subjects responded more intensely at the side of the overlapper than at the side of the loudspeaker from which the song that was overlapped was broadcast. These differences in response persisted in a second test in which songs of only one of the formerly interacting rivals were played. The results suggest that, even if song overlapping is a signal directed towards the singer whose song is overlapped, this information is perceived and used by additional receivers. Such information on rivals' behaviour during an interaction might help an individual decide which strategies to adopt in possible future interactions with these conspecifics.

AB The harderian gland secretions of mole-rats, Spalax ehrenbergi, usually released by self-grooming, include odorous substances which are sex dependent. Male secretions were the most attractive to both sexes, while female secretions were attractive to males but not to other females. The rate of attacks by females towards intact males was higher than towards males whose harderian gland had been removed. However, grooming by intact male mole-rats decreased the rate of attacks by their opponents, while grooming by males without harderian glands did not; thus the male harderian secretions appear to have appeasement qualities. Grooming by females with and without harderian glands failed to reduce aggression. Unlike intact males, those without harderian glands had almost no volatiles on their fur, and thus are probably not considered to be a threat to conspecifics. Gas chromatography spectra showed that substances of harderian origin were added to the fur during grooming. Some of these substances remained on the fur long after the animal ceased grooming, and appear to give the animal its specific odour, but some volatile substances peaked briefly after grooming, and were probably responsible for the decline of aggression that occurred after grooming. Although grooming has long been considered to be a displacement activity, we suggest that in the mole-rat its performance is too risky to be merely this, and it has acquired the meaning of appeasement through the release of chemical cues.

AB This paper analyses the behaviour of lactating female outbred mice, Mus musculus domesticus, in the presence of male conspecific odours. When olfactory cues were left in the environment by a sexually naive adult male, a potentially infanticidal animal, the mother took longer to reach her litter following 30 min of separation. Odours left by the sexual partner, by an unknown male of parental status, or by a young naive male did not modify the mother's behaviour, compared with the control situation (absence of male odour). The number of ultrasonic calls of pups varied according to the characteristics of the male but did not modify the behaviour of the dam. Females took longer to reach pups on day 8 of lactation than on days 4 or 12. We suggest adaptive reasons why females take longer to reach pups when the situation is more risky. We tested the hypothesis that the loss of an 8-day-old litter is more expensive, in term of the mother's future reproductive success, than the loss of younger and older litters. Females conceived a new litter wit:hin a few days (the inter-birth interval varied according to the age of the litter previously removed) but, even though no difference in size and weight of litters was recorded, females that had the litter removed on day 8 postpartum (compared with days 4 and 12) suffered from a higher mortality rate in the next litter. We suggest that the time the mother takes to reach her pups in the presence of a potentially infanticidal male could represent a measure of parental investment.

AB Mate choice is defined as a behavioural pattern in one sex which increases the probability of fertile matings with certain members of the opposite sex. The chosen sex may use force, however, to coerce matings from reluctant members of the choosing sex. In a confined group of Japanese macaques, Macaca fuscata fuscata, housed at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University, Japan, behavioural and endocrine data were combined to assess the validity of several mate-choice behaviours and the potential influence of sexual coercion. Preliminary evidence was found for both female mate choice of males and male sexual coercion of females. Both female proximity maintenance towards males and male aggression towards females were correlated with an increase in fertile matings. Most male aggression appeared to be the by-product of increased time spent in proximity due to female proximity maintenance, but some male aggression appeared to be sexual coercion. These results are interpreted in light of recent research on male sexual coercion, and a tentative model of mate choice for this species is proposed.

AB Investment ratios in held populations of the European beewolf, Philanthus triangulum F. (Hymenoptera, Sphecidae), are strongly biased towards males. Possible explanations are conditional sex allocation and/or constraints on provisioning females: daughters need at least three prey items (honey bees), whereas sons need only one to develop and reproduce. If small females are not able to procure these three bees quickly enough they might have to produce sons instead. Larger females had a higher proportion of successful hunting flights, carried heavier loads, and could fly continuously with a load for longer than small females. They brought in more and heavier bees but needed less time for a single hunting trip. An estimate of the sex allocation of the food bees, based on the timing pattern of successful hunting trips, suggested that female size is positively correlated with the proportion of daughters produced. However, this effect explains only a small part of the overall variation in investment ratio. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ID BEHAVIOR; FISHES; SCHOOL
AB Field observations of the different physiological colour patterns (PCPs) of juvenile bullet head parrotfish, Chlorurus sordidus, were conducted at three sites around Lizard Island, Australia. The aim of the study was to quantify, using log-linear analysis, the influence of simultaneously interacting variables upon the PCPs shown by this species in the field. It was proposed that features of an individual, such as body size (total length) and schooling behaviour (schooling/not schooling), as well as foraging activity (feeding/not feeding), were influential in PCP determination. In addition, the influence of time of day was considered. Overall, an individuals body size was the most significant factor, being over six times more important than foraging activity in determining the PCP displayed. The schooling behaviour of an individual was 40% more important than foraging activity in PCP determination. Furthermore, the correlation between body size and PCP was itself dependent on time of day whilst both foraging activity and schooling behaviour were independent of time of day. The systematic methodology used enabled interactions between variables to be ranked numerically and their biological significance to be discussed. The results present correlational evidence that PCPs may function for anti-predator purposes and provide the basis for future studies into the function of PCPs in juvenile C. sordidus.

AB Two experimental studies are reported which investigate the social learning of foraging information in guppies, Poecilia reticulata. In both cases, untrained adult female guppies swam with trained conspecifics to feed, and in the process learned a route to a food source. In experiment 1, subjects were given 5 days experience swimming with demonstrator fish trained to take one of two equivalent routes to food. When tested alone, subjects preferentially used the route of their demonstrators. Experiment 2 investigated whether this social learning could mediate the stable transmission of route preferences among small populations of fish. This experiment used a transmission chain design, in which fish in small founder populations were trained to take one of the two routes, with founder members gradually replaced by untrained conspecifics. Three days after all founder members had been removed, populations of untrained fish still maintained strong preferences for the routes of their founders. The results suggest that the tendency to shoal may facilitate a simple form of guided social learning, which allows guppies to learn about their local environments. They also imply that selectively neutral behavioural alternatives may be maintained as traditions in aggregated animal populations by very simple social mechanisms. The transmission chain method may be particularly useful for studying social species, such as the guppy, that do not respond well to isolation testing.

AB It is necessary to identify the sender and receiver of a signal to understand the complete function of a signal system. In the Down-Up display of the male mallard. Anas platyrhynchos, identifying the recipient of the display is often difficult. Often given in synchronous bouts, the Down-Up display is thought to function either for courtship or appeasement, but the appeasement function is considered rare. Data presented here of the orientation of the mallard Down-Up display reveal that this function is in fact common. Down-Up displays given early in a bout are directed towards a female; Down-Up displays occurring later in a bout tend to be directed towards the first male of the bout to display. The high frequency of this second orientation prompts reinterpretation of several phenomena long known in the literature. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Species in which females possess conspicuous structures important in olfactory, auditory or visual signalling are rare. These structures are found in several taxonomically disparate vertebrate groups, however, suggesting that the phenomenon of conspicuous female signalling may have arisen on multiple independent occasions. Where females compete for reproductive access to males, inter-sexual and intra-sexual selection acting on females may explain these characters. Where males compete for access to females, conspicuous signals may incite male-male competition, and perhaps lead to greater sperm competition, to the genetic advantage of females. Alternatively, conspicuous female signals may deflect male attention when females are gravid with eggs or embryos, and so reduce female costs of reproduction.
   Bright red throat coloration was examined in females of the tropidurid lizard Microlophus occipitalis. Intensity of red-throat coloration was correlated with reproductive state and changes in female behaviour, including reduced movement and feeding rates and an increased likelihood of responding to male courtship with 'rejection' displays. Males courted red-throated females at lower rates and with lower intensity than they courted white-throated females. Males competed for access to females but did not compete more intensely for females of any particular throat colour. During the breeding season, high female mortality rates and reduced rates of movement and feeding in gravid females were observed. Together, these data suggest that females signal to deflect male attention when they are gravid. In this species, female signalling may be maintained by the reduction of costs such as increased predation or energetic costs associated with male attention.

AB Mus domesticus usually exists commensally with humans, often reaching high densities in areas containing concentrated food resources. Mus spretus exists in vegetational habitats with generally scattered and seasonal food supplies. Two behavioural mechanisms could be responsible for determining their spatial dispersion: (1) resident territory holders aggressively exclude intruders from attractive areas (aggressive exclusion hypothesis), or, (2) animals spread out to exploit scattered resources and avoid dominant competitors occupying preferred sites (avoidance of dominant competitors hypothesis). Previous results from M.spretus supported the avoidance of dominant competitors hypothesis. An identical series of tests were repeated on commensal M. domesticus to allow direct comparison of the competitive behaviour of the two species. While M. spretus are strongly attracted to nest sites containing conspecific odour and, subsequently, are more aggressive towards the owner than towards another unfamiliar conspecific, M. domesticus showed no such attraction or discrimination. In neutral (clean) enclosures, M. domesticus dyads were more aggressive than M.spretus dyads, while the opposite was true when one opponent had been resident for Is h. In a resident's enclosure, resident status determined which M. domesticus individual was aggressive, resulting in significant differentiation in competitive behaviour between resident and intruder. No such differentiation was found within M.spretus dyads, where relative weight was the important factor determining aggressive behaviour. Results from M. domesticus support the aggressive exclusion hypothesis, suggesting that there may be important differences between Mus species, or between environments, in the social behaviour that underlies their spatial dispersion.

AB Many sexual ornaments are signals commonly used in both sexual selection contexts: mate choice and intra-sexual competition. Previous studies show that female choice in ring-necked pheasants, Phasianus colchicus, is influenced by features of some male ornaments. Experiments and correlational data were used in this study to investigate the role of male ornaments in male-male agonistic encounters. Some traits used by females in mate choice, namely tail length and black points in the wattle, had no effect in male-male competition, but the length of ear tufts had a role in both contexts. The most important traits appeared to be the head ornaments, which include ear tufts, but also wattle size. Head ornaments function as coverable signals that are displayed to rival males informing about readiness to fight, fighting ability and resource-holding power; and the total time spent displaying correlated with testosterone level, physical condition and rank.

AB The social organization of Japanese serows was studied in a 320-ha forest for 7 years. Serows were usually solitary (79% of sightings), but temporally formed groups of two to four animals (mostly mother-kid units, or male-female pairs with or without a kid). Home ranges of adult males and adult females (10-15 ha) were stable, and most parts of the ranges were defended as territories against other individuals of the same sex throughout the year. Several adult males were non-territorial residents. The main mating unit consisted of a monogamous pair of which the male's range almost completely overlapped the female's. About 20% of territorial males were polygynous each year, their ranges overlapping the ranges of two females; they could produce nearly twice as many offspring as monogamous males. Mating units were usually maintained for several years, although polygynous groups were not as stable as monogamous pairs. Female territories, which function to defend food resources, were dispersed and seemed to restrict the number of mates available to territorial males. This is why the serow formed predominantly monogamous pairs, although the male's strategy is polygyny. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB Chemosensory recognition of predators by naive prey may be facilitated if the predator's diet chemically 'labels' the predator. In a laboratory experiment, behaviour patterns were quantified in individual damselfly larvae, Enallagma spp., that had never been exposed to pike, Esox lucius, before and after exposing the damselflies to one of three chemical stimuli: water from a tank that held pike fed a diet of (1) damselflies, (2) fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, or (3) mealworms, Tenebrio molitor. Damselflies decreased their frequency of feeding bites, head bends and moves in response to stimuli from pike fed damselflies and pike fed fathead minnows, but not to stimuli from pike fed mealworms. Damselflies are sympatric with fathead minnows in the population tested, and probably have many of the same predators. A response to stimuli from pike fed fathead minnows indicates that damselflies associate predation risk with stimuli from injured minnows. In a second experiment, responses of damselflies previously exposed to stimuli from pike fed one of the three treatment diets (damselfly, fathead minnow or mealworm) were tested for a response to stimuli from pike fed mealworms. Damselflies that had been exposed to stimuli from pike fed damselflies or fathead minnows in the first experiment responded to stimuli from pike fed mealworms in the second experiment, but damselflies exposed to pike fed mealworms in the first experiment did not. Thus (1) pike-naive damselflies may initially respond to chemical stimuli from pike based on stimuli of conspecifics or familiar heterospecifics in the pike's diet, and (2) damselflies can learn to recognize chemical stimuli of pike irrespective of the pike's recent feeding regime based on the initial association with damselflies or minnows in the pike's diet.

AB Sibling asymmetries in asynchronously hatching jackass penguin, Spheniscus demersus, broods allow more efficient resource use than in artificially synchronized broods. Behaviour that determines food allocation and maintains weight asymmetries between siblings was examined. Total time spent begging and feeding by each chick during a feeding episode was measured at seven two-chick and 43 singleton nests, with repeat observations spanning the entire fledging period. First-hatched (A) chicks either obtained more feeding time, or begged less for the same feeding time, than their siblings (B-chicks) in all but one age category (21-40 days). At this age increasing demands for food associated with rapid growth, coupled with increasing mobility, appeared to intensify competition, and A-chicks had to beg longer for the same feeding time than their siblings. By 41-60 days A-chicks were again gaining more feeding time than B-chicks. A-chicks were better coordinated, using their weight advantage effectively during scramble feeding. A- and B-chicks generally spent more time begging for a given amount of feeding time than did singletons. A-chicks fed more at the beginning than at the end of a feeding episode, while B-chick feeding rate remained the same, suggesting a drop in A-chick feeding rate due to satiation, which may prevent asymmetries from becoming too large. In this way A-chicks maintain their weight and competitive advantage, without risking B-chick starvation when food supplies are adequate for both siblings.

TI Ant wars: Combat strategies, territory and nest defence in the
   leaf-cutting ant Atta laevigata
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID GLAND SECRETION
AB Two laws have been highlighted when discussing combat strategies in ants: the linear law (in a series of one-to-one conflicts, a few good fighters are better than many poor fighters) and the square law (if all individuals are vulnerable to attack, numerous fighters are more advantageous than a few good fighters). The leaf-cutting ant, Atta laevigata, responded to a simulated vertebrate threat by recruiting many soldiers (large workers), but responded to conspecific and interspecific ant threats by recruiting mainly small ants. In staged intraspecific interactions in the field between adjacent nests, ants were reluctant to fight on unmarked land and often retreated onto established marked trails, retreated to the nest entrance which they then capped or guarded, or immediately began marking the battle site with Dufour's gland secretion. These results indicate that the territorial behaviour of A. laevigata is part of a complex system to defend resources, where the defence of one resource (food) can develop into the defence of another (the nest). During the build-up of a war, once individuals from two nests met, recruitment changed from medium and large ants to mainly small ants. II is suggested that A. laevigata uses the soldier caste to defend the nest against large organisms and recruits numerous small ants in response to conspecific and interspecific ant threats following the square law.

AB Self-grooming may provide a means for broadcasting scent to conspecifics. Four experiments investigated this hypothesis in meadow voles. In the first experiment, male voles but not female voles groomed more in response to scent from an opposite-sex conspecific than a same-sex conspecific. In the second experiment, male voles groomed more in response to ovariectomized females receiving replacement oestradiol than to ovariectomized females receiving no oestradiol replacement. Self-grooming by female voles did not vary with the reproductive state of male scent donors. In the third experiment, males showed no difference in grooming in response to odours of a short-photoperiod male versus a short-photoperiod female, again indicating that the grooming response of males depends on the reproductive state of scent donors. These three experiments all suggested a communicative function for scent-elicited grooming. In the final experiment, the responses of females to males that had engaged in self-grooming was examined. Females spent more time investigating scent collected from the anogenital area of a male that had recently self-groomed at a high rate than they did from a male that had groomed at a low rate. Thus self-grooming by males increases the attractiveness of at least one of their scents to females. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ID RED-WINGED BLACKBIRDS; MATERNAL DOMINANCE; MANIPULATION; ADJUSTMENT;
   SELECTION
AB Research on both mammals and birds suggests that parental features, such as body condition and dominance rank, could influence sex ratios. This study examined the effect of male and female dominance rank on hatching sex ratios in domestic chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus. Twenty-four dominant males and 24 subordinate males were each placed in a pen with eight females. Females that were mated to a dominant male in the first 3 weeks of the experiment were mated to a subordinate male in the second 3 weeks and vice versa. Sex ratios (number of females/male) at hatch were not directly affected by male and female dominance status. Females that were mated to a subordinate male in the first trial, however, produced more variable sex ratios in the second trial. This effect was not evident for females mated to dominant males first. In addition, both groups of females produced more daughters in the second trial than in the first, although this effect was only significant for females that mated with subordinate males first. The results did not support the hypothesis that females should alter the sex ratio of their offspring based on their own dominance status or that of their mates. They did provide evidence, however, that sex ratios in chickens may be indirectly influenced by the status of the male. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB The calls produced by many male insects function both to advertise the singer's location to potential mates and to repel rivals. Cyphoderris monstrosa (Orthoptera: Haglidae) males produce a song that is apparently typical of the acoustic behaviour of other ensiferan insects. The hearing sensitivity of this species does not match the frequency content of male song, however, such that both males and females are relatively insensitive to these signals. Males engage in prolonged territorial disputes that include both acoustic exchanges and overt aggression. The function of C. monstrosa song in territorial interactions between males was examined. The outcome of such interactions was correlated with the relative signalling abilities of the males involved: winning males were more sustained singers than losers. The occurrence of escalated aggression also varied with the males' acoustic behaviour: the winners of interactions in which escalated fights did not occur were stronger singers than the winners of interactions in which there were fights, and strong singers who were muted were still able to win territorial interactions, but faced more vigorous resistance from their opponents. The results demonstrate that the proportion of time spent singing is a true indication of a male's aggressive ability, and that males use this information during territorial interactions. Inter-male communication in this context is thus a function for acoustic signalling, which is not handicapped by limited hearing ability in this species.

AB When a male's paternity differs from one breeding attempt to another, the male's parental effort is expected to increase as paternity increases. Davies et al. (1992, Anim. Behav., 43, 729-745) and Whittingham et al. (1993, Anim. Behav., 46, 139-147) manipulated paternity in monogamous dunnocks, Prunella modular is, and tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, respectively and found that parental effort did not vary with paternity. Previous discussions of this topic are reviewed and various examples presented to illustrate that the optimal parental effort may not depend strongly on paternity. In contrast to Whittingham et al., it is argued that the existing data do not indicate a discontinuous relationship between effort and paternity. Reasons to be sceptical about attempts to infer the shape of the relationship between parental effort and offspring survival from the form of the relationship between paternity and parental effort are also presented.

AB The theoretical basis of Seyfarth's priority of access model of female cercopithecine grooming was critically examined and alternative models suggested. These models, named 'engagement', 'interference' and 'rank difference', generated different predicted grooming distributions by assuming the operation of different constraints. These constraints were, respectively, the time available for grooming, active interference on the part of higher ranked animals and a depression of grooming relations as rank difference between animals grew. These priority of access models were compared with observed grooming patterns in two groups of free-ranging olive baboons, Papio cynocephalus anubis: one large, one small. The fit of these models was poor. An alternative method of examining the effects of rank on grooming behaviour using multiple regression was successful. In the small troop the rank of the groomee explained a significant amount of the variance in grooming whilst the rank distance between groomer and groomee did not. In the large troop the opposite effect was found. In the light of these results the merits of bottom-up modelling versus top-down description are discussed. The question of group Size in primates and its relationship to social complexity are addressed. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB To better understand the relationship between mating behaviour, insemination and fertilization in birds, 233 mating trials were conducted with Japanese quail to determine the percentage of eggs laid that were fertile following a single confirmed or putative insemination. Fertilization success of single inseminations was highly variable. Insemination did not guarantee fertilization of any eggs; following one-third of the trials, no fertile eggs were laid. Only 3% of inseminations fertilized as many as eight eggs, making it unlikely that a single insemination could fertilize an entire clutch in this species. Forced copulations had the same fertilization success as other copulations, and thus could be a successful male reproductive strategy in this species. Voiding of foamy material containing sperm by the female shortly after copulation did not reduce fertilization success in any consistently significant manner. Fertilization success was unaffected by the presence of a hard-shelled egg in the uterus at the time of insemination. Trials in which the female ran from the male's initial approach resulted in fewer fertile eggs following insemination; that is, this behaviour predicted low fertilization success. Fertilization success was highly correlated and thus predictable if the same female was mated again with the same male, but was uncorrelated if she was mated with a different male or if the same male was mated with different females. These two predictors of fertilization success (female behaviour and male-female combination) are interpreted as evidence for female control of paternity via sperm selection (postcopulatory female choice).

AB Larvae from three populations of Chrysopa quadripunctata, a generalist predator with diverse habitat and prey associations, were reared under common environmental conditions and tested for patterns of variation in their feeding and defensive behaviour under two regimens. The results revealed two patterns: individual repeatability and geographical variation in specific larval activities. First, individual larvae expressed consistency in the propensity to camouflage themselves and in the priority they gave camouflaging versus feeding; they retained their characteristic levels of behaviour after two moults. Such consistency in the behaviour of a predatory arthropod has not been previously reported. Second, the larvae showed significant geographical variation in quantitative aspects of feeding and camouflaging, as well as in their responsiveness to camouflaging material (behavioural plasticity). The pattern of geographical variation in larval behaviour reflects the differential characteristics of the prey that these populations encounter in nature. We conclude that disparate prey resources can lead to the differentiation of locally adapted larval behaviour and the evolution of specialization.

SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

   PROPAGATION; ACOUSTICS
AB Twenty-one representative vocalizations of two species of rain forest monkeys (blue monkeys, Cercopithecus mitis, and grey-cheeked mangabeys, Cercocebus albigena) and two species of savanna monkeys (vervet monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops, and yellow baboons, Papio cynocephalus) were broadcast in both rain forest and savanna habitats. Broadcast signals were re-recorded at distances of 12.5 and 100 m, digitized, and analysed on a supercomputer to measure the magnitude of distortion of the vocal repertoires of the savanna and forest monkeys in both the 'appropriate' and 'inappropriate' habitats. Independent distortion analyses were conducted in the time and frequency domains. The results showed that (1) distortion was strong following transmission distances of only 12.5 m in both habitats, (2) distortion scores were further increased, but only by a modest amount, when transmission distance was increased, (3) distortion scores were greater in the savanna habitat than in the rain forest habitat, (4) rain forest monkey calls were distorted less in the 'appropriate' rain forest habitat than in the 'inappropriate' savanna habitat, but (5) savanna monkey calls were similarly distorted in both habitats. The results were consistent with the idea that the rain forest environment is generally more favourable for high-fidelity sound propagation, and that selection for reduced distortion has more strongly influenced the physical form of the vocal repertoire of the two rain forest species than that of the two savanna species.

AB Two experiments were conducted to assess the influence of agonistic relationships among male guppies on their sexual and aggressive behaviour under different social conditions. In experiment 1, each male of small mixed-sex groups of guppies was systematically removed and reintroduced to the group. Only during the alpha male reintroduction were there any changes in the sexual behaviour of the remaining males; the female-preferred sigmoid display of the beta males was depressed. During reintroductions, the alpha male was responsible for most aggression directed towards the reintroduced male. Females also responded aggressively towards the reintroduced males, particularly the alpha male. In experiment 2, an unfamiliar male was introduced to each established mixed-sex group. Again, rank-related behaviour was evident; most aggression directed towards the unfamiliar male was performed by the alpha male. The unfamiliar male also performed fewer sigmoid displays than did the alpha male. Thus, agonistic relationships among males may be responsible for suppression of sexual behaviour by subordinate and non-resident males and should be considered as a factor in sexual selection processes in guppies.

AB Cheek rubbing is thought to be a form of active scent marking in many terrestrial and arboreal sciurids. However, some observations of arboreal sciurids suggest that cheek rubbing may also be a form of self-grooming. The purpose of this study was to examine possible functions of cheek rubbing by free-living Abert squirrels, Sciurus aberti. When the frequencies of behaviour patterns that occurred within a cheek-rubbing sequence were compared to the frequencies of acts that occurred at other times, grooming and alert behaviour patterns had a higher probability of occurring, whereas travelling, nesting, and Various social behaviour patterns (such as chasing) had a significantly lower probability of occurring during cheek-rubbing sequences. Food-related behaviour patterns or grooming usually preceded cheek rubbing. Cheek rubbing also did not predominantly occur at home-range boundaries or at nest sites. Although passive scent marking cannot be ruled out, these results suggest that cheek rubbing by Abert squirrels has evolved more as a form of self-grooming to remove food residue, rather than as active scent marking.

   REJECTION IN DROSOPHILA-BIAURARIA
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID AURARIA COMPLEX; MELANOGASTER
AB The present study investigated the significance of song in sexual isolation in Drosophila biauraria. Interspecific copulation was not observed with a heterospecific D. triauraria male that had intact wings, although it was often observed when the male's wings were removed, indicating that heterospecific courtship song elicits female rejection, and prevents copulation. Artificially synthesized songs were played to a female with a wingless, antennaless male. The conspecific inter-pulse interval of artificial song increased mating frequency, whereas the heterospecific, longer or shorter, inter-pulse interval significantly decreased the frequency. The mating frequency with random noise and silence showed intermediate values. Female rejection behaviour was greater with heterospecific than with conspecific inter-pulse intervals of artificial song; with random song and silence female responses were intermediate. This indicates that the inter-pulse interval is used as a species discriminator in D. biauraria females. It is suggested that the female's ability to discriminate inter-pulse intervals and her responses, rejection and acceptance, have evolved under the influence of reinforcement, reproductive character displacement, or both, which triggered sexual selection.

AB The ability of adult Helix lucorum to follow skeleton photoperiod regimes of two 1-h light pulses in 24 h was examined, together with the effects of these on the animals' activity phase. The animals in all the experiments could be synchronized to skeleton photoperiods, and the mean peak of their activity depended on the time interval between the two light pulses. The phase responses of snails to the different skeleton photoperiods resembled those previously described for several species of insects. This study showed that a minimum night length is needed for H. lucorum to be able to retain its daily rhythmicity during the night, as has been previously proposed.

ID FEEDING RATES; MEAL SIZE; SHEARWATERS; DEMAND; PARENT; ISLAND; GROWTH
AB The existence of a possible feedback mechanism, causally relating the nutritional status of nestling British storm petrels to the subsequent rates of food provisioning by their parents, was examined using a supplementary feeding experiment. There were no differences in parental provisioning behaviour between experimental and control groups before the supplementary feeding regime commenced. Thereafter, chicks receiving supplementary food showed higher levels of body condition (attributable to the experimental protocol), and consequently received smaller and less frequent meals from their parents than controls. The total amount of food received by the experimental group (parental delivery plus supplementary food) was similar to the amount delivered by control parents, indicating compensatory regulation of provisioning. These results support earlier findings at the same colony but are in contrast to similar studies on other procellariiform species elsewhere. The demonstration of regulation of food delivery casts doubt on hypotheses relating slow growth and lipid accumulation of procellariiform nestlings to scarce and unpredictable food resources, and indicates that more recent explanations relating lipid deposition to chronic overprovisioning by the adults are untenable for this species.

AB The capacity of the primitive ant Ectatomma tuberculatum to discriminate between nestmate and alien conspecific larvae in choice situations in relation to worker's age, social status and early experience was investigated. Brood discrimination was measured in terms of behavioural acts (licking, transport, antennation). Only 2-10-week-old adults preferred nestmate larvae, as they specialized in nursing. Younger as well as older workers were unable to discriminate brood. Teneral workers learned to recognize and prefer nestmate brood, even if it was unrelated (adopted from an alien conspecific colony). The familiarization learning was always very labile, however. A temporary estrangement from brood was enough for a worker to lose either the template of recognition cues, or the capacity to display preferential behaviour.

ID TEMPORAL POLYETHISM; TASK ALLOCATION; SUPERORGANISM; COLONIES
AB This paper investigates how the movement zones of all the ants in a colony are organized inside the nest. The workers in nine colonies of the ant Leptothorax unifasciatus (Latr.) were marked individually and their positions in the nest were recorded over 33 periods of observation spread throughout the year. Results from randomization tests demonstrated that the individual workers in L. unifasciatus colonies had movement zones of limited area. These are termed spatial fidelity zones (SFZs). SFZs were specific to individuals. They occurred with partial overlap, in a sequence from the colony centre to the colony periphery. The size of SFZs increased from the centre of the colony towards the periphery. The median size of SFZ in a colony varied with the time of year; they expanded gradually after hibernation with a peak in May and then contracted gradually until the following hibernation. The frequency of a worker's brood care behaviour was related to the amount of overlap between her SFZ and the spatial distribution of the brood. Individuals on the periphery of the colony were most likely to leave the nest. No clear segregation on the basis of age was observed. The division of labour in L. unifasciatus was flexibly organized along the continuum of SFZs where each worker performed the tasks within her spatial fidelity zone.

ID SEXUAL SELECTION; FEMALES COPY; FALLOW DEER; LEKKING; LEKS; OTHERS;
   MALES; COSTS
AB Recent field studies of lekking birds and mammals have provided evidence that mate selection in these mating systems may be affected partly by females copying the choices of others. Two pieces of evidence from black grouse, Tetrao tetrix, leks consistent with this view are presented. First, data on the temporal distributions of natural matings at 19 leks show that after being chosen by one female, a male is more likely to be chosen by others. Second, in an experiment in which dummy females were placed on males' territories, more females were attracted to the territories on days when males were able to copulate with the dummies. This result was not repeated in two other treatments when males were presented with dummies with which they were not able to copulate or with decoys of ducks. This suggests that copulation itself makes a male more attractive to females, although several other cues might also have contributed to the responses observed in these experiments.

AB The songs of wild adult European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were recorded over successive years to determine whether repertoire size and composition changed between years. Repertoire-size estimates increased between the first and last year of recording for five of seven males that were at least 2 years old when first recorded. All seven birds showed extensive changes in the composition of their repertoires. Many phrase types were dropped from the repertoire, and others were modified. All birds added many new phrase types to their repertoires between years. These results indicate that extended song learning occurs in adult starlings, even in birds that are at least 4 years old, and that repertoire size is correlated with age in this species. The influence of song repertoire size on male-male competition and possibly female mate choice may be related to its value as an indicator of male age.

AB In the sexually dichromatic sand lizard the area of the nuptial green coloration in males is allometrically related to body mass, and males with higher fighting ability have more saturated nuptial colours. Experiments in the laboratory showed that the extent of the bright nuptial coloration in males affects their contest behaviour; manipulated males with more colour were more likely both to initiate contests and to win. Further, when manipulated males had badges of unequal size the contests were settled more quickly than when the badges were the same size. This predicts that superior fighters with larger badges should have higher mating success; this was confirmed by held studies of a natural population.

TI SONG AND INFORMATION ABOUT AGGRESSIVE RESPONSES OF BLACKBIRDS,
   TURDUS-MERULA - EVIDENCE FROM INTERACTIVE PLAYBACK EXPERIMENTS WITH
   TERRITORY OWNERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID AGONISTIC DISPLAYS; BIRD SONG; BEHAVIOR; COMMUNICATION; RECOGNITION;
   TREEFROG; DIALECTS
AB A combination of normal (one-way), interactive (two-way) and randomized ''interactive'' (one-way) playback experiments were used to examine whether territorial blackbird males can use song to communicate varied information about their short-term intentions in agonistic situations. The study supports earlier analyses suggesting that low intensity song (LI) is least likely to be followed by attacks by the singer, whereas high intensity song (HI) is intermediate and strangled song (SS) is most likely to be followed by attacks. With normal playback, LI released the weakest, and HI and SS the strongest aggressive responses. Interactive playback, i.e. changing between LI, HI and SS in a natural way with the behaviour of the test bird, released even stronger responses. Randomized ''interactive'' playback, i.e. changing between LI, HI and SS independently of the behaviour of the test birds, released weaker responses than interactive playback. This indicates that the naturalness, rather than the variation of the sound stimulation, caused the strong responses to the latter. The results from interactive playback support the idea that SS indicates the most aggressive response of the singer. The escalations represented by the changes from HI to SS were apparent, however, only when the changes in song type were interactive. In other words, the interaction between the song type and the behaviour of the test bird was essential for the communicative value of SS. It is suggested that the adaptive significance of communicating such varied information about aggression lies in its relatively safety and energy efficiency. Bluffing as a widespread strategy may have been prevented because the differences between the types of song in production costs and how conspicuous they make the singer make bluffing more costly.

TI DO THE COLORS OF PARENTS, COMPANIONS AND SELF INFLUENCE ASSORTATIVE
   MATING IN THE POLYCHROMATIC MIDAS CICHLID
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Most of the polychromatic Midas cichlids, Cichlasoma citrinellum, in Nicaragua are normally coloured (normal) but about 8% lack melanophores and are thus gold coloured (gold). Previous work in the field and laboratory has shown that when fish are free to interact they mate assortatively by colour; how this is achieved is unknown. Female choice of mate by colour when only visual information is available could result from previous experience with colour of parents, companions or self.  Alternatively, choice could reflect an inherent bias: females might select normal males because they bear the ''primitive'' colour pattern, or females that have genes for a particular colour morph might choose males of that colour. The females fell into nine different groups according to colour of their parents, companions (siblings, after parental care had ceased) and their own colour. Females visited males of either colour morph, normal or gold, viewing them through one-way mirrors. Females responded significantly more to normal males than to gold ones, but not consistently so; we argue that this bias was due to the ''primitive'' colour effect. Colour of parents and of companions had weaker but nevertheless significant effects on female responses whereas the female''s own colour did not. Assortative matings may result from an indirect effect of gold on aggressiveness.

TI LEKKING IN TOPI - A CONSEQUENCE OF SATELLITE BEHAVIOR BY SMALL MALES AT
   HOTSPOTS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male topi, Damaliscus lunatus, either defend large territories containing food resources or join leks. In this study there was large variation in mating success on leks with a few males getting the majority of matings. Resource territories attracted more females than the territories of unsuccessful males on leks. All males on leks spent more time in contest behaviour than males in resource territories so that the majority of lek males that obtained few matings incurred high costs and low  benefits. The reason that unsuccessful males stay on leks, rather than adopt the less costly alternative of resource defence, may be that they are smaller than males in resource territories and thus unable to win fights to acquire resource territories. Although successful territories were scattered through the study lek, two small territories near the centre consistently attracted many more females than any others. This pattern persisted regardless of which male was in residence; the females  even came to these territories when the owner was absent. The ability to hold a successful lek territory could be a more reliable indicator of competitive ability, and thus fitness, than any single phenotypic characteristic. Leks may develop from groups of successful resource territories. In the case of topi, the desirable feature of these territories is probably a resting area in open habitat where females concentrate for anti-predator advantage. It is proposed that leks appear when small,  satellite males of low resource-holding potential cluster around the males in these successful territories.

TI INTERRUPTING AN ASSESSMENT PROCESS TO PROBE CHANGES IN THE MOTIVATIONAL
   STATE
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The ease of distraction of hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus, during shell investigation was examined in an attempt to probe changes in motivational state that are dependent upon the acquisition of information during an assessment process. The crabs recovered sooner from a startling stimulus if they were (1) approaching or manipulating a high quality shell or (2) occupying a poor quality shell. The startle response lasted longer when the novel stimulus was given at an early stage of investigation. The subsequent aperture investigation was longer when the novel stimulus occurred early in the shell assessment and was long when the startle response was long. These data are discussed with respect to information gathering and attentional and motivational change.

TI INVESTIGATION OF CONSPECIFIC MALE ODORS BY FEMALE PRAIRIE VOLES
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Female prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster, spent more time investigating odours from the anogenital and mouth regions of non-sibling than sibling males, and discriminated saliva and urine of siblings from those of non-sibling males. Among non-sibling dyads, nose-to-nose contacts were brief but frequent and decreased over each 10-min interval of the test; female contacts with the male anogenital region were less frequent, longer lasting and did not decrease during the 30-min test period. The possible functions of different male odours and female behavioural responses to these odours are discussed in relation to their potential role in conspecific identification and oestrus-induction in this species.

TI BEHAVIORAL AND ECOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF MALE AND FEMALE PARENTAL CARE
   AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN BURYING BEETLES (NICROPHORUS SPP)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Burying beetles (Coleoptera:Silphidae, Nicrophorus) from a natural population in southern New Hampshire [USA] were attracted to small carcasses which they were induced to bury into jars to rear broods. The duration of male and female parental care and their resulting reproductive success were measured by capturing departing parents and, later, their eclosing offspring. In all four species, N. orbicollis, N. sayi, N. defodiens and N. tomentosus, females provided significantly longer  care than males. The principal determinant of the duration of maternal care in N. orbicollis, the focal species in this study, was carcass weight; females provided longer care on larger carcasses. Although males provided shorter care on the smallest carcasses, the duration of male care was not strongly associated with carcass weight or male or female size. Carcass weight was the major determinant of total brood weight, the best single measure of reproductive success, but offspring size was  most strongly affected by the duration of maternal care. Broods begun in the first few weeks of the breeding season were heavier than later broods, perhaps due to less intense competition with flies at this time of year or brood order. First broods were significantly heavier than subsequent broods in the laboratory. The influence of behavioural and ecologicalfactors on individual variation in parental investment and reproductive success are discussed in the context of the evolution of the roles  of each parent in provisioning and guarding offspring.

TI SOCIAL-CONTEXT AND COURTSHIP FLEXIBILITY IN MALE SAILFIN MOLLIES,
   POECILIA-LATIPINNA (PISCES, POECILIIDAE)
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male sailfin mollies exhibit patterns of sexual behaviour directly related to body size: large males exhibit higher rates of courtship displays and lower rates of forced insemination attempts. Male sailfin mollies from three size classes were examined with a repeated-measures design to investigate the extent to which an individual will alter the rates at which different sexual behaviours are expressed in response to short-term changes and male size distributions in small groups. Small and large males did not respond to changes in male size distributions, but intermediate-sized males did. When alone, intermediate-sized males exhibited rates of behaviour that were intermediate between rates exhibited by small and large males. When other males were present, regardless of their body sizes, the same intermediate-sized males shifted their behaviour patterns toward those of small males. When intermediate-sized males were placed with males of different body sizes, they exhibited  behaviour patterns that were indistinguishable from those of small males. Significant differences among individuals were exhibited within all three size classes, but intermediate-sized males exhibited the highest level of differences among individuals. These results suggest that behavioural variation in natural populations will be more discontinuous in character than has been supposed previously, with variation resembling more a set of alternative tactics conditional on size than a gradation of  variable behaviours correlated with size.

AB The effects of lunar light on the activity of old-field mice, Peromyscas polionotus, were determined by tracking in outdoor enclosures. Surface activity was inhibited by about 70% in full moon, 56% in three-quater moon, 32% in half moon and 23% in quarter moon. The mice shifted their activity from the open area to cover during moonlit periods, thus inhibition in open areas was greater than indicated above. Activity patterns were not related to proximate foraging requirements, as food was provided ad libitium in the centre of the enclosures.

TI COALITIONS, COOPERATION AND REPRODUCTIVE TACTICS AMONG ADULT MALE
   BABOONS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Male savanna baboons, Papio cynocephalus, form coalitions with each other as a technique for gaining access to a female in consort with another male. Reciprocal altruism has been involved as the primary mechanism which underlies this reproductive tactic, but a 19-month field study of the reproductive behavior of olive baboons, P. c. anubis, in Kenya contradicted this interpretation. Males who solicited others for coalition formation were not more likely to gain access to consort females than were their fellow coalition members. Males who refused to participate in a coalition at one time were still sought as coalition partners at other times by the same male. Coalitions were generally formed by older, middle- to lower-ranking males and targeted at younger, higher-ranking males. Coalitions are a low risk reproductive tactic and the benefits are not partitioned according to initiator/joiner status. Coalitions are likely to be an outcome of cooperation between males which results  from the pursuit of self-interest.

TI SOCIAL FORAGING IN CLIFF SWALLOWS - LOCAL ENHANCEMENT, RISK SENSITIVITY,
   COMPETITION AND THE AVOIDANCE OF PREDATORS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Colonially nesting cliff swallows, Hirundo pyrrhonota, in southwestern Nebraska, U.S.A., often forage socially, in groups of two to more than 1000 individuals, on ephemeral concentrations of insects. Social foraging was promoted through information transfer among individuals at fixed colony sites, and through local enhancement in which foraging activities of some individuals attracted others to a food source. Cliff swallows feeding in groups had greater average foraging success (prey capture  attempts per min) than birds feeding solitarily. Variance in prey capture success, and thus foraging risk, declined with group size and was greatest for solitary foragers. Solitary cliff swallows whose foraging success equalled or exceeded that expected from social foraging remained solitary during a given foraging bout. Solitary foragers whose success fell below that expected from social foraging joined foraging groups. For individuals foraging socially there was no consistent relationship  between foraging success and group size, indicating little competition among group members for food and little resource depression. Social foraging in cliff swallows is probably not an adaptation mainly to decrease individuals'' risk of predation because foraging success did not differ for birds foraging on the edges versus in the centres of groups, and individuals foraging on the edges did not try to move toward the centre. These data are consistent with risk-sensitive foraging models and provide the first empirical demonstration with free-living animals that social foraging is associated with decreased individual variance in foraging success.

   MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Free-ranging vervet monkeys, Cercopithecus aethiops, who had learned to ignore playbacks of one type of call by an unreliable signaller subsequently also ignored playback of an acoustically different call by the same individual if the calls had similar referents. Such transfer did not occur if either the identity of the signaller changed or if the two calls had different referents. After repeatedly being played an intergroup call in the absence of other groups, vervets also ignored an  acoustically different intergroup call given by the same individual. The monkeys did not transfer habituation, however, if the new call was given by a different individual. In tests where the referents of two calls were different, the monkeys also failed to transfer habituation across call types. Vervet monkeys who had learned to ignore an unreliable leopard alarm call did not later ignore an eagle alarm call, even when the signaller remained the same. Results suggest that vervets, like humans,  process information at a semantic, and not just an acoustic, level.

TI HOW WESTERN MEADOWLARKS CLASSIFY THEIR SONGS - EVIDENCE FROM SONG
   MATCHING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Song matching during playback experiments was used to assess how western meadowlarks, Sturnella neglecta, classify variants of their primary song. In separate trials, subjects were played renditions of song types of strangers that they had in their own song repertoires and songs that were similar to their own, but of different types. Birds matched those song types that they had in their own repertoires, but responded to similar songs of different types with song types apparently chosen at  random. When half-songs were used as playback stimuli, subjects were able to classify song types correctly using cues present only in the introductory portions of songs. These findings suggest that the song types human observers recognize as ''natural'' units in the repertoire of this species are also recognized by the birds. A four-level classification of the variation in western meadowlark song is discussed.

TI HUNGRY RATS FOLLOWING OF CONSPECIFICS TO FOOD DEPENDS ON THE DIETS EATEN
   BY POTENTIAL LEADERS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rats, Rattus norvegicus, familiar with maze procedures reliably followed conspecific leaders in a maze. Rats trained to follow in a maze followed leaders that had eaten a food known to the follower to be safe, with higher probability than they followed leader that had eaten a food known to the follower to be poisonous. Thus, rats have the capacity both to follow conspecifics to feeding sites and to choose conspecifics to follow on the basis of the desirability of the foods those conspecifics have been eating. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that aggregation sites of rats in natural environments might serve as information centres where unsuccessful foragers could select more successful colony-mates to follow to food.

TI SEARCH PATHS OF FORAGING COMMON SHREWS SOREX-ARANEUS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The searching behaviour of common shrews, Sorex araneus, was observed as they foraged for prey hidden in a grid of wells in a small arena. The search paths are described and their efficiency compared to that of a simulation model. The shrews searched more efficiently than a random (neutral) model, and were approximately as efficient as the ''optimal'' model. The efficiency of the model, however, declined more rapidly than that of the shrews with increasing length of search path. It is probable that the shrews were able to increase their searching efficiency by remembering where they had searched: the shrews are shown to have used a simple memory rule, namely alternating right and left turns.

TI DEVELOPMENTAL PATHWAYS IN BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Much behaviour changes gradually in frequency during development. It is possible to argue for the existence of rules that govern such changes, to distingush between directing and stopping rules, and to identify several different kinds of directing and stopping rules. Directing rules can be postulated that involve an instantaneous assessment of rate of performance of behaviour by the young animal or a cumulative asessment of amount of behaviour performed, and that also involve age-dependent or age-independent set points. Stopping rules may be performance-dependent or performance-independent. The evidence for these various rules is discussed, together with their functional significance.

TI DIRECTIONALITY OF SINGING AND NON-SINGING BEHAVIOR OF MATED AND UNMATED
   NORTHERN MOCKINGBIRDS, MIMUS-POLYGLOTTOS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Early in the breeding season, unmated male northern mockingbirds displayed greater variability in singing direction within bouts of song than did mated males. Unmated males also sang more and used a greater proportion of singing perches in the interior of their territories than mated males. Although unmated males used more singing perches than mated males, they used fewer in proportion to the amount of song. Both unmated and mated males frequently sang into or across their territories, although mated males sang into their territories to a greater degree. Neither class of males directed song exclusively out of their territories when singing near boundaries. Unmated males also performed more visual displays associated with singing. Mated males chased both conspecifics and heterospecifics more than did unmated males. These findings support the hypothesis that mockingbird song at this time of the breeding season functions largely in male-female interactions.

TI THE LAZY, ADAPTABLE LIONS - A MARKOVIAN MODEL OF GROUP FORAGING
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB A Markovian decision model of the group foraging behaviour of lions, Panthera leo, in the Serengeti was formulated. The Markovian model predicts that, unless they have failed to eat for several days, lions maximize their fitness by a ''satisficing'' type of behavior, in which the size of foraging groups is such that each lion simply obtains its daily food requirement in the event of a successful kill. Hungry lions should hunt in smaller, but not necessarily satisficing groups. The predictions are compared with those of earlier models based on the hypothesis of feeding-rate maximization, and both predictions are compared with the observations of G. Schaller.

TI THE DISCRIMINATION OF DIFFERENT DEGREES OF RELATEDNESS IN THE RAT -
   EVIDENCE FOR A GENETIC IDENTIFIER
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Rats were given a simultaneous choice of unfamiliar, same-sex, age-mate conspecifics of four different degrees of relatedness (siblings, paternal half-siblings, cousins and unrelated) and their investigation time was measured. The results revealed a linear trend between relatedness and investigation time, rats showing greater investigation as the degree of relatedness decreased. The results indicate that rats posses an identifier which can be used to discriminate different degrees of kinship.  Further, this identifier is possessed by kin in direct proportion to their relatedness, i.e. siblings possess 50% of the identifier in common, cousins 12.5%, etc. The importance of the linearity of the trend for the process of phenotype matching is discussed. The advantages of this identifier being produced by an individual''s genes are considered and the possible influence of microorganisms discussed.

TI A METHOD FOR RATING THE INDIVIDUAL DISTINCTIVENESS OF DOMESTIC CATS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Fourteen adult female domestic cats were watched by two observers for 3 months. Ratings of 18 aspects of each cat''s behavioural style were obtained independently from each observer. Correlations between observers were statistically significant for 15 of the 18 aspects and seven of the correlation coefficients were greater than 0.7. The ratings were compared with results of direct recording methods, where equivalent measures were available and, in five out of six cases, the results of the ratings and direct methods were significantly correlated. The rating method is, therefore, generally reliable and can be adequately validated. Some assessments of observer ratings which are not obviously and easily realted to direct recordings may prove particularly useful in developmental studies of alternative modes of behaviour and the origins of individual differences.

TI AFFILIATION AND RECIPROCITY IN SIBLING AND PEER RELATIONSHIPS AMONG
   FREE-RANGING IMMATURE MALE RHESUS-MONKEYS
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB The social relationships of immature male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were studied during 1977, 1978 and 1981 and the Cayo Santiago colony, Puerto Rico. Three types of social relationship were selected for comparison: the sibling relationship, the strong peer relationship and the weak peer relationship. Sibling relationships were initially distinguished from peer relationships on the basis of individual characteristics (age and relatedness), whereas the 2 types of peer relationship were  initially differentiated on the basis of criteria that concerned their structure. Although the 3 types of relationships showed certain similarities these were far outweighed by differences in the content, diversity, qualities and the relative frequency and patterning of their interactions, and the degree to which their interactions were characterized as reciprocal or complementary. These findings are discussed in relation to a number of questions concerning the structure of relationships and the 3 types of relationship can be contrasted in terms of a multidimensional quality, their degree of affiliation.

TI STATISTICAL COMPARISON OF PROXIMITY MATRICES - APPLICATIONS IN ANIMAL
   BEHAVIOR
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
AB Animal behavior studies often require the diagnosis and statistical evaluation of patterns among individuals of a group. However, association values derived for all pairs of individuals are mathematically interrelated and, hence, difficult to evaluate. A general method of matrix comparison, called the Mantel test, is discribed which accounts for such interdependencies. In this test, 2 square difference matrices are compared to determine whether a statistical association exists between corresponding elements. For example, distances in one of the matrices might represent differences in songs for each pair of a group of birds, while distances in the other matrix could be the geographic distances between each of the same bird pairs; the test would assess whether or not birds close to one another have songs that are more similar than those pairs that are located further apart geographically. Distances in the matrices can be of a variety of sorts (dependeing on the application),  including for instance geographic distances, morphological differences, or behavioral differences. The test has wide applicability in studies of animal behavior, and 3 examples are presented. First, dialects of splendid sunbirds (Nectarinia coccinigaster) were investigated to determine whether local or regional patterns of geographic variation in song were present, and whether birds with similar dialects were concentrated within the same habitat. Second, dominance hierarchies of white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicolis) and dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis oreganus) were analyzed by constructing appropriate hypothesis matrices that were contrasted against a matrix summarizing behavioral interrelationships of flock members. In the 3rd application, involving progressions of yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus), an approach was developed to assess whether members of a given sex occur adjacent (or at least closer) to one another in progression order more often than expected by chance, and also whether individuals of a given sex tend to be found at or near the end of a progression more frequently than predicted. Other possible applications of the Mantel test are discussed and a detailed computational example is included.
